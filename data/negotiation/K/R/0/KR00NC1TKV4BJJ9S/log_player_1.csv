Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair price considering its potential worth."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible, but we need to incentivize Bob to buy.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it above that is crucial. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's valuation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, which gives us leverage. We don't need to go below that price.

**The message is carefully worded to:**

* **Highlight value:**  Instead of just stating a price, it emphasizes the product's ""unique features"" and ""potential worth.""
* **Appear reasonable:** Using phrases like ""fair price"" can make the offer seem more palatable."
