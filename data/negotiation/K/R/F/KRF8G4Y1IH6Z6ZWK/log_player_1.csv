"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could we work something out closer to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,075,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $987,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but we're still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to hold firm to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer.  To show I'm serious about making this work, I'll come down to $1,030,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1030000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm making a smaller concession this round to signal I'm nearing my bottom line. The message emphasizes this is my best offer to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. It seems like we're close. How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,008,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,008,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,008,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer at $1,008,750 surpasses my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away or the deal falling through. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk ending up with nothing."
