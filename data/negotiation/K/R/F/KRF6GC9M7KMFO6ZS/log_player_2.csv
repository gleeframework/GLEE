{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down, and even if she doesn't, you can still choose to buy from John for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the realm of possibility.  This is a strong opening move that signals my seriousness in negotiating a lower price. I'm aiming to find a middle ground where both Alice and I can benefit from the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I'm not ready to give up on negotiating a better price. By rejecting her offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to get even closer to my desired price point. There's still a chance she might come down further, or I can always choose to buy from John if the price remains too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer to $900,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a price that's closer to my desired budget. This is a more moderate increase than my previous counteroffer, aiming to show Alice that I'm willing to compromise while still holding firm on my budget."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's getting closer. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I want to try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John. If this offer is rejected, I'll likely buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final counteroffer. I'm offering Alice my maximum budget. I'm hoping she recognizes that I'm serious about buying the product and that this is the highest price I'm willing to pay. If she rejects this offer, I'll move forward and buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
