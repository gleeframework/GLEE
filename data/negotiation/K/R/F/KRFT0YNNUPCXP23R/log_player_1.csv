Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offers and is getting closer to our minimum acceptable price. However, we're still in the early rounds of negotiation, and we have room to push for a better deal. We'll counter-offer again to signal we're willing to negotiate but won't accept a low price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,050,000.  How about $1,075,000?"",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I still think $1,075,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has stuck to his offer of $1,050,000 for two rounds now, signaling this might be his upper limit.  While we could try to push for more, we're getting close enough to our minimum that the risk of losing the deal to get an extra few thousand isn't worth it. Accepting now secures a good profit above our minimum."
