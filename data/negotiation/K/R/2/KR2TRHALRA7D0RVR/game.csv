"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my expectations, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a stretch. I'm ready to invest $950,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and my ability to pay. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this point.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like, I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to invest a significant amount in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000.
