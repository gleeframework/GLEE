"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, it's worth a lot to someone like you.  I'm asking for $11,000. I think that's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,250? This allows us both to benefit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,250 is still a little high for me. How about we settle at $9,750? This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000.  Would you consider $10,100? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You're close to your desired price point, and Alice has stated this is her final offer.  It's in your best interest to accept and avoid risking going to John who is more expensive.  You'll still be able to save a significant amount compared to John's price."
