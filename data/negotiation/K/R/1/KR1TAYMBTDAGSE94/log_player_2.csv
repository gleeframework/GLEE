"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you on this amazing product! Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is much higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It's best to negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider something closer to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($60), we aim to establish a bargaining position that leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important to keep the negotiation amicable, even while bargaining aggressively.
* **Target in Mind:**  Our ultimate goal is to pay significantly less than $80. This counteroffer starts the process of working towards that goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do a bit better than that, but I'm not going all the way to $60. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice's counteroffer of $120 is lower than her initial offer, it's still significantly higher than both your target price and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate a better price. Alice seems willing to come down, and you haven't reached your maximum budget yet.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John's offer of $80 provides a safety net. If the negotiation with Alice doesn't reach a satisfactory price, you can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet at $80? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Limit:** This offer matches your maximum budget and John's offer. It's unlikely you'll find a better deal elsewhere.
* **Fairness Argument:**  By presenting this offer as a ""fair price"" and meeting in the middle of the previous round's offers, you create a stronger argument for Alice to accept.
* **Decision Point:** This offer will likely prompt a clear decision from Alice.  She'll either accept and you'll get the product at your desired price, or she'll counter, and you'll need to decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a serious buyer, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. How about we meet at $130? That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Movement:** Alice increased her offer from $120 to $130. This suggests she might be less flexible than initially thought.
* **Reached the Limit:** Your previous offer of $80 was your maximum budget. Going higher isn't a wise financial decision.
* **Reliable Alternative:** John offers a guaranteed price of $80, saving you $50 compared to Alice's latest offer.

It's clear that further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price you find acceptable. Opting for John's offer ensures you acquire the product at a price you're comfortable with."
