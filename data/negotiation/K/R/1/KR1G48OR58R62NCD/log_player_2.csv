"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's very fair.  Let's talk about a price of $1,250,000.  This gives you a significant saving and allows me to achieve a good price for the product.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, stating it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you when you know your upper limit.
* While $1,250,000 is less than John's offer, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's initial offer might lead to a better counter-offer."
