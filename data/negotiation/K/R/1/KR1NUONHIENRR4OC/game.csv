"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I think it's a good compromise between the value of the product and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly less than I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14,000? I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",14000.0,Bob,4,
