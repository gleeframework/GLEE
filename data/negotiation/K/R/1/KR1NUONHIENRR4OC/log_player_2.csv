# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly less than I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. Since she was willing to meet me in the middle at $17,000, I'll try to get a bit closer to my target price. I'll offer $14,000, which is still a significant discount from her original price.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14,000? I think it's a fair price for the product's value."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
