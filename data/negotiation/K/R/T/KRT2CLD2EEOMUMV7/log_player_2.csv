"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth a lot more than my asking price of $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is less than your maximum price, there's a good chance you could get a better deal. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and her message suggests she might be willing to go lower."
