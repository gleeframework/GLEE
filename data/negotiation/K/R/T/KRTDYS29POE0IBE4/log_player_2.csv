"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and it's a better deal than buying from John for $15,000. Accepting this offer saves you $2,000."
