"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I think it's worth $175, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to pay a little more. I'm also leaving room for negotiation to make the deal more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to go below my minimum.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low.  I'll try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round.  I'm also still keeping in mind that I can sell to John for $150 if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $130 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet in the middle at $140. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm close to my minimum, but Bob is still not willing to meet my price.  At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
