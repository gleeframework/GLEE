Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum value of $15,000 but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.  While I'm happy with $15,000, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial offer. I'll see if I can convince Bob to move closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm offering $16,500 as my counteroffer. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows good faith while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $16,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a fair deal that's a good compromise.  It's also important to note that if I reject this offer, I'm taking the risk of Bob walking away and me having to settle for John's offer of $15,000."
