Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your minimum:** You need to make at least $80 from the sale.
* **Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay up to $120.
* **Maximizing profit:**  Offering the product at $100 allows you to make a $20 profit, which is a good balance between getting the best price and ensuring Bob accepts. If you go too high, Bob might reject the offer."
