"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $900,000 is still more than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good starting point for negotiation. $750,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's offer and still within Bob's budget. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating, while also leaving room for compromise in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still above Bob's preferred price point.  He's looking to get the product for as close to $800,000 as possible. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his target.  There are still many rounds left, so there is time to see if a better deal can be reached with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to his target price of $800,000.  By offering $825,000, he's showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal.  This offer leaves room for Alice to negotiate slightly, but also demonstrates that Bob is serious about closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $835,000 is very close to Bob's target price of $800,000.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will either reject his counteroffer or make a counteroffer that is higher than $835,000.  With only a few rounds left, it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and secure the product for a price that is within his budget and only slightly higher than his target."
