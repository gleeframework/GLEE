You have three options:

You are looking to save money.  While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, you can likely do better than $12,000. Reject the offer and see if you can get Alice to lower the price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11250. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

Alice has met you halfway at $11,250. This is still a better price than John's offer of $15,000, and you're still saving a significant amount of money compared to Alice's original price.  Accept the offer and move on!"
