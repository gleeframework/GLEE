Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's value of $80, but below my minimum of $150. This leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I'm not giving it away too cheaply. I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $90 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 
I'm offering $100, which is still a bit higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while also keeping me above my minimum. I've also added a friendly message to continue building rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it. However, I am still looking to keep my spending within $80. Could we possibly agree on $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $100 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. This is a fair price for both of us and ensures a win-win situation. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping this final counteroffer will be enough to secure the deal without having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to propose $95 as the final price, which is within my budget and still fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  While I'd prefer to get a slightly better price, the negotiations with Bob have gone on long enough and it's clear we're not going to agree on a price that works for both of us.  Selling to John will ensure I get my minimum price and avoid further delays."
