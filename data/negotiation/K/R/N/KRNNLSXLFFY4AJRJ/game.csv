"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, Bob. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
