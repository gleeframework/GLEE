Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, Bob. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and it's above our maximum budget. While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will budge, and we risk losing out on the guaranteed price of $8,000 from John."
