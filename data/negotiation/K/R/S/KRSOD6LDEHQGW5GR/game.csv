"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000, which is still a significant amount.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, and I'm glad you see the value in this product. However, $850000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950000. This is a compromise that I think we can both be happy with. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950000 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $900000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $925000, which is a compromise that should work for both of us. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
