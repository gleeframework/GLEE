"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a significant amount.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, and I'm glad you see the value in this product. However, $850000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950000. This is a compromise that I think we can both be happy with. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still $50,000 higher than Bob's maximum willingness to pay. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if they'll come down further.  There's still a chance to save money by continuing the negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $925000, which is a compromise that should work for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still $25,000 higher than his maximum willingness to pay.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000. Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk that they'll reach a stalemate, and Bob will lose the opportunity to buy at John's lower price."
