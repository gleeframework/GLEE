Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can do $6,800, which is my final offer. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?

Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While we could push for a slightly lower price, it's unlikely we'll get much further down, and we risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting at $6,800 is a good compromise, saving us a significant amount compared to John's offer."
