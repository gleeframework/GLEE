"I understand your desire to get the price down to $10,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $10,000. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
