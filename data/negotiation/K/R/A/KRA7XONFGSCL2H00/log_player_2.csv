"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $12,000. There's a chance you could get a better deal from Alice if you reject this offer."
