Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 allows room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Potential for Profit:** If Bob accepts this price, you make a $25 profit.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value. If you had more information, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
