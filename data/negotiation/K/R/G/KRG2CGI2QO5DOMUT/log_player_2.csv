"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and the high demand I'm seeing from other potential buyers, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,300,000 is significantly more than your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* **You have a better alternative:** John offers the product for $800,000, which is within your budget and saves you a considerable amount of money.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to purchase the product from John at a much more favorable price."
