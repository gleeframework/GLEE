Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him more interested in a deal.
* **Open-ended Question:**  I'm asking for Bob's opinion, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation and potentially reveal his own valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.**  While it's closer, I can still do better.
* **I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120.** This gives me leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going.** I can now make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm happy to come down a bit, but $90 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? This would still be a great price for you and a fair deal for me."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and emphasizing the benefit for Bob.
* **Reinforce My Position:**  I'm reminding Bob that $95 is still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.**  I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120.**  This is a better option than accepting Bob's offer and getting less. 
* **There's no guarantee that Bob will accept any further counteroffers.** I could end up stuck in a back-and-forth with no resolution. 

It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
