"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product. My revised offer is $1,075,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This feels like a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and the price I can get it for elsewhere.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I still think $1,060,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on investment. My revised offer is $1,080,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's worth and will give you a good deal, but I'm still willing to negotiate further if needed.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,070,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product. My revised offer is $1,090,000. I believe this is the lowest price I can accept and still meet my minimum requirements.",1090000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,085,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to ensure I'm getting a good return on investment. My revised offer is $1,100,000. I believe this is the minimum price I can accept, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1100000.0,Alice,9,
