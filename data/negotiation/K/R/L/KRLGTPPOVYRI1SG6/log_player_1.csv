"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $175. It's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.  This also signals to Bob that I'm serious about a good deal but I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can offer you $140 for the product. I hope this price works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum. While I could accept and secure a sale, I'm hoping to get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $160?  That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I would like to offer $150 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and it's likely that he won't budge further.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of him walking away entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale at my floor price."
