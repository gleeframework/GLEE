"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to a more agreeable price. Would you consider selling the product for $9,500? I'm looking to save as much money as possible while still acquiring the item.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is simply too low.  It's very important for me to get a fair price for this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250?  This way, we both get a good deal.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm hoping to keep the price closer to my initial budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $10,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
