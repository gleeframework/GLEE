"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $70? That's a fair price, and I'm eager to make this deal happen.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit lower than my target price. However, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $85. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",85.0,Alice,5,
