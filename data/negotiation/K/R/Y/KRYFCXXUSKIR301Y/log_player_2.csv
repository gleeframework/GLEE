Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $70? That's a fair price, and I'm eager to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit lower than my target price. However, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $85. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85, and you have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $80 from John. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed savings at this point."
