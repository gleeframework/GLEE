Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to feel confident that I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I'm not going any higher. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1,500,000.

While I could push for more, Bob's final offer of $1,250,000 is still a significant profit above my minimum. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a much better result, and I risk him walking away entirely. Accepting now secures a strong return."
