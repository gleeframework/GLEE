"Hey Alice,  $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $125. It's a fair price considering its value to you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I can offer you a compromise at $115. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think it's worth considering.",115.0,Alice,5,
