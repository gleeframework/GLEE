"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $1,400,000.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. You can always buy from John for a better price, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,300,000 is still too far off my target. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering the product for $1,325,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I hope you'll consider it.
