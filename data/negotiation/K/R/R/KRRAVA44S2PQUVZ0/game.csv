"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a significant step closer to your asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
