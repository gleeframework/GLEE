Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible, but still give Bob an incentive to buy.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it at that price or lower guarantees a sale but leaves a lot of money on the table.
* **John as Leverage:**  Mentioning other interested buyers (even though you'd sell to John at your desired price) creates a sense of scarcity and competition.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers. 

By offering the product at $950,000, you aim to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
