"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still significantly more than the product's value to Alice.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, so it's worth seeing if you can get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  You only want to go to John if you can't reach a mutually agreeable deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering your offer of $700,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** Although she moved from $900,000 to $850,000, it's still above the product's value to her and leaves little room for you to save.
* **You still have time to negotiate.** You're only in round 3, so there's no need to rush into accepting a price you're not comfortable with. 
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.**  You'll only go to John if you can't get a better price from Alice. 

**Next Steps:**  Counteroffer Alice with a price closer to your target price, but higher than your previous $700,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a fair price considering your valuation. Let's see if we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'll counteroffer at $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is close to your desired price.** You're trying to get the product for as close to $800,000 as possible, and $825,000 is only a small step away.
* **There's a risk of getting a worse deal.** If you keep rejecting, Alice might become less willing to negotiate, and you could end up paying more in future rounds.
* **You're still saving a significant amount.**  $825,000 is a substantial discount compared to John's $1,500,000 offer. 

**Conclusion:** This offer is a good compromise, and it's better to secure the product at this price than risk getting a worse deal in the future."
