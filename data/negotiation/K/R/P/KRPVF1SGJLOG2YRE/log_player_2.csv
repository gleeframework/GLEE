{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Alice's offer. $85 is more than I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping to get a better price. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

I'm offering $75 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and Alice's initial offer. Hopefully, she'll accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $80 is within my budget and I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially losing out on the product.  It's also the same price as John's offer, so I'm happy to accept."
