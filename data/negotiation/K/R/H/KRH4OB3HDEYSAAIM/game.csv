"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $130?  ",130.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, but I'm willing to come down a bit further to $140.  That's still a fair price for this high-quality product.  What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate further.  $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $135?  That's a fair compromise, and it's the most I'm willing to spend right now.",135.0,Bob,4,
