"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding an arrangement that works for both of us. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  This product has considerable value, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,850,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
