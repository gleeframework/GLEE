# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding an arrangement that works for both of us. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  This product has considerable value, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000.

Alice's offer of $1,850,000 is still too high.  It's worth rejecting and making another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."
