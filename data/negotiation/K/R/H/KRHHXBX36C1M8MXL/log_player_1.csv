Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $110, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the product's value while keeping the price as the main focus. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $90 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is too low. While it's tempting to take the quick sale, I'm aiming to get closer to my minimum price of $120. I'll counteroffer and try to get a better deal."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm reducing my price from $110 to $100.  This shows flexibility while still being closer to my minimum value.
