# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $8,000. Let's start there and see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,000.  It's a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $9,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about it. How about we try $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $10,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still not enough for me to meet my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about it. How about we try $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is unwilling to budge much further, and $11,500 is still above your budget. You've tried your best to negotiate, but you're close to running out of rounds. It's time to secure the product from John for your target price of $8,000."
