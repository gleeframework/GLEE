"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my original price. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me there.",9750.0,Bob,4,
