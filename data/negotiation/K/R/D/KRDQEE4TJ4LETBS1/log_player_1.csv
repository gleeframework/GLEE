Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target Price:** My goal is to maximize my profit, so I'm aiming for a price higher than John's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Risk Assessment:**  I'm taking a calculated risk by setting a higher price. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, but I'm confident that the potential reward outweighs the risk. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By offering $1,500,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters. This allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my ideal value. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. I'll be prepared to adjust my price based on Bob's response and my assessment of his interest in the product."
