"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is still significantly higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than Alice's offer, we create room for negotiation and signal that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and appreciative tone encourages continued negotiation.
* **Strategic Aim:**  While $85 is a lowball offer, it aims to bring Alice closer to our ideal price range (below $100) while leaving us space to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think it's worth a bit more than $85. How about we try $95? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $95 is a reasonable price, falling well within our $100 budget and saving us $5 compared to John's offer.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by meeting us halfway.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate for a lower price might be possible, but it risks Alice pulling back or us missing out on a good deal."
