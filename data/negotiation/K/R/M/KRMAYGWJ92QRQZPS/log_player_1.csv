{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Floor:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000, but John is a guaranteed buyer at that price. 
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000. 
* **Initial Offer:** My initial offer of $14,000 is a starting point. It's above Bob's value but leaves room for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

By starting at $14,000, I aim to:

* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** If he accepts, I've made a good profit.
* **Open a Negotiation:**  If he rejects, it gives him an incentive to counteroffer, allowing for potential negotiation towards a mutually beneficial price. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first step in the negotiation. I'll need to carefully consider Bob's counteroffers and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than his own stated value. 
* **My Floor:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my target. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for a low price. This sets the stage for further negotiation and potentially a higher counteroffer from Bob. I'm willing to risk a potential stalemate with Bob because I have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest,  $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $12,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Floor:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, so $12,500 is within his range.
* **Negotiation:** By making a counteroffer, I'm showing willingness to compromise while still being assertive. 

**Strategy:**

My counteroffer of $12,500:

* **Positions me closer to my target:** It's a reasonable compromise, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Preserves leverage:**  It's still higher than Bob's initial offer, allowing room for further negotiation. 
* **Keeps John as an option:**  If Bob rejects again, I can still turn to John for a guaranteed sale.

I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While $11,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **My Floor:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my target.  

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I'm signaling that I'm not willing to settle for a price that is significantly below my minimum. This keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to:

* **Push for a higher price:** I can counteroffer with a price closer to my target.
* **Keep John as an option:** If Bob rejects again, I can still sell to John for $15,000.

I'll need to carefully consider my next counteroffer, taking into account Bob's willingness to negotiate and my own desire to maximize profit."
