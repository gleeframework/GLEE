"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest,  $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $12,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,250 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product. What do you think?
