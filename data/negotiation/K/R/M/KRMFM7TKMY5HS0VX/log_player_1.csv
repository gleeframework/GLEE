"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a truly unique and valuable product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. My initial price for this product is $1,500,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth. Please consider this offer carefully, as I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** I have 10 rounds and can still counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback option:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.

I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is unfortunately far below the value of this product.  It's clear you see the potential here, so let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair margin.  Let's keep the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still concerned about the price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this strikes a balance between the product's worth and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation room:**  I have 6 rounds remaining and can continue negotiating. 
* **John as a backup:** I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fall apart.

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $950,000 is getting closer, but it's still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I think $1050000 is a bit high for what I'm willing to spend on this product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, there's a risk of not finding a better deal.
* **John as an alternative:** Even if I reject Bob's offer, I can still sell to John for the same price.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum desired price while avoiding the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
