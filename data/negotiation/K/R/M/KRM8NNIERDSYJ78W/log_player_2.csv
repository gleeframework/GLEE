```tool_code
It's better to accept the offer of $145 at this point. Here's why:

* **Negotiation Dynamics:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. While she might be bluffing, there's a real risk she won't budge further.
* **Savings:** You're already saving $55 from her initial offer. 
* **Alternative:** Buying from John gets you the product for $150, only a $5 difference from Alice's current offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge that gap completely.
