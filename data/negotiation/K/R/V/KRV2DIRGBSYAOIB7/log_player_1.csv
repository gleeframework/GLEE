Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($150). This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm also prepared to counter if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, but it's close. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm offering $160, which is still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to my desired price. This gives me some flexibility if he counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price. While I would prefer to sell to him, I'm not willing to go that low. Jhon is offering my minimum desired price, so it's more advantageous to sell to him."
