"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is close to your maximum, but there's still room for negotiation. You should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for you to come up to a price that works for both of you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $105 is the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested in that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, there's still room for negotiation between $105 and your ideal price. Let's see if we can get her to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $90 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $97?"",
""product_price"": 97
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows you are willing to compromise but also sets a firm target price close to your ideal outcome. It's crucial to remain firm in your goal of securing the best possible price."
