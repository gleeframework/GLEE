You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

Bob should offer Alice his maximum price of $12,000. This is a bold move, but since it's his absolute limit, there's no point in going higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget than her previous offer, it's still more than he's willing to pay. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob should offer Alice $13,000. This is a compromise between his maximum price and Alice's last offer. It's a reasonable counteroffer that shows he's willing to negotiate but still has a limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although $14,500 is getting closer to his maximum, he can still try to negotiate further.  It's worth trying to get a better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

Bob should offer Alice $13,500. This is a small increase from his previous offer, showing he's serious about buying but still trying to get a better deal. This is a good compromise point, and Alice might be more likely to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  While Alice has come down a bit, she's still above Bob's maximum.  Rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially getting stuck in a cycle of counteroffers, it's more efficient to go with John who offers the best price within Bob's budget."
