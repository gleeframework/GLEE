Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $130. I believe it would be highly valuable to you."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's potential to sell above your minimum ($100) and John's offer ($100).
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $130 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Above Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed $100 from John. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
