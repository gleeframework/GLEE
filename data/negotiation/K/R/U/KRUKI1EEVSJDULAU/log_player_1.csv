"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I can likely get closer to my target price of $1,000,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. How about $950,000?  That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about $850,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

While $850,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum goal of $800,000. I'll try to push for a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $850,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but  $900,000 is my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

While $875,000 is closer to my minimum, I think I can get a little more. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm determined to get the best deal possible."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close, but $875,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $887,500. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 887500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm not happy about selling to John for $800,000, it's better than taking Bob's final offer of $875,000. I'm only two rounds away from the final round and don't have a lot of room to maneuver. It's risky to reject Bob and try to get a higher price, as he might walk away, leaving me with nothing.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
