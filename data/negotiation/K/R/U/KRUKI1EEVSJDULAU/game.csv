"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. How about $950,000?  That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $850,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but  $900,000 is my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand we're close, but $875,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $887,500. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",887500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",875000.0,Bob,8,
