"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset with significant potential.  My initial offer is $1200000.  This price reflects its worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1200000 is too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  This price is fair considering its value and provides a healthy profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit low. Considering the product's value and my potential earnings, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
