Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value to gauge his interest. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  By starting high, I leave room for negotiation and potentially reach a price closer to my minimum value.
* **Test Bob's seriousness:**  If he rejects this offer, it indicates he's genuinely interested in negotiating.
* **Set the stage for a counteroffer:** This initial offer will likely prompt Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing us to  enter into a back-and-forth negotiation.

While I'm open to negotiation, I have a fallback option with John, ensuring I won't settle for less than my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer as it's still a profit, it's not a good use of my negotiation leverage.  I'm going to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. 

My reasoning:

* **Maintain my position:** Accepting such a low offer would set a precedent for future negotiations and weaken my position.
* **Explore potential for a better price:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price.  Bob's offer shows he's interested in buying, giving me leverage.
* **Avoid settling too low:** Selling to John would guarantee my minimum price, but I'm aiming for a higher profit.

I'm confident that by strategically negotiating, I can potentially reach a price that's more beneficial to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

My counteroffer reflects a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. 

* **Reasoning:**  
    * My previous offer was too high, prompting Bob's lower counteroffer.  
    * This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum value.
    * By decreasing my price by $150,000, I'm showing flexibility and signaling my desire to reach an agreement.

* **Strategic Considerations:**  
    * This offer maintains a significant margin above Bob's offer, indicating my willingness to negotiate but not settle for a drastically lower price.
    * It gives Bob a reasonable price point to consider, potentially leading to a successful negotiation.

I'm confident this counteroffer will encourage further negotiation with Bob and lead to a mutually acceptable agreement, maximizing my profit while staying true to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's latest offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm committed to negotiation, I've reached a point where it's no longer a good use of my time.  I've made concessions, but Bob's counteroffers remain far below my minimum. 

It's time to secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John.  This decision is based on:

* **Guaranteed profit:** John offers a price that meets my minimum requirement and ensures a substantial profit. 
* **Time factor:**  Continuing negotiation with Bob risks further lowering my price and delaying the sale.
* **Lack of progress:** Bob's offers have not shown a willingness to meet my requirements.

By selling to John, I'm maximizing my profit and minimizing the risk of a further reduction in price.  While I was hopeful to negotiate with Bob, his offers were not aligned with my goals.  This decision allows me to move on and secure a favorable outcome."
