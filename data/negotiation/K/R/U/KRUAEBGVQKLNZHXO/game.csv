"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price of $180. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $165? I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $165 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $140.  I'm serious about wanting to buy this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $155? I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit on this sale.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $140. This is a fair price, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking with $140, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go down to $150, which is the minimum I can accept. If you're serious about buying this product, I'd be willing to meet you at this price. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $150 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Let's split the difference and go with $145. I'm confident this will work for both of us.",145.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $145. I'm still holding firm at $150. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the sale. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",150.0,Alice,9,
