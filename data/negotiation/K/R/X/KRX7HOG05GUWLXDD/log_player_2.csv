"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That way, we both get a fair deal.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $10,000, and it's closer to Bob's desired price of $8,000.  Accepting the offer ensures a successful purchase at a reasonable cost."
