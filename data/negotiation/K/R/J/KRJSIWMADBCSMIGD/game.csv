"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1400000 is a bit above what I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer $1100000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1100000 is significantly lower than my desired price. I'm open to finding a middle ground. Let's go with $1250000. This allows for some flexibility on both sides. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1250000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $1150000 is still below my minimum expectation. I'm willing to go down to $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's close the deal at this point.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
