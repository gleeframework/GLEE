"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $11000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $9500. I think that's a fair price, considering the product's value to me is around $10000.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $12000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $9800, but no higher. I think that's a fair price, considering the product's value to me is around $10000.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9800. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product to you for $10200. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to me is $12000. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9800, that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000.",9800.0,Bob,6,
