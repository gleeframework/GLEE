"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for potential negotiation and still leaves room for me to lower the price if necessary. It's important to remember that I have a minimum value of $12,000 in mind, so I'm not willing to go below that. I'll be observing Bob's response closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy for subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to see if I can negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering $13,000. This is still above my minimum value and represents a compromise from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price that might entice Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $12,000.  However, it's getting closer.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is a significant compromise on my part, as it's just $500 above my minimum value. However, given Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price, I think this offer has a good chance of being accepted.  If he rejects it, I'm prepared to consider selling to John in the next round."
