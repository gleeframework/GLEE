Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $8,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000. It makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from John at the price you know you can get."
