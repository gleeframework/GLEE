"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is more than what the product is worth to Bob but still less than my minimum price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport with Bob and make him feel like I'm trying to work with him.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, making him more likely to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can get the product for less elsewhere. I am willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Better Deal:** While $9,000 is a decent amount, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  
* **More Rounds to Negotiate:** I have nine rounds left to negotiate with Bob. This gives me time to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John is always an option, but it's not the most profitable choice right now. I want to see if I can push Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  I've shown flexibility by lowering my price, demonstrating I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Final Offer:** I'm presenting this as my final offer to put pressure on Bob. It's a clear signal that I'm serious about this price.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $9,500 is still above my minimum price of $12,000, giving me a good profit margin.
* **Time is Ticking:**  The number of rounds is limited, so I need to start closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $9,200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While $9,200 is closer to my minimum price, I still have time to negotiate and push for a slightly higher amount. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe I can still convince Bob to come up a bit more. 
* **Time is Not Running Out:**  We're still early in the negotiation process with 6 rounds left.
* **John's Offer:** I'm still holding out hope for a better deal with Bob, so I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,200 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,350? This way we both get a fair deal, and I can move the product quickly."", ""product_price"": 9350}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to find a middle ground. 
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency by mentioning that I can move the product quickly. This encourages Bob to make a decision.
* **Small Increment:**  The increase to $9,350 is relatively small, making it less likely that Bob will reject the offer outright. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** I'm staying above my minimum price of $12,000, ensuring I still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see that you're willing to meet somewhere in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to consider $9,300 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Target:**  $9,300 is very close to my previous offer of $9,350. It's also significantly higher than Bob's initial offer of $9,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are in round 6, and I only have 4 rounds left. There's a risk that if I continue to reject offers, Bob will walk away. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is still on the table, it's a higher amount, and it seems unlikely that I'll be able to get significantly closer to that with Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of rejecting and getting a lower counteroffer from Bob is greater than the reward of potentially getting a slightly higher price. It's time to secure the deal."
