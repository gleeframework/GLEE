"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you:**  You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $120. This means you'll save $30 compared to buying from John.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer is not beneficial:**  Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll have to buy from John at a higher price."
