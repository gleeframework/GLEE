Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still getting a profit and covers your minimum value.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? How about $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to get a bit more than $100 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about $110? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
