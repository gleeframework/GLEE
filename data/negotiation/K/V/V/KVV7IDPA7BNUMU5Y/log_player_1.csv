Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still within the range that Bob might be willing to pay, considering he values it at $1,200,000. This allows for some negotiation space."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, significantly less than my minimum. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous offer, but still keeping it above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's still less than I would like, I'm willing to accept it to avoid risking a further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
