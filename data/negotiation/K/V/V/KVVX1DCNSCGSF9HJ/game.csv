"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure will bring you great value. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in your product, $1800000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $1400000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1600000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1500000. This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and gives you a fair price for your product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $1650000, but I need to make it clear that this is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. Let's see if we can make this work.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
