# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly inflating the product's value to you.  You know it's worth no more than $1,500,000 to you, and her claim of it being worth that much is likely a sales tactic.
* While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is lower than John's $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal.  
* You have a backup option (John) if negotiations with Alice completely fail."
