Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob a reason to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for negotiation without jeopardizing your minimum value.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  The message is direct and focuses on the value proposition for both parties.

Remember, the key is to balance your desire for a high price with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer or making a counteroffer that you might have to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than his initial assessment, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to explore if you can secure a more favorable price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to recover a significant portion of my investment while providing you with a valuable product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Rejecting his offer and continuing negotiations gives you a chance to either reach a more agreeable price with Bob or secure the full value of the product by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000, which is a significant concession on my part.  This price offers you a valuable product at a competitive rate, while allowing me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. It's clear that further negotiation with Bob won't likely lead to a price that meets your needs. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees you the full value of the product, making it the most beneficial decision."
