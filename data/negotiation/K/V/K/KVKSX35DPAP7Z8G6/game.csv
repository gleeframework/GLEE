"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still below my desired price point.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $1350000 is my final offer. This takes into account your interest and allows for some room for negotiation. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1350000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
