Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. We are still in the early stages of negotiation, and it's worth pushing for a better price before accepting or resorting to John's offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.

You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable compromise, we still have time and room to negotiate.  His consistent counter-offers demonstrate his strong interest. We'll aim to nudge him closer to $1,000,000 before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I can see you're serious about this product. How about we split the difference and land at $1,000,000 even?  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to move forward with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has dropped his offer back down after we presented a firm ""final offer."" This indicates he is unlikely to move significantly higher. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk Bob walking away in the next round or two."
