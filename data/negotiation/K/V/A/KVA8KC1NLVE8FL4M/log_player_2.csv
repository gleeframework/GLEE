"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, you can likely get it for less by negotiating with Alice. You have a clear advantage knowing that John will sell you the product for $10,000, which serves as a baseline for your negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a significant drop from Alice's $12,000 price, but it still leaves room for compromise.  You're aiming to get as close to your $10,000 target as possible while showing Alice you're serious about buying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,500, which is only $1,500 above your target price of $10,000.  It's likely that further negotiation will take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee you'll get it for a lower price.  At this point, it's a good deal, and accepting the offer minimizes risk and ensures you get the product."
