"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $8000. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better price. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $7500. How about we try $8200? It's still a bit above your initial offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $8200 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think I can do $7800. Can you consider that?",7800.0,Bob,6,
