"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason: While $110 is lower than John's price, it's still significantly higher than Alice's valuation. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By offering $90, we're aiming for a price significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is framed politely to maintain a good negotiating atmosphere. We're also providing a reason for the counteroffer, making it seem more reasonable.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation. It allows us to gauge Alice's willingness to lower the price and provides a basis for finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! However, $90 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I can do $100, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $100 is a good price, saving us $20 compared to John's offer and representing a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.
* **Alice's Limit:** Alice has indicated that $100 is her lowest price. Pushing further might make her less willing to negotiate or even lead to her ending the negotiation.
* **Time Savings:** Accepting the offer now avoids further back-and-forth, saving time and potential hassle."
