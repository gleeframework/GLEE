Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I want to try and push for a higher price and see if I can negotiate a better deal before resorting to selling to John."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers, so I'll offer $1,350,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm hoping to see if I can push him a bit further in the next round. If he won't budge, I'm prepared to sell to John."
