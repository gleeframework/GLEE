"Alice,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $11,000.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $12,500. That way we both get a good deal. What do you say?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $14,000? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's the best I can do.",14000.0,Alice,5,
