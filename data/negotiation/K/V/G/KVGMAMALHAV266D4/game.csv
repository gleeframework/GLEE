"I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell the product for $1,600,000.  This leaves room for both of us to walk away with a solid deal.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we settle on $1,100,000? I think this is a fair price considering the market value. Can you consider my offer?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $1,100,000 is just too low for me. Let's try $1,400,000. It's a good price for both of us, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's close this deal!",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's the maximum I can offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the price I'm willing to pay. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence, but we need to find a price that works for both of us. Let's compromise and meet at $1,300,000. This is my final offer. If you're serious about buying the product, let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that $1,300,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's the absolute maximum I can offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the price I'm willing to pay. Can you reconsider your final offer?",1250000.0,Bob,8,
