"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and maintain a positive tone.** 
* **Express interest in the product.**
* **Clearly state that the initial price is too high.**
* **Propose a significantly lower price ($70) to provide room for negotiation.**  This starting point is closer to Alice's value ($80) while still leaving us space to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a living too. I can do $82.50, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but we can still try to improve our position slightly. We're getting close to the point where John's offer might be our best bet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $76?"",
 ""product_price"": 76
}
```

Here's the strategy behind this counteroffer:

* **Acknowledge Alice's compromise:** We want to maintain a positive negotiating environment.
* **Propose a specific solution:** ""Splitting the difference"" is a common tactic that seems fair to both sides. 
* **Move closer to our limit:**  This offer keeps us below John's $100 but recognizes that we might need to concede a bit more to avoid losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $84. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $84
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems we've reached an impasse with Alice. She's no longer moving towards a reasonable compromise. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll get a price significantly better than John's $100 offer.  It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed deal."
