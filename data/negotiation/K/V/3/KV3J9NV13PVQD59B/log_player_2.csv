# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000, which is the lowest price I can offer. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can discuss the details. If not, I have another buyer lined up who's also interested, and I'll need to move forward with them. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as buying from John.  Since your goal is to save money, there's no advantage to buying from Alice.  Rejecting her offer means you'll have the option to try to negotiate a lower price with John or explore other options."
