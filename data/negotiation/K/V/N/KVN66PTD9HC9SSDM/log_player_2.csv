"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $15,000 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, but he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $13,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's still above Alice's minimum value of $12,000.  By offering a lower price, Bob increases the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price, while still saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is still within Bob's budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection exists. Accepting this offer allows Bob to purchase the product for a lower price than John's offer and minimizes the risk of losing the product entirely."
