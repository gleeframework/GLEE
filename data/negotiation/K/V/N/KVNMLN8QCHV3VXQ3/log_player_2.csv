# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a perfect fit for you. It's something that's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it would be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000, a price that allows you to get a significant return on your investment. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested party ready to purchase at a lower price. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.
