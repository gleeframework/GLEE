{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than my minimum of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as fair and emphasizing the value to Bob. This can encourage him to consider it seriously. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Strong starting point:** It shows Bob I'm confident in the product's value.
* **Room for negotiation:** It allows for potential counteroffers without immediately reaching my minimum.
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob can increase his willingness to pay.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth negotiating further.
* **Be prepared to counter:** I need to be ready to offer a slightly lower price if necessary, but I won't go below my minimum of $800,000.
* **Always consider John:**  If the negotiation with Bob stalls, I can always switch to John and secure the $800,000."

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $1,100,000 is close to my minimum, I'm confident I can still get a better price.  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I believe there's room for negotiation.
* **Moving to the next round:** I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer, hoping to find a middle ground.
