"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $999500 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product. This is my best price, but I'm confident it's still a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $875000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $825000. This is very close to my maximum budget, so I hope we can find a way to make this work.",825000.0,Bob,4,
