"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $1,150,000 to start the conversation.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer acknowledges that we are looking for a mutually beneficial deal and invites Bob to engage in the discussion. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer helps me gauge Bob's level of interest and flexibility. His response will guide my strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to find a deal that works for both of us, accepting such a low offer would mean a substantial loss for me. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. I could consider $1,100,000. This offer reflects my desire to reach a deal while acknowledging the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** I've reduced my asking price by $50,000, indicating I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm:** However, the new offer is still substantially above Bob's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about obtaining a fair price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, I'm reminding Bob of the benefits and justifying my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still under my $1,200,000 walk-away point. While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to the middle ground, I believe there's still room for him to increase his offer. I'm willing to counter-offer again to see if we can bridge the gap, but I'm keeping John in mind as a reliable alternative if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle on $1,075,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1075000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** By suggesting a price directly in the middle of our previous offers, I'm demonstrating a strong desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Time Constraint:**  As we are now past the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, I need to guide the deal towards a close, one way or another.
* **Maintaining Profitability:** This offer still ensures I make a significant profit above my minimum, even if it's slightly less than my initial goal. 
* **Urgency:** This offer, presented without further justification, might encourage Bob to make a decision soon, preventing the negotiation from dragging on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but no higher. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered $1,050,000 twice, indicating he is unlikely to move significantly higher. While this is a decent offer, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000.  

* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him not increasing his offer, potentially leading to a worse deal or no deal at all. This costs me time and potential profit.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees I receive my desired amount with no further negotiation or risk.
* **Business Decision:** It makes more financial sense to accept the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than to hope for a better outcome with Bob."
