"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation, and it's better to try and get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a great deal on a product you value. Let's find a compromise we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $950,000 is still above your budget. You're getting closer to a deal, but there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get closer to your goal of $800,000."
