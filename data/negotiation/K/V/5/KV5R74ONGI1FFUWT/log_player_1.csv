Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price allows for potential counteroffers without immediately reaching my minimum value ($1,200,000).
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I can continue negotiating or simply sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $850000.  Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob or by selling to John.  
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:**  The potential upside of a successful counteroffer outweighs the risk of continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a great deal on a product you value. Let's find a compromise we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value.
* **Maintain Profit Margin:** The $950,000 price allows me to earn a considerable amount while still offering a good deal to Bob.
* **Positive Framing:** The message again emphasizes the value of the product and seeks a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Urgency:** I'm not giving Bob much room to negotiate further, aiming to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting close to my minimum price of $1,200,000. 
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing the negotiation might lead to more rejections and potentially waste time.  There's no guarantee that I can secure a higher price, and John is still a viable option.
* **Good Deal:**  While $900,000 isn't my ideal outcome, it's still a significant profit and a reasonable compromise."
