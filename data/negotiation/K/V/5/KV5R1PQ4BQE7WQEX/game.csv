"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $12000? I'm genuinely interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to be honest with you, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $14000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $13000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $13000. How about we meet at $13500? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's a compromise that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
