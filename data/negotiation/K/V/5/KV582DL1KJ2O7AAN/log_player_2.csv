Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his target price. He should continue to try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's final offer is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $8,000.  It's better to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
