{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is asking for $200. This is way too high. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget, but $200 is my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's a fantastic product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$175 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100, and I'm not going to go much higher. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my offer of $100. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a tighter budget.  Let's make this work. How about $160? That's my final offer, and I think it's very fair for the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $160 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to stick with my counteroffer of $100 and see if Alice is willing to budge.  If not, I'll just buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still only able to pay $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that you'll get a good deal.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it."", ""product_price"": 100}
