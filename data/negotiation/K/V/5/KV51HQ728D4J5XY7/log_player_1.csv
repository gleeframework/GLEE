"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than nothing, it is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $14,000 is tempting,  I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about $16,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for at least $15,000. I have a few more rounds to negotiate, and I don't want to settle for less than the product's worth."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $14,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we could finalize the transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $15500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $14000, which is the lowest I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  I've only got a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. It's not the best outcome, but it's the most secure way to guarantee my minimum price."
