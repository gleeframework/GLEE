It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. Even if we fail, we can still buy from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $90 is a bit high for me.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product but I have a budget I need to stick to."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 90 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we compromise at 87.50? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is very close to my maximum price of $87.5.  It's better to accept and save some money compared to buying from John."
