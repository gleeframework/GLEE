"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but the price is a little too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer, but still reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $725,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to your target, Bob, but I'm still a bit away from meeting your offer. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product for you, but I need to stick to my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $787,500?",787500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $787,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000. Let's see if we can get as close as possible to your target.",825000.0,Alice,7,
