"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the maximum I can go for.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,850?",8850.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,850 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $8,500 is close, but I need to get a bit more out of this deal. Would you consider $8,675? It's a small compromise for a product we both know is valuable.",8675.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $8,675 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $8,500, so how about we try $8,625?",8625.0,Bob,6,
