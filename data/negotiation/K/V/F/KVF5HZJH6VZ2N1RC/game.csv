"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great investment for you. I'm confident you'll find this price fair, given the product's value and the potential returns it offers.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product is truly unique, and its value is much higher than that. I'm willing to come down a bit, and I'm offering you $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident that this price will be attractive to you and allows us to move forward with the sale.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that will generate significant returns.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a price that's closer to my minimum.  I'm offering $1,200,000. This is a final compromise, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a fair price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
