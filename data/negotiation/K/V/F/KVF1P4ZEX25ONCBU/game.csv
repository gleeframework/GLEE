"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand that's where you see the value, but I can't go quite that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $110 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $75?  That's a fair offer considering the price I have from another seller.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  That other seller's price doesn't surprise me, but I can do better.  My bottom line is $95.  What do you say?",95.0,Alice,5,
