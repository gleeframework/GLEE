"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $10000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of this product. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $8500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm placing on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
