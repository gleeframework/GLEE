This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, giving you room to negotiate. It also provides a clear reason for the price, hinting at the value Bob would gain. This approach aims to initiate a negotiation process that potentially leads to a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $950000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $810000, which is closer to the value I perceive the product to hold for me. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still lower than the value you perceive the product to hold. Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price. The next round will be a counteroffer, giving you more leverage to push for a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $810,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $840000. This price aligns more closely with what I am willing to pay while still reflecting the product's value to me. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $840,000 is just above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Given the potential for further negotiation to be lengthy and uncertain, accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a profit. It's also worth noting that further negotiation might not result in a significantly higher price, making this a reasonable decision to secure a sale."
