Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1300000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1375000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and it's a compromise on my end. Let's make this happen.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $1325000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1350000 one last time. This price is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and we've reached a stalemate.  I've already made significant concessions and there's no guarantee she'll accept my next counteroffer. It's more likely she'll stick to her price, or at least not go lower than $1,300,000. 

It's better to secure the product at a guaranteed price from John, who is willing to sell for $1,200,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and saves me further negotiation headaches."
