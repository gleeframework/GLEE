"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to us, we're looking to sell it for $12000. This is a special opportunity for you, considering its worth to you is $8000. Let's discuss if this offer aligns with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is my maximum limit. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your budget and the value you place on the product, I'm willing to adjust our offer to $9500. This is a middle ground between our previous offers and aims to ensure both parties are satisfied. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above my maximum budget. While it's closer, I'm still willing to try to negotiate a lower price.  It's worth seeing if we can reach a compromise before going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $9,500 is getting closer, it's still a bit above my budget. I'm still committed to $8,000, but I'm open to a slight increase to $8,500.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience and flexibility, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider an offer of $9000. This is the highest I can go while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin for us. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above my maximum budget, and I've already made it clear that I'm only willing to go up to $8,500.  At this point, with 5 rounds left, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. John's offer of $8,000 is the best option to stay within my budget."
