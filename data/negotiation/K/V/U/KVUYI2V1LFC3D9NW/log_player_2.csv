"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I think this is a great price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. There's a lot of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to establish a lower starting point for negotiation. It's still a significant margin from both Alice's asking price and my maximum budget, leaving room for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to her actual value, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll continue to counter-offer before accepting this price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,500. I think this is a fair price considering it's closer to the middle ground."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a lower price. It's a reasonable increment from my previous offer and positions the negotiation closer to a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,200. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This offer is getting very close to Alice's likely bottom line, and it's a good deal compared to John's $10,000 price. It's time to accept."
