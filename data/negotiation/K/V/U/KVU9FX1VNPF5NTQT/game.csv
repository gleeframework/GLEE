"Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's unfortunately outside my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm ready to offer $950,000.  I'm confident this price is reasonable and would allow us to finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
