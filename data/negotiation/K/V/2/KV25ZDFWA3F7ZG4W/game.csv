"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the market value of similar products, I'd be willing to pay $750000. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $750000. Considering your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is still a bit above my budget. However, I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the market value and my budget constraints. ",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $800000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll counteroffer at $825000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
