"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for getting back to me. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $10,750? That would be great.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your persistence. I understand that $10,750 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,900. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10900.0,Alice,5,
