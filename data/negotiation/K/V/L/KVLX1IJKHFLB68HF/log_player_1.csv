Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit but Stay Realistic:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. However, you need to offer a price that's enticing to him.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000  creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts:
    * You make a $150,000 profit over your guaranteed price.
    * Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its value to him. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal."
