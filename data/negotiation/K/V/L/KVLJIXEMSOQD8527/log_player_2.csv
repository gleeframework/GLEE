"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is a one-time offer, so don't miss out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a decent price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($120).  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $125 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering $135, which is still above her own value of $120.  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price. However, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. Would you be willing to accept $130?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $132.50. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $132.50 is still slightly above my ideal price, but it's a good deal considering I can get it for $150 from John. It's also closer to my previous counteroffer of $130.  Since it's her final offer, it's reasonable to accept and close the deal."
