"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $12,000 for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's best not to accept the first offer. Alice is starting quite high above your maximum price. There's room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's opening, giving you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message conveys your interest in the product while firmly establishing your budget limitations. 
* **Leaving Room:** This offer allows for a back-and-forth negotiation. Alice is likely to counter, giving you more information about her acceptable price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. My counteroffer for the product is $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, she's still closer to her starting point than yours. You're aiming for $10,000 or less, and she's only $500 away from that. There's a good chance you can negotiate further down, especially with several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we settle at $8,750?  That would work well for me."",
""product_price"": 8750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  This offer shows you're willing to negotiate but aren't going to drastically jump towards Alice's price. 
* **Specific Number:** Giving a precise number, rather than a range, can help anchor the negotiation and make it feel like you're closer to a deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintain a friendly and collaborative tone to encourage further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're finding my offer more manageable, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I think a fair compromise would be $9,250. This still allows us both to benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, which is a good sign. However, she's still above your target price. You have plenty of rounds left and the gap isn't huge. It's worth seeing if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm ready to make a deal, but I need to be at $9,000. If we can make that work, I'm ready to agree to the purchase today."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer is still below your absolute maximum but shows Alice you're serious about closing the deal. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning that you're ready to buy *today* adds a bit of pressure and implies that this is your best offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** You're getting closer to John's price, so you have less incentive to negotiate aggressively. This offer is a good balance between getting a deal and not risking the negotiation falling through."
