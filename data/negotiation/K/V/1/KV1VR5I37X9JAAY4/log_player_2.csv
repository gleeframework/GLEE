"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $120 by myself. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe it's worth more than $80 to you. Would you be interested in purchasing it at a special introductory price of $95? This is an exclusive offer just for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $95 is lower than her own valuation, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $80 and the price John offers ($80). You can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
