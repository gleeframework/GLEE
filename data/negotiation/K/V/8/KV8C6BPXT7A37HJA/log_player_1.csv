{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. Let me know your thoughts – this offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, it's always best to explore maximizing profit. Offering it to Bob first at a higher price allows for this possibility.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $950,000 is carefully chosen:
    * It's significantly less than John's offer, making it attractive to Bob.
    * It's still a substantial profit above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, giving him an incentive to negotiate. 
* **Time Constraint:** The 24-hour limit adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Ideal scenario – I secure the highest possible profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:** This opens the door for further discussion.  I can assess his counter-offer and decide if it's worthwhile to accept less than $1,000,000 or move on to John.
* **Bob Rejects:** I proceed with selling to John at the guaranteed $1,000,000."
