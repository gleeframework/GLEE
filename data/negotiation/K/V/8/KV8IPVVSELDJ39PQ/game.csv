"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to lower my price to $13,000 to make this deal work.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $13,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise. However, I need to stay above $12,000 to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,250, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think we can do better. How about we meet at $12,000? I'm willing to take the risk of buying from you directly, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
