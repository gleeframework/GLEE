"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the long-term value this product will bring.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
