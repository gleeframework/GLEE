Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is positive and focuses on the benefits for both of us.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm clearly inviting Bob to counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.
* If negotiations stall, I have the option to walk away and sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's so far below my desired value. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $9,000. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** I emphasize that this price is fair for both of us.
* **Urgency:** I subtly imply that we're close to a deal, encouraging Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a decent price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer.
* If negotiations stall again, I can still sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I've already made concessions and it seems Bob is unwilling to budge further. At this point, it's better to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John.  The risk of further negotiation with Bob is too high, as he may continue to push for a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

I will contact John and finalize the sale for $15,000."
