"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000, which reflects its true value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum price of $12,000, you know you can get a better deal from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can purchase the product for $12,000 from John and save $2,000."
