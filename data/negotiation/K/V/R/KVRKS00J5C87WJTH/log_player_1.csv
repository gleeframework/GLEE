"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. $9,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your offer, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

While $9,800 is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,800 is still too low. How about $10,200? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 10200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough spot. I want more than $9,500, but the negotiation is taking a lot of time and I'm only 5 rounds away from having to sell to John.  To avoid risking getting stuck with a lower price, I'm going to sell to John for $10,000. It's my minimum and I'm guaranteed the sale."
