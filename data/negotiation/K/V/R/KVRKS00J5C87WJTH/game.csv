,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your offer, $9000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",10500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9800 is still too low. How about $10200? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,
