"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The message aims to be positive and gauge Bob's initial reaction. His response will provide valuable information for future rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind that John's offer of $1,200,000 provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob stall or become unfavorable, there's always the option to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below my initial ask. I believe there's room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer and presenting a counteroffer keeps the door open for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  This counteroffer aims to find a compromise by meeting halfway between your initial offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,300,000).
* **Justification:**  Emphasizing the product's value reinforces the idea that the price is fair and well-considered.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  Continuing the negotiation keeps the dialogue open and allows for further exploration of options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to offer $1,325,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is a reasonable compromise. While it's not the initial $1,400,000, consider these factors: 

* **Profitable:** It's still a significant profit margin above your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a genuine interest in the product. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations longer carries the risk of Bob losing interest or finding alternatives. Accepting now secures the deal."
