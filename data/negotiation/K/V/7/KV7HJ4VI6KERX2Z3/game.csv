"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Could you consider a lower price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,300,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  Could you do $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a deal, but $1,150,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think about other interested parties, so I'd like to make a deal with you soon.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
