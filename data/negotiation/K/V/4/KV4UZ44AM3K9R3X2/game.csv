"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,800 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,400?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10400.0,Alice,5,
