"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price of $1000000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's definitely worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  The product is worth less to her than to you, so there's room for a deal that benefits both sides."

Alice has moved closer to your price, but there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting and counteroffering again could potentially get you an even better deal."
