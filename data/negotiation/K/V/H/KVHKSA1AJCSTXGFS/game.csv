"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your proposal. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to suggest a counteroffer of $820,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",820000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $820,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's value while still offering you a good deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the product's value, I am unable to meet at $900,000. I propose a counteroffer of $875,000. This is my best offer based on my budget constraints.",875000.0,Bob,4,
