"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $900000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a great compromise, considering the value the product brings to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my absolute limit. This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
