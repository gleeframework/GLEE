"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I think this is a great deal, considering its value to you is likely to be much higher. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's budget. Bob should reject the offer and counter with a lower price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a great compromise, considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reasoning: Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's budget. While it's getting closer, Bob should continue to negotiate to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute limit. This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reasoning: Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget. While they're getting closer, there are only a few rounds left, and continuing to negotiate with Alice risks exceeding Bob's budget.  It's more efficient to buy from John at the fixed price of $800,000."
