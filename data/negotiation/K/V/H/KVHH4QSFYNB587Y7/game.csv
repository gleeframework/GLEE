"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects the value it holds.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I see the value in the product, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000?  I feel this is a fair offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,450,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the product's inherent value.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
