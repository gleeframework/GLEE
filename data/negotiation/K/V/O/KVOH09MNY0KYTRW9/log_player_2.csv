"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $850,000 is a bit low considering the value the product holds for you. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I'm asking for $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than John's price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There's room to bargain further, as Alice is already willing to compromise."
