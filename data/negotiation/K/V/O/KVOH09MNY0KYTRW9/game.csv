"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $850,000 is a bit low considering the value the product holds for you. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I'm asking for $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's make this happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,
