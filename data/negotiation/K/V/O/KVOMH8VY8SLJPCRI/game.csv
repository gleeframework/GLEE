"Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $14,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
