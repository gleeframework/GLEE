Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,500. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer. Even if he negotiates down, there's a good chance of settling above John's $8,000 offer.
* **Strong Opening:**  The message positions the product as valuable and implies there's competition (listing it publicly). This creates a sense of urgency and justifies the high price."
