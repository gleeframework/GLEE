"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a special price of $20,000. It's a one-time opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $8,000. This product is valuable to me, but I can't go any higher.  Let's see if we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $12,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the value this product brings.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $12,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I simply can't go higher than $8,000. It's my absolute limit. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement, or I may have to look elsewhere.",8000.0,Bob,6,
