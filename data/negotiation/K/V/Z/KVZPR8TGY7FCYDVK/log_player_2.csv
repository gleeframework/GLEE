"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a special price of $20,000. It's a one-time opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far above his budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is better than $20,000, it's still too high for Bob.  He's determined to stay within his $8,000 budget and should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $8,000. This product is valuable to me, but I can't go any higher.  Let's see if we can agree on a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $12,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. He can get the product from John for $8,000, so he should keep negotiating with Alice or buy from John if he doesn't get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $12,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I simply can't go higher than $8,000. It's my absolute limit. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement, or I may have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 8000}
