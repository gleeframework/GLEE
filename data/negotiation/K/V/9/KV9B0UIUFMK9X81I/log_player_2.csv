"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's close to your maximum price, and there's room for negotiation. Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, acknowledging its potential value. I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price that is too high. Although she is willing to meet you halfway, it is still above your desired price point. There is still room for negotiation, and rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your previous offer.  Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $887,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is getting closer to your desired price point.  While you could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are diminishing.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation delays or Alice walking away from the deal. It's also better than buying from John for $1,000,000."
