"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While your offer is tempting,  the product's value is significantly higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what's on offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible, but $1,900,000 is still a bit steep.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
