"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a unique and valuable item. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $750000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm happy to split the difference and offer $800000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's work towards a final agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that we're close to an agreement, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
