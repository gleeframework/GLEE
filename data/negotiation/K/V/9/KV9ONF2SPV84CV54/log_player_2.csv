{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but there's room for improvement. I'll reject the offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $750000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm happy to split the difference and offer $800,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that we're close to an agreement, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $825,000 is within my budget.  While I would prefer to get it for even lower, I don't want to risk losing the product.  The remaining rounds are valuable for negotiating with John, so accepting Alice's offer and securing the product is the best strategy at this point."
