This is the point to take the offer. Here's why:

* **Matching John's Offer:** Bob's offer now matches what John is willing to pay. There's no further financial incentive to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and gets you the money faster. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to push for a slightly higher price could frustrate Bob and risk losing the deal entirely.

By accepting Bob's $1,500,000 offer, you ensure a guaranteed sale at the best possible price you can currently achieve."
