"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  He's hoping to get a price closer to his ideal range without completely alienating Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While $11,000 is closer to his desired range, it's still higher than he wants to pay.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is proposing a compromise. He's increasing his offer, showing Alice he's serious about the deal, but still keeping it below Alice's latest offer. This is a strategic move to show flexibility and potentially secure a deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $11,250 for the product. This is a great deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking for a lower price. While Alice's offer is closer to his ideal price, he can still try to negotiate a bit lower. The risk of buying from John is still present, but Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to compromise. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get Alice to drop her price just a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $11,000? It's a good price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push for a lower price, meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and his previous counteroffer.  This is a strong negotiating tactic, demonstrating his commitment to reaching an agreement.  He is still within his budget and is hoping to close the deal before considering John's offer."
