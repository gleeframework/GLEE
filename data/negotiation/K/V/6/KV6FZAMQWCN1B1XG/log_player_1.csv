Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 starts the negotiation with a strong anchor price. While it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it leaves room for negotiation and is still below your guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message focuses on the ""unique value and potential"" of the product, subtly reminding Bob of its worth and encouraging him to see beyond his initial valuation. 
* **Exclusivity:**  Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" can create a sense of scarcity and desirability, potentially influencing Bob to act quickly.

**Outcome:**

This strategy aims to:

1. **Ideal Scenario:** Bob accepts the offer, and you secure a sale significantly above his perceived value and your reserve price.
2. **Negotiation:** Bob counter-offers, opening up a negotiation where you have room to lower the price slightly while still exceeding your $1,200,000 goal. 
3. **Backup:** If Bob outright rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your guaranteed price."
