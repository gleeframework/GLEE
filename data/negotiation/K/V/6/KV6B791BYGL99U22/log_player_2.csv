"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is too high.  You want to save as much money as possible and are willing to negotiate. It's better to reject the offer and see if you can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its worth to you, I believe $1,300,000 is a fair starting point for our negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $1,375,000 is still more than you are willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a lower price. There are still several rounds to go, so there's time to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,375,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to pay $1,350,000 for the product.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. How about we settle at $1,360,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and while it's still a bit higher than you initially wanted, it's getting closer to your desired price.  It's important to weigh the potential of continuing to negotiate against the risk of losing the deal altogether.  Since John is offering the product for $1,500,000, accepting Alice's offer at $1,360,000 will save you $140,000. It's a good compromise and a solid deal."
