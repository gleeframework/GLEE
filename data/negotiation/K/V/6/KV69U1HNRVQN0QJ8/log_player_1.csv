{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so Alice needs to offer a price lower than his valuation but high enough to maximize her profit.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't need to go below a certain price point.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning other interested parties, Alice creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept. 

This offer aims to find a balance point. If Bob negotiates, Alice has some room to lower the price slightly and still make a significant profit. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can confidently sell to John at her desired price."
