"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1000000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $900000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,5,
