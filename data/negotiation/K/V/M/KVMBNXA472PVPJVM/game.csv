"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $125. How about we try $115? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's still within my budget",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. $115 is still a bit lower than where I'm comfortable going. How about we compromise at $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $115, which is $118. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",118.0,Bob,6,
