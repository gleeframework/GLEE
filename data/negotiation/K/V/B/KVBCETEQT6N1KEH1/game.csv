,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1050000. This is my final offer for now.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1025000. This is my final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but I still think $1025000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $980000. Can you consider that?",980000.0,Bob,6,
