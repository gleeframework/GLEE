"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your needs perfectly. Given its high value and quality, we believe it's worth $100. Considering its worth to you, would you be interested in acquiring it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's message is enticing, there's no benefit to paying $100 to her when you can get it for the same price from John. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of her making a lower counter-offer, giving you a chance to save."
