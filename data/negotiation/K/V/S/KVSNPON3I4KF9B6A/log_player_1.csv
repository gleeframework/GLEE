Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's valuation of $80, but still allows for some profit for Alice. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, allowing Alice to see if Bob is interested in the product at a price closer to her desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than Alice's minimum desired price of $120.  By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice can try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $90 is still below Alice's minimum desired price of $120, it's getting closer to her desired range.  Considering the risk of Bob walking away or the possibility of further negotiations dragging on, accepting this offer is a reasonable choice.  It's a good compromise and secures a sale."
