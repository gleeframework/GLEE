Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's maximum valuation ($100). This leaves room for negotiation but ensures I don't leave too much money on the table. 
* **Justification:** While I don't explicitly mention the value to Bob, framing it as something ""valuable"" subtly suggests it's worth a significant amount to him.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $80, so I won't go below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum price ($80) and his own valuation ($100). Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $87? That's a significant discount from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've significantly reduced my price from $95 to $87, signaling a willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  This price point is closer to the middle of our initial offers, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Justification:** I'm framing the price reduction as a ""significant discount,"" highlighting the perceived value Bob would be getting.
* **Above Minimum:** Crucially, I'm still well above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and have room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but I'm still finding it a bit high.  Could you do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob increased his offer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'll try to steer him closer to $80 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to work towards a price that works for both of us, but I need to be closer to $80 to make it worthwhile. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm now holding firm at my minimum acceptable price of $80. This signals to Bob that I'm serious about this being my bottom line.
* **Justification:** By framing it as ""making it worthwhile,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have other options (selling to John), and this is a fair deal.
* **Simplified Choice:** Offering $80 directly simplifies the decision for Bob. He either accepts this final offer, or I walk away."
