Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your latest offer. I understand that $13,500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $15,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to me is $15,000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $12,000.  Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above his budget, and he only has a few rounds left.  It's better to secure the product at a price he's comfortable with than to risk losing it to Alice."
