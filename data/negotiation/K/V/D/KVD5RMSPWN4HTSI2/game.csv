"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $18,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your latest offer. I understand that $13,500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $15,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to me is $15,000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
