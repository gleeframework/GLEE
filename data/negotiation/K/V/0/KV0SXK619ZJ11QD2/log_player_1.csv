"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I want to keep the negotiation friendly and open to possibilities.
* **Testing the waters:**  This first offer will gauge Bob's interest and give me an idea of where to go next."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price. 
* **Protecting my value:**  Selling to John for $150 is an option, but I'm not in a rush. I want to see if I can close a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $105?  That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price closer to Bob's but still above my minimum.
* **Justifying the price:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to make my offer seem more reasonable.
* **Maintaining a friendly tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation positive to maintain a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still close to my minimum:** While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm not desperate for a sale. There's still a chance to get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I show him that I'm not willing to settle for anything less than a certain amount.
* **More rounds available:**  We're still early in the negotiation process, and I have more rounds to potentially reach a better agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm happy to work with you.  Let's split the difference. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it lets you get this great product without breaking the bank.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground price, again demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on value:** I remind Bob that the product is ""great"" to reiterate its worth.
* **Positive language:** I'm keeping the tone light and friendly, hoping to encourage a positive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:** We're halfway through the negotiation process, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but not quite there.
* **Risk of stalemating:** If I keep rejecting, there's a chance we'll reach a stalemate, and I'll lose out on a sale.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $150, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer.  

**It's time to take the sure thing.  I'll sell to John.**"
