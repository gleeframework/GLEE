Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you. To make this a swift deal, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can confidently aim higher with Bob.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and Bob's potential gain justifies the higher price.
* **Negotiation Room:** The $1,200,000 price tag leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit if Bob accepts.

This approach maximizes your potential earnings while keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
