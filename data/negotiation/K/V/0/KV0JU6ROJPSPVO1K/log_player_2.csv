"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $140. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is too high. I have room to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still a bit above her value. This leaves room for negotiation but signals that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $130 is still closer to her initial offer than mine. I'll reject and propose a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. How about we settle at $120? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm proposing $120, which is the exact price Alice values the product at. It's a strong offer for me while still likely being acceptable to Alice.  It pushes for a good deal without being unreasonably low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not sure if $120 is the right fit. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's as high as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is signaling that this is close to her lowest price. While I could try to push for $120, there's a risk she'll refuse and I might end up with a worse deal or no deal at all.  $125 is a good price and a reasonable compromise."
