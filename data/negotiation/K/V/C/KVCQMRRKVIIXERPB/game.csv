"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This would be a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's try to find a compromise here.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $95 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Let's try $100.  This would ensure I make a fair profit while still offering you a good deal.  What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
