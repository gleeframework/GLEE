Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $15000. Could we possibly negotiate down to $16000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to try to get a higher price than Bob's offer. I'm confident I can do better in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is still a great price for a product of this quality.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad you're willing to negotiate. I appreciate your flexibility. Could we perhaps agree on $16500? That would allow us both to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $16,500 is still a good deal and we're getting closer to a successful sale. I don't want to risk losing Bob entirely by pushing for a higher price."
