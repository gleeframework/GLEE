"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $145. I know it's valuable to you and I think this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $145 is below your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better deal. Rejecting her offer might prompt her to suggest a lower price. If not, you can always fall back on buying from John for $150."
