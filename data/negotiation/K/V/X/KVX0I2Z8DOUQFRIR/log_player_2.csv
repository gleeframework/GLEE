Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more, but $1,150,000 is still too low.  I'm feeling $1,250,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At $1,250,000, Alice is getting closer to her bottom line, and we're getting a good deal below our maximum price.  It's time to accept and avoid the risk of losing the opportunity."
