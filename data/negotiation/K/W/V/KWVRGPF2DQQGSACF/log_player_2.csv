"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon.  If you decline, I will be selling it to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. 
* While Alice mentions a limited-time offer and another buyer, you have a guaranteed option with John at a lower price.
* Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to proceed with purchasing from John and save $200,000."
