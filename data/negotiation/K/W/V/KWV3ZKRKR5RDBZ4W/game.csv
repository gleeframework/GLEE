"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,075,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000? This recognizes the product's value while still being a good deal for you.",1110000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit higher than $1,110,000. How about we meet at $1,090,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being a good deal for me.",1090000.0,Bob,4,
