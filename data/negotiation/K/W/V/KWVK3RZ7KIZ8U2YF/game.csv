"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $600,000 for the product. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product looks promising, but $600,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $400,000?",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $400,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a new price of $550,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $550,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land closer to $450,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",450000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm proposing a new price of $475,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",475000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close.  Would you be willing to settle at $460,000?  I think that's a fair compromise and would allow us to close this deal.",460000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $470,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",470000.0,Alice,7,
