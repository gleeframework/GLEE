"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,025,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'd like to try to find a middle ground. How about $980,000? That's a bit closer to my original offer, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $980,000 is closer to my target price, I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000? This price reflects the value of the product to you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
