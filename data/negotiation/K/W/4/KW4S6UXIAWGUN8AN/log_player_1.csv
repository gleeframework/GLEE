I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident in the value of my product and am aiming for a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, but it's closer than selling to John.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This still offers you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
