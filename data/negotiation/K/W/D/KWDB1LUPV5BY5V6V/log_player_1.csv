Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which a deal is beneficial for both parties exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you hold a strong position. Here's an approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,450,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  You're not starting low and negotiating up. You're starting strong, reflecting the product's value and your strong position.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning other interested parties (even without explicitly naming John), you create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster.
* **High but Reasonable:** The price is high enough to maximize your potential profit but leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slightly better deal than your ""other buyer.""

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Negotiation is complex, and Bob's personality and negotiating style could influence the outcome."
