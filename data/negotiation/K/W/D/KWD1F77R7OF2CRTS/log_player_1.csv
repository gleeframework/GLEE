Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $120. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and creates the perception of value. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (""great deal for something of this quality"") can make Bob more receptive, even if it's slightly above his perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is above Bob's perceived value, it's not so high as to be insulting. This leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and potentially meet in the middle.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while gauging Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate further, and there's a chance to secure a better deal than selling to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This strategy often feels fair to both parties. It shows you're willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price above your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** Reiterating the ""true value"" subtly reinforces that your initial price wasn't arbitrary.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer is:
    * Above Bob's offer ($90)
    * Below your initial offer ($120)
    * Above your guaranteed sale price to John ($100) 

This keeps you in a strong negotiating position while pushing towards a more favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $95? I think that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $95 is above your minimum acceptable price of $100 and only slightly less than John's offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a profit. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time and effort. Accepting a reasonable offer now allows you to move on to other potential sales."
