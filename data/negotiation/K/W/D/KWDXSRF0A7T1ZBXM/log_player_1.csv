Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum. 
* **Justify the Price:**  Mentioning ""value"" and ""interest"" creates a sense of demand and justifies a price higher than Bob's perceived value.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob counters, but don't go below $15,000 as you have a guaranteed sale at that price."
