{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring if I can get a better price from Alice. I'll reject the offer and counter with a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to buy it for $7,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While I understand your price point, $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $8500.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it's still a great value for you. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
