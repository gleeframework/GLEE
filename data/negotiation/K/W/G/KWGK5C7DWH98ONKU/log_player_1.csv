"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate and creates the perception of value.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how interested Bob is in the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:** I always have the option to sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed price, I started high for a reason. There's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, which can encourage him to do the same.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still significantly above both his offer and my minimum, reinforcing the product's value. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me understand how much negotiating power I have and if a deal above $12,000 is achievable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $13,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $13,500 is a significant profit above my minimum of $12,000.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob has consistently shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer demonstrates his commitment to finding a compromise.
* **Time Value:**  While I could potentially negotiate for a bit more, there's always the risk that Bob walks away or the negotiations stall. Accepting now secures a good deal."
