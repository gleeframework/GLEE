"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. Rejecting and proposing a counter-offer allows you to negotiate for a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $500,000?"",
""product_price"": 500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($500,000), we aim to gauge Alice's flexibility and establish a negotiation range. This leaves room for upward movement while staying well below our $800,000 walk-away point. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is courteous and acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating our price target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $500,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $900,000? This price still allows me to make a profit, and it's closer to your initial budget. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is now getting closer to your budget, but you're still above what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your flexibility.  To be honest, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $700,000?  That would work much better for my budget."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** By suggesting $700,000, we're meeting Alice halfway between her current offer ($900,000) and our previous counteroffer ($500,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a more favorable price.
* **Honesty and Budget:** We reiterate that the price is a key factor and that $700,000 aligns better with our budget. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive and appreciative of Alice's efforts to find a solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $800,000, it makes more financial sense to take that deal. You've successfully negotiated Alice down, but John's offer is ultimately the better value."
