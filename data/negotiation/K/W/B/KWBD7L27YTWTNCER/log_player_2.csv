{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are looking to save as much money as possible. While $85 is a good deal, you can potentially get it for even cheaper.  By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $85 is close to your maximum of $100.  A counteroffer of $75 is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation. It is a significant discount from her original price, but still leaves room for a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is closer to your maximum of $100, but still leaves room for further negotiation. You can try to get a better price by rejecting the offer and counteroffering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your target price, but it's still higher than you'd like to pay.  A counteroffer of $80 represents a compromise, showing you're serious about buying but are still looking for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is only $5 more than what you're willing to pay from John.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's a risk that you'll run out of rounds or Alice will become unwilling to negotiate further.  It's best to accept this offer to avoid the risk of losing the product altogether."
