{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate if he counters, and I still have the option of selling to John for $120 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell it for that low. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's still a great price for a product you'll love!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is closer to my minimum, I still have the option of selling to John for $120. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $110 just isn't working for me.  How about we split the difference at $115? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $112.50.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $112.5 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite enough.  I'd rather sell to John for $120, which is a safer bet. I've already been through multiple rounds of negotiations, and it seems like Bob isn't willing to go higher.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed sale."
