"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $100 is quite a bit below its value. Could you meet me halfway at $175?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I can't go as low as $120.  My absolute lowest is $145.  I think that's a very reasonable offer considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and getting the product for $145 is a decent deal compared to John's $150 price."
