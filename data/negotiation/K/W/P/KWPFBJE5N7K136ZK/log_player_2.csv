Round 3

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000.

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point of $800,000.  I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get a better price with a counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, appreciate the compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's work towards a deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 825000}

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a lower price with a counteroffer.  I'm also considering the fact that I can always buy from John for $800,000 if this negotiation doesn't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm open to finalizing a deal, but $835,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $810,000.

Alice's offer is still above my target price, and I'm running out of rounds. If I reject this offer, I only have 3 rounds left, and there's no guarantee she will come down further.  It's safer to buy from John for $800,000 and secure the product."
