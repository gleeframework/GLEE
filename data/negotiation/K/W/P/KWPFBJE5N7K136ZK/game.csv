"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, appreciate the compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's work towards a deal at this point.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $835,000. I believe the product's value justifies this price, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle at this point. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",835000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm open to finalizing a deal, but $835,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $810,000. This would be a fair compromise, considering we're both close to our target price.  I'm confident this offer will make both of us happy. Let's make this happen.",810000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm not willing to go below $820,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time.",820000.0,Alice,7,
