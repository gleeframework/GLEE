Round 3

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $900,000, but I'm afraid I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. I think this price reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

This negotiation is going nowhere.  Alice is now increasing her price, not decreasing!  It's time to cut our losses and buy from John for $1,500,000 even though it's above our desired price."
