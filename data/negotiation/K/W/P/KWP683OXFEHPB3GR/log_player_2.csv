"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still not the best possible deal. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. Offering $950,000 is a considerable discount and might incentivize Alice to negotiate further. This is a starting point for negotiation, and Bob is ready to adjust the price depending on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $1,050,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's offer of $1,200,000 and closer to Bob's desired price range. While there's always a chance for a lower price, accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing the product to another buyer and saves a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
