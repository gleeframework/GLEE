"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price that's close to the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value, hoping to entice him to accept quickly.  However, if he rejects, I'm prepared to counter and potentially go lower to secure the deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round to try and push for a price closer to $1,450,000.  I want to see if I can close the gap without having to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1425000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but only by a small amount. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still confident in the value of the product. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and counter again in the next round, hoping to close the deal before having to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1390000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly again to show Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to the middle ground. With only five rounds left, I need to find a price that will satisfy Bob while still ensuring I get a good return on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,370,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,370,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, with only four rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob and having to sell to John is becoming significant. While I'd prefer to get a bit more, I'm confident that $1,370,000 is a good price, exceeding my minimum.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
