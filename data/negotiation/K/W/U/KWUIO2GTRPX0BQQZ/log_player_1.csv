Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $7,000. How about $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is holding firm below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll move significantly closer to $8,000. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
