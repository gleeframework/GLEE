"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $140? I'm really interested in the product and I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  $140 is a little too low for me though. How about $155? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to go up to $150. That's my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to go with John's offer.",150.0,Bob,4,
