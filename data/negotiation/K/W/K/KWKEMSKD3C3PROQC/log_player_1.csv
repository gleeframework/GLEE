"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture a large portion of the value Bob places on the product. I'm confident this offer is still attractive enough for him to consider, but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still too low for me. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,300,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price point that's closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a significant improvement from his previous offer and is getting closer to my initial price point.  With only a few rounds left, it's important to secure a sale and avoid the risk of losing a deal altogether."
