"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but I'm unfortunately unable to meet that price point. Given my budget, I'm prepared to offer $1250000 for the product. This price aligns with my maximum spending limit while still offering you a significant return on your investment.  I hope this counteroffer is agreeable to you.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1300000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1275000 for the product.  This represents a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you to recoup a significant portion of your investment while enabling me to stay within my financial constraints.  I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement at this price.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
