"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still gives you a significant profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1,075,000? That's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my target, but I'm still a bit off. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000 again, but I'll throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. Can you consider this price?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
