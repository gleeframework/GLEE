"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with my desired price, hoping to get the most value out of the sale. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price.  I'll counteroffer to try and reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm trying to find a price that's fair to both of us. $120 is still above my minimum, and it's a considerable drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility. Hopefully, Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, although it's closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'll need to be careful not to drop too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $90 is still too far off for me. I'm willing to go down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground while staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to compromise and close the deal. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we try $95?  That's a significant step from my last offer, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling below $100. There are still rounds left, and I want to see if we can find a better price. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $95 is still a little low for me, but I'm getting closer.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's getting us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 102.5} 
```

I'm offering a slight compromise to try and close the deal. This price is just above my minimum and might be appealing to Bob as it reflects a willingness to meet halfway. If he rejects, I might have to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $102.50 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could you do $97.50?  That would make it possible for me to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating, we're down to the last few rounds. Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. It's better to sell to John for $150 to ensure I get the best price possible."
