,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $90 is still too far off for me. I'm willing to go down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we try $95?  That's a significant step from my last offer, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, $95 is still a little low for me, but I'm getting closer.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's getting us closer to a deal.",102.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $102.50 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could you do $97.50?  That would make it possible for me to make this work.",97.5,Bob,8,
