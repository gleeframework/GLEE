"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and high demand, I'm asking for $20,000.  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far above his maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if a better price can be reached."

Round 2

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than her initial offer, it's still above his desired price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a mutually agreeable price can be reached."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $17,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
