"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is still a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,800. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
