Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room for negotiation and hopefully sets a good starting point. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation, which might make Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to compromise. I'm happy to sell it to you for $9,500. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my desired $10,000, Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting very close. It's also likely that further negotiation will lead to more concessions from both sides, potentially dragging the process out. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and relatively profitable sale, which is important given the risk of John potentially changing his mind."
