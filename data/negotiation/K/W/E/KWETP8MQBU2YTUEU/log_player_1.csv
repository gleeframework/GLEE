Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $150 is comfortably above your minimum of $120, giving you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A higher price might scare Bob away, so starting with a reasonable but profitable price is a good strategy.
* **It's friendly:** A positive message sets a good tone for the negotiation and encourages Bob to consider your offer. 

Remember, this is just the first offer. You'll need to adapt your strategy based on Bob's responses and your desire to maximize your earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than your minimum of $120.  While you could accept and sell the product, it would be a significant loss for you.  It's better to reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a great deal for you, and it's still a fair price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good strategy:

* **Compromise:** It shows you're willing to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price for yourself.
* **Reasoning:** Providing a reason for the price (fair for both parties) strengthens your position.
* **Positive tone:** A friendly message keeps the negotiation open and encourages Bob to come to an agreement.

Remember, the goal is to find a price that both you and Bob are comfortable with. This counteroffer is a step in that direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $110 is still below your minimum of $120. While it's closer, it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation.  You're better off selling to John for $120 and ensuring you make at least your minimum profit."
