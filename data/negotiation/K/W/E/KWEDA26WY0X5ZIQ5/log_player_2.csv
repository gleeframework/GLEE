"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum, there's still room for negotiation. It's always worth trying to get a better price, especially since you have an alternative option (John) at $1,000,000. By rejecting the offer, you can explore a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm aiming to get a better price for this product. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's price, demonstrating a desire to negotiate. However, it's still above Alice's minimum selling price, leaving room for her to make a counteroffer.
* **Show Interest:** The message expresses appreciation for Alice's offer, showing that you're interested in the product but seeking a better deal.
* **Building on Value:**  The counteroffer is based on your own assessment of the product's value to you, showcasing your understanding of the market."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice has moved significantly closer to your desired price, and $925,000 is a reasonable compromise. 
* **Saving Money:** You're still saving $75,000 compared to buying from John, which is a substantial amount.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your counteroffer and you'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer provides a good balance between getting a lower price and minimizing the risk of ending up with a worse deal."
