"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm aiming to get a better price for this product. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,
