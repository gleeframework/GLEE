"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10250? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $10250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers - how about $10375? This price represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",10375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,6,
