"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great price considering the value it holds. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which reflects a fair compromise. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,200,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down just a bit further to $1,225,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,175,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",1175000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're pushing your limits. However, $1,175,000 is still significantly below the product's value and my minimum requirements.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000 for a final compromise. This is a fair price, and I hope we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I've already made it clear that $1,175,000 is my maximum offer. I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm hoping you can accept this price, as it's a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1175000.0,Bob,8,
