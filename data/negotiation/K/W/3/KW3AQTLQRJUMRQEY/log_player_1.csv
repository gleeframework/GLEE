Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I can only commit to a maximum of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's worth holding out for a higher price. I'm confident I can secure a better deal by making a counteroffer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $980,000 for your product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us both. Looking forward to your thoughts!

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is more than Bob's current offer. It's time to take the secure deal."
