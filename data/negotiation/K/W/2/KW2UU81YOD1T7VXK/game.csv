"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would still allow you a good profit margin, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in between.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm feeling the pressure to close this deal, but I can't go any lower than $12,500. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it's the absolute lowest I can go. Let's finalize this and make it a win-win. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12,250. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,6,
