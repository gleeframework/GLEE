"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 13000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge his interest while maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I'll counteroffer and try to push for a higher price.  I'm not giving up yet!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is still a significant discount from my desired price, but it's a compromise that shows I'm willing to work with Bob. It's also closer to my minimum goal of $15,000, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I want to keep trying to negotiate a better price with Bob, and I think I can push him a bit further.  It's still too early to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $10,500.  This is a small compromise from my last offer but still above Bob's current offer. I'm trying to find that middle ground where we can both agree.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I want to keep the momentum going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,250 is tempting, it's still not meeting my minimum desired price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm going to see if I can push Bob a bit further. I have time on my side, and I want to make sure I get the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10350} 
```

I'm offering $10,350.  This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it shows I'm willing to meet him halfway.  We're getting close to a deal, and I'm hoping this will be enough to close the sale.  It's still too early to sell to John, and I believe I can get a better price with Bob."
