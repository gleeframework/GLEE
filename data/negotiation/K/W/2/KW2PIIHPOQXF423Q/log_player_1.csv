{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that is close to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. By starting high, I give myself the opportunity to negotiate down if Bob rejects the offer. I'm also trying to be friendly and positive to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value. I'm willing to try to negotiate a better deal with Bob before settling for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately I can't go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer. While I understand your position, I'm still not able to move beyond $8,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is firm on his offer, and I'm not willing to go lower than $9,000. At this point, John is a more reliable buyer, offering a price that meets my minimum requirements. I will sell the product to John for $10,000."
