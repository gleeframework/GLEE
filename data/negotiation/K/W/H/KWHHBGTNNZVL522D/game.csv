"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1700000. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1700000 and $1500000. How about $1600000? Is that a number you'd be comfortable with?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I think we're getting close to a fair price.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'll meet you at $1550000. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to be careful with my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1550000 and $1250000. How about $1400000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $1400000. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,10,
