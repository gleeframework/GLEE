"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at $1,200,000. This reflects its unique value and potential for your business. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is certainly an offer, it doesn't reflect the full value this product holds. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, reflecting the potential benefits it offers your business. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without overpaying. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
