"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and allows for potential concessions later on.  I believe the product is worth more than $15,000 to me, so I'm hoping to get a good return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is still above my minimum of $15,000, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a profitable price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round. I still have time and believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's a firm offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and agree to this price. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John at the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $12,000 is still not high enough, and we are running out of rounds. To ensure I get my minimum value, I will choose to sell the product to John for $15,000."
