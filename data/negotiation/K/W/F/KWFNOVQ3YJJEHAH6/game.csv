"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 82?",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $80. That's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that 80 is a fair price for you, Bob. However, I've already invested some time and effort into this product, and I'd like to get a bit more for it. How about we meet at 81?",81.0,Alice,5,
