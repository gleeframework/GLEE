{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer sets a starting point that is above your minimum value, allowing for potential negotiation.  It's important to be confident in your product's worth and leave room for a compromise if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is your minimum value, you can still try to get closer to your initial offer of $15,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer before settling on Bob's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, I'm still a bit above $10,000. How about we split the difference and meet at $12,500? Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10000. Would you be willing to meet me at $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob has come up to $11,000, which is closer to your desired price than John's offer.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most financially beneficial decision."
