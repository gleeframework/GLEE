"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $150 to me!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $135 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum. There are 9 more rounds, and Bob can always buy from John for $120, so it makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob is aiming for the $120 price from John, so starting at $125 is a good middle ground.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly but firm, acknowledging Alice's value while stating Bob's limit.
* **Counteroffer:** $125 is a reasonable starting point for negotiations, and still leaves room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $130? That way we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above Bob's limit:** $130 is still more than Bob's $120 limit. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There are 7 more rounds, and Bob can still choose to buy from John.  
* **Potential compromise:** By rejecting, Bob can try to push for a lower price, aiming for a compromise closer to his desired $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $128.  It's a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 128} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase:**  Bob is increasing his offer from $125 to $128, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** Bob is again highlighting fairness, emphasizing that both parties need to find a solution that works for them. 
* **Staying within his limit:** $128 is still within Bob's maximum budget, giving him some room for further negotiation. 
* **Strategic move:**  By making a small counteroffer, Bob shows flexibility and signals that he is seriously considering the deal."
