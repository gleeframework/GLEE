"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $150 to me!  Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $130? That way we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $128.  It's a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",128.0,Bob,4,
