"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $150 to me!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to me, implying quality and potential for good value for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  The price is not too far from Bob's perceived value, increasing the chance he'll counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation going and avoids an immediate rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still do better. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle.  This keeps the negotiation going while still protecting my profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $130? That way we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the ""fair deal"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Setting the Stage for Agreement:**  This counteroffer is likely to be closer to Bob's acceptable price point, increasing the chance of a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $128.  It's a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $128 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $125.  While I would prefer to get closer to $130, I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit, even if it's slightly less than I initially hoped for."
