"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid I'm not comfortable going as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13000 yet. I'm willing to come down a bit further, so I'm counteroffering at $13250. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",13250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $13000, which is the same price I offered in Round 4. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",13000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, and I'm not sure how much more I'm willing to budge. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm counteroffering at $13200. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can finally meet on a price.",13200.0,Alice,9,
