"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you're providing, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $14000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Would it be possible to consider $15000 as a counteroffer? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $16000. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium warranty and dedicated support for the next year. With this added value, I'm willing to consider $16000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the additional value you're offering, but I'm still looking to keep my expenses within $12000. Would it be possible for us to reach an agreement at that price point? I believe this would be a win-win situation for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
