"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I really love the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 simply isn't enough for this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $825,000? This gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can live with.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $825,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. That's the best I can do for now.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand we're close, but $775,000 still falls short of the value this product brings. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows you to secure this exceptional product.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
