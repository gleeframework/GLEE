Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate you starting with a fair price. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob, and I believe I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still a bit far from my target price.  How about $11,250?  That's a reasonable compromise, and it gives us both something to work with."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be. How about $11,100? It's a good compromise for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $11,500, Bob's offer of $11,100 is still a good deal and we are getting close to closing the deal. I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, he might walk away and I'd be forced to sell to John for $10,000."
