"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price, $1,200,000. This is the maximum value Bob is willing to pay, and I'm hoping he'll accept it. 

If he rejects, I'll assess the situation and adjust my strategy. I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I won't compromise my bottom line of $1,200,000. The option to sell to John provides a safety net if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not going to settle for such a low price. It's important to remember that while $900,000 is better than nothing, it's not even close to what I value the product at. 

I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, keeping in mind that John is ready to pay my full asking price. I want to gauge Bob's sincerity and willingness to meet me halfway."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my value. 

I'm hoping to find a middle ground and get a reasonable price. I'm also testing the waters to see how much wiggle room Bob has. If he rejects this counteroffer, I might consider lowering the price slightly, but I'll keep John as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's an improvement from his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm not going to settle for anything less than $1,100,000 at this point.

I'll counteroffer again, but I'll be more cautious this time. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John. I'm running out of time, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still holding out for a better price than Bob's last offer.  I'm approaching my bottom line, and I'm running out of rounds. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely have to sell to John to avoid losing too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but with only four rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate.  I don't want to risk losing a good deal with John. 

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, I need to secure a deal that's fair and within my minimum. Selling to John ensures that I reach my minimum and don't lose out on a profitable opportunity."
