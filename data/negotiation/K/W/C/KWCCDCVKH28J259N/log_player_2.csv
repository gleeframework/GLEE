"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's close this quickly! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows him to start negotiating and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit high for me at the moment. How about $9,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,500? That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's target price:**  $9,500 is very close to Bob's target price of $9,000.
* **It's a better deal than John's:** $9,500 is significantly less than the $12,000 Bob would pay John.
* **Time is a factor:**  There are only 7 rounds left. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product without risking further negotiations that may lead to a higher price or a failed deal."
