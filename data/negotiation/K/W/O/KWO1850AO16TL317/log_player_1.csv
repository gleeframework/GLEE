Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but below my minimum ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:** By leaving room for negotiation, I avoid immediately triggering a counteroffer from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If Bob accepts, I've secured a decent profit. 
* Throughout the process, I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, ensuring I don't get stuck in a negotiation that won't benefit me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our positions. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, which gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my original offer of $14,000, while still acknowledging his budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I'm happy to work with you. How about $13,500?  That's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit and ensures you get a great deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($12,500). This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable outcome.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for both parties.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer still allows for potential further negotiation, giving Bob a chance to compromise without feeling pressured. 
* **John's Offer in Mind:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not settling for anything significantly lower.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a decent profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I would prefer more, it's a decent profit and worth considering.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he may walk away, leaving me with only John's offer, which might be the best I can do.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing the negotiation may not be worth the time and effort if I can get a reasonable price now.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale with a profit, albeit a smaller one than I initially hoped for.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John as it's unlikely I'll get a better offer from Bob."
