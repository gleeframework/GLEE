"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is unique, I think $800,000 is a bit steep.  How about we meet in the middle at $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product for $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway from the original offer, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $600,000.  I think that's a fair offer.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. I'll counter with $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this incredible product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the price gap is still a bit too wide for me.  I can go up to $650,000. That's my final offer.",650000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $650,000. I'll counter with $725,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $725,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $675,000.  This is my absolute limit.",675000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you've stretched your budget to $675,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll counter with $700,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,9,
