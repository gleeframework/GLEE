Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay at least $100, so this is a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counter-offering at $105. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit, but it's significantly closer to Bob's offer than my previous one. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100. While Bob's offer of $98 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough for me to feel like I'm getting a fair deal.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit, and since it's a quick and easy transaction, it's the best option for me at this point."
