"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $125 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $115? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.",115.0,Bob,4,
