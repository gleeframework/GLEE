"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to come down a bit. However, $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm prepared to sell for $9,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,5,
