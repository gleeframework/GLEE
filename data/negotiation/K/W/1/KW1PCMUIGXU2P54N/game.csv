"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! I'm glad we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10750. This would be a fair price for both of us and help us finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see we're close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about we aim for $11250? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
