"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this price is fair for both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,
