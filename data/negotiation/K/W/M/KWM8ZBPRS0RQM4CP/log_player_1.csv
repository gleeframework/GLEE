Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. 
* This price is higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* This gives Bob a potential gain of $2,000 and me a gain of $1,000. 
* If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I meet my minimum goal. 

This offer balances maximizing my profit with the possibility of reaching a deal with Bob, potentially resulting in a quicker sale and less hassle."
