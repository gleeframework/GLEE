Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really like. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $120, I want to start with a price higher than his valuation but not so high that it's unreasonable.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate. It allows me to potentially meet in the middle while still making a profit. 
* **Backup Buyer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so I'm not desperate and can afford to aim higher with Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
