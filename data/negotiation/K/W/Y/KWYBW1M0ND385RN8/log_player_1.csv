Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $11,500."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed $12,000 from John, it's always best to try for a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product slightly below your minimum acceptable price ($12,000) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $11,500 offer leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, allowing you to potentially earn even more than $12,000.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you can confidently present the product's value to Bob and justify the $11,500 price tag. 
* Be prepared to walk away if Bob rejects the offer or tries to negotiate a price significantly lower than what's acceptable to you. You have John as a reliable backup buyer."
