Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($12,000). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the deal and the value Bob will get, encouraging him to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation process going. 
* **Plan B:** I'm aware of John's offer of $12,000, which gives me a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000. 
* **I have a strong alternative.** John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if I can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my price point. Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $10,000 to $9,500, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:** $9,500 is still above Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" Bob will get, and using language like ""common ground"" to encourage him to consider my offer. 
* **Avoiding Stalemate:** I'm not going to completely reject his offer, but I'm pushing for a better price. I want to avoid a situation where we simply go back and forth without finding a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $9500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is only $3,000 less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Potential for Future Deals:** While it's not ideal, accepting this offer allows me to potentially build a relationship with Bob for future transactions. He might be willing to pay a higher price in the future.
* **Avoiding the Risk of Loss:**  I'm not confident that I can negotiate a higher price, and if I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing him as a customer and potentially having to sell to John at my minimum price. 

By accepting this offer, I'm making a calculated decision to secure a sale and potentially open doors for future opportunities."
