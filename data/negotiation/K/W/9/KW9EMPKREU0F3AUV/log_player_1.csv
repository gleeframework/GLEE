I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $11,000 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I would like to get a bit more, I'm running out of time and rounds in this negotiation. I'm not convinced Bob will come up to my asking price, and I don't want to risk losing out on the guaranteed $12,000."
