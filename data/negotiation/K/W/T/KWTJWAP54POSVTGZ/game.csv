"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find this product for this price anywhere else.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $120.  It's a fair price for both of us and I'm ready to close the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
