Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Backup Plan:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a bolder initial offer to Bob."
