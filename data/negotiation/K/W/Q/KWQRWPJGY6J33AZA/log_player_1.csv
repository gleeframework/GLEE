"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $11,000 is far below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to sell below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which still reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in continuing the discussion."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll be pushing for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for us both. How about we split the difference and go with $14,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I could stretch my budget to $12,500, but that's really my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and we are nearing the end of our negotiation rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John for a higher price.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000."
