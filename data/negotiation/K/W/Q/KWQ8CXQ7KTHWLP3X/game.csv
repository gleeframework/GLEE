"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we settle at $18,000? This reflects a more accurate valuation while still offering you a good deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Can we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to pay $10,500",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is still too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,5,
