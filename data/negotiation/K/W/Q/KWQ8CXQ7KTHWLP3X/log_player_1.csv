Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we settle at $18,000? This reflects a more accurate valuation while still offering you a good deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Can we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to pay $10,500 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still significantly less than John's standing offer. There's room to negotiate further and try to get closer to $15,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is still too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to keep costs down. Can we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point. It's clear that getting him much closer to $15,000 will be difficult.  Therefore, it's in your best interest to cut your losses and take John's guaranteed $15,000 offer."
