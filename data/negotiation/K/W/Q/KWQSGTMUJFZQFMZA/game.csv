"I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay that much for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $105 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $90. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, which would be $97.50. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $101.25. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's close the deal at this point.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $101.25. I'm willing to pay up to $99. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price?",99.0,Bob,6,
