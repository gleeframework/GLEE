Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm aware I can always sell to John for $8,000, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** I can likely get a better price from Bob by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **John is a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $8,000 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, lowering my price from $10,000 but still above Bob's offer. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to encourage a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Further Gain:**  I'm unlikely to get a higher price from Bob, especially since I can sell to John for the same amount.
* **Closing the Deal:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
