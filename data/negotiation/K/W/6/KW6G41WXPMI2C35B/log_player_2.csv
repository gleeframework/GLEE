"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This offer is too high. It's significantly more than my budget and what John offers.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider something closer to $100."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point to see how Alice might negotiate. It's a significant jump down, but it leaves room for negotiation while staying well below my budget and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $130 is still more than I want to pay, especially when I have John's offer of $120. I'll try to negotiate a little further, but I'm getting close to taking John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $130 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $110? That's a fair offer, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to nudge the price closer to my desired range. It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also signaling that I'm not willing to go much higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise again. I'll meet you at $125. That's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $125 is still more than John's offer of $120. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  I've spent enough time negotiating with Alice."
