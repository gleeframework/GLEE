"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $120 is still too high. You can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than your ideal price.  You're still willing to negotiate and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? "", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $105, and that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $105 is within your budget and a good compromise.  It's a better deal than going to John and buying it for $150. While you could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice backing out or you losing the product to another buyer is high."
