"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest possible price. While $12,500 is better than John's offer, it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob should continue to aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,750 and $12,500, which is $12,125. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let's finalize the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,125 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000, and it's closer to Bob's desired price point than previous offers. Continuing to negotiate might get a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John makes accepting this offer the best choice."
