,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $155. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  This is my final offer.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $140, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $150. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,5,
