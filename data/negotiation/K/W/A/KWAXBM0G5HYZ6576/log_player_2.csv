"Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $125.** This is more than the product is worth to you ($150). 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll buy from John for $150.** This is still more than the product is worth to you, but it's the best option available since it's the lowest price you're willing to pay."
