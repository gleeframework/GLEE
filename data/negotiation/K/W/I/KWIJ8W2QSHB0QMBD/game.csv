"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a special price of $18,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate the offer, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $12,000.  This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on this product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to make a significant step, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $12,000, which is $13,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice.  Let's split the difference one more time.  I'm willing to offer $12,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach.",13500.0,Alice,7,
