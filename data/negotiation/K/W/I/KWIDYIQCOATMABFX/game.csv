"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price that takes into account your concerns, while also reflecting the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $950,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
