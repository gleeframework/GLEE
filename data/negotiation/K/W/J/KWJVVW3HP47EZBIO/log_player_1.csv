**Reasoning:**

Bob has been very clear that his maximum price is $100.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a better result. Since we have a guaranteed offer from John for $100, it makes sense to take that offer now rather than risk Bob not budging and getting stuck with a lower offer later."
