Round 2

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting and matches John's offer, I'm not willing to accept it yet.  I still believe the product is worth more than $1,200,000, and I have 8 more rounds to try and get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get Bob to budge."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,300,000.  This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to get a fair return on my investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I respect that.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle again.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1275000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $1260000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe this is a fair price that balances the value of the product for both of us.

**Explanation:**

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm still not able to go below $1,265,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting very close to John's offer, and with only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price.  I'm not comfortable accepting $1,240,000, as it's significantly lower than my minimum target.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, ensuring a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum requirement."
