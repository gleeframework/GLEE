"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that holds significant value. While I can't disclose specifics at this stage, I assure you it's worth well over $1000000 to me. I'm willing to part with it for $1500000.  Consider this a starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000. Can you meet me halfway?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1200000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below my minimum. Let's find some common ground. I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $1350000. This shows my commitment to this deal, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1225000. Can you consider this offer?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1225000 is still too far below what I need. Let's try to get closer. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  If you're truly serious about this deal, let's work together to bridge this gap.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1250000. Can you consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but $1250000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to go down to $1275000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you can see that I'm serious about making this deal work.  Let's close this gap and get this done.",1275000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm truly committed to making this deal work, but  $1262500 just isn't enough. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time and offer $1268750. This is a significant compromise for me, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1268750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm afraid $1268750 is still a bit above my budget. I've gone as low as I can, so I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'll offer $1260000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John.",1260000.0,Bob,10,
