Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $150 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, and it's also the same price John is offering.  Since I can secure the sale immediately, I'll accept Bob's offer."
