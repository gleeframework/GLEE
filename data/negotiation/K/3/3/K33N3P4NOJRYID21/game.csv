"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. I think this is a great price considering its worth to you is $12,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is still a good deal considering its worth to you is $12,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that price point be workable for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $13,000. This is still a good price considering its worth to you is $12,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
