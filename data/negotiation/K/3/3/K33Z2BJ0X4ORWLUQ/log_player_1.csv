"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This gives me a good starting point and allows for some negotiation room. It's important to remember that I need to make at least $80 to make this worthwhile, so I'm aiming for a higher price to maximize profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $95 is  above my minimum of $80, and I'm confident I can't get a much better price.  Accepting his offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
