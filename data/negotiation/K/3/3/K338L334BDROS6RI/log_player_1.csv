Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a quick sale.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is above Bob's value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and still get a good price.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes mutual benefit, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for counteroffers, indicating flexibility.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm aware of John's offer, which serves as a safety net and gives me bargaining power.

This strategy allows for a potential win-win situation while keeping my options open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer is still below my desired minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for a better deal.  I can counteroffer and aim for a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:** While $1,500,000 is tempting, I'm not desperate.  By continuing to negotiate with Bob, I might be able to secure a price closer to my ideal.

This strategy allows me to potentially get a better deal while maintaining the option to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Counteroffer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not fully meeting him in the middle. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm justifying my counteroffer by referencing the value of the product. This helps build a logical argument.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message again emphasizes a desire for a fair deal for both parties, leaving the door open for further negotiation.

This strategy aims to push Bob closer to my desired price while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $1,180,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lower Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,180,000 is significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000.  There's a considerable gap, and further negotiation might be unproductive.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on and eat into my time.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** John is a reliable buyer offering a secure and satisfying price.  Selling to John allows me to achieve my minimum desired profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

This decision prioritizes maximizing profit and minimizing risk by taking advantage of the guaranteed offer from John."
