"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. My initial price is $180. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a better price than John's offer.
* **Friendly Approach:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value to pique Bob's interest. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation strong, while leaving room for compromise if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Potential for better negotiation:** While I'm not thrilled with Bob's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a better price by counter-offering and seeing if we can meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Sell to John is not ideal:** While selling to John guarantees $150, I'd prefer to potentially earn more by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer closer to minimum:** I'm offering $160, which is still above my minimum of $150 but significantly closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** My message remains friendly and expresses my desire to reach an agreement.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I emphasize the goal of finding a price that works for both of us. This helps build rapport and creates a win-win scenario.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap and potentially get a deal closer to my desired price, while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not quite there:**  $140 is only $10 below my minimum acceptable value. While tempting, I'm still hesitant to settle at such a low price.
* **Opportunity to close the deal:** There's still a good chance I can get a slightly better price by counter-offering once more.
* **Selling to John is still not ideal:**  I'd rather continue negotiating with Bob and see if I can close the deal closer to my minimum acceptable value.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, aiming to finalize the deal at a price that is more favorable to me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. How about we split the difference and go with $145? This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can finally close this sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and finality:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between Bob's offer ($140) and my minimum ($150). This shows a commitment to finding a solution and signals that I'm ready to close the deal.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** I reiterate the idea of a ""good deal for both of us"" to highlight the win-win aspect of this offer.
* **Direct and concise message:** The message is clear, concise, and avoids any further haggling.

By offering $145, I'm aiming to close the deal quickly and avoid further rounds of negotiation. This price is still above my minimum and represents a decent profit, while also being within Bob's budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $130 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems Bob is unwilling to budge much further.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:**  While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, selling to John guarantees a profit of $150. 

**Conclusion:**  Since we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum, it's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed offer from John."
