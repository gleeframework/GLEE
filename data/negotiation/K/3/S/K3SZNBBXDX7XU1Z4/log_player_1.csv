Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is closer to my value of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Appeal to Bob's interests:** I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not starting at the absolute top, leaving space for Bob to counter without feeling like he's losing too much.
* **Plan B:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, which helps me stay firm if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not ideal:** While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my value of $15,000 and leaves me with a smaller profit margin.
* **Room for counteroffers:** I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  There's still room to negotiate.
* **The risk of selling to John:**  While I could sell to John for $15,000, I'm still willing to take the risk of further negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a better price.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I emphasize the ""fair deal"" aspect for both of us to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Staying above my floor:** $13,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not giving away too much.

**Next steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response and be prepared to negotiate further if needed. I'll also keep in mind my backup option of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $13,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation stalled:**  Bob is consistently pushing for a lower price. We're getting closer, but not by much.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential profit from further negotiation is small ($250) compared to the time and effort it will take.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me the maximum profit with no further effort or risk. 

I'm choosing to sell to John to secure a better price and move on to other opportunities. While I would have liked to get closer to my initial goal, the potential gain is not worth the continued negotiation."
