"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. It's a rare opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for my liking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1100000. This is my final compromise on the price, so I hope you can see the value in this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950000. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I can do $1050000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980000. Can you consider this price?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $990000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $990000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $960000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",960000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $980000. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer.",980000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $960000, and I'm not interested in going back and forth anymore. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet in the middle. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to make a decision today. Can you meet me at $960000?",960000.0,Bob,10,
