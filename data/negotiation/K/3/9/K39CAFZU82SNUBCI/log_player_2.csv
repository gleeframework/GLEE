You can get the product for less than $1,100,000, so it's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.

You have three options:

You are still in a better position to get a lower price than $1,050,000. It is worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and agree on $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'm willing to go up to $1020000, but that's my final offer. If you're still interested, let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice's final offer of $1,020,000 is still within your budget and significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000. It's a good deal, so you should accept it."
