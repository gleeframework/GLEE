# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to compromise.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what he can get from John. He should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice has stated she won't go lower than $875,000, and Bob can get it from John for $800,000.  It's more beneficial for him to buy from John and save the extra $75,000."
