"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's potential value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies flexibility, suggesting I'm willing to negotiate. 

This approach balances my goal of maximizing profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and also below the $100 value Bob perceives the product to be. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price and potentially find a middle ground. 
* **Not selling to John yet:** Selling to John for $120 is my fallback option, but I have 8 rounds left and believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That would give us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:**  I'm making a counter-offer that's closer to my desired price but still acknowledges Bob's budget constraints.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a compromise, suggesting that it's a fair price for both of us.
* **Encouragement:** I'm using positive language and asking for Bob's opinion to keep the negotiation open and encourage him to accept. 
* **Midpoint Approach:**  $105 is the midpoint between my initial offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $90, suggesting a fair compromise. 

This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while protecting my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  $105 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $95?  That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $100 value Bob himself sees in the product.  This indicates he has room to go higher.
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:**  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my desired price.
* **Not selling to John yet:** Selling to John for $120 is still my fallback, but I have six rounds left and believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm happy to come down a little more, but $95 is still too low for me.  How about $100?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it's closer to my cost.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's right in the middle between my last offer ($105) and Bob's latest offer ($95). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, subtly pushing him to consider the price is fair.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a touch of urgency by saying ""Let's make this deal happen!"" to encourage Bob to accept.

This approach aims to find a middle ground while still pushing Bob towards a price closer to my desired value."
