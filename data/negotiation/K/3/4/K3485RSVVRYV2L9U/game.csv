"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do it for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That would give us both a good deal. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  $105 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $95?  That's a fair offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm happy to come down a little more, but $95 is still too low for me.  How about $100?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it's closer to my cost.  Let's make this deal happen!",100.0,Alice,5,
