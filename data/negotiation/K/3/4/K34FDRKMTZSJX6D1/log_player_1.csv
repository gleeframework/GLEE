Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding her minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested. 
* **Secure a Quick Sale:**  Alice has a guaranteed buyer in John. By pricing the product aggressively, she increases the chance of a quick sale to Bob. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while minimizing the risk of him rejecting the offer."
