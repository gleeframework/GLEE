"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This represents a substantial amount and allows for a fair return for you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer and providing your perspective. While $1,600,000 represents the product's high-end value, I'm open to finding a solution that benefits us both. To meet you closer to your budget, I'm willing to consider $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I want to make this deal work for both of us. How about we meet halfway between our two offers? I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This reflects my commitment to reaching an agreement while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to compromise. While $1,275,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower figure.  Let's split the difference again:  I'm offering $1,200,000. This is a fair price, allows us both to achieve a good outcome, and keeps us on track for a successful transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
