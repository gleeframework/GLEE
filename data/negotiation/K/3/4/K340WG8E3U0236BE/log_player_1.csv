"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""potential"" of the product, I'm subtly reminding Bob that its value might be higher than his current assessment.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message keeps the tone positive and invites Bob's input, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate. 
 
This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** If Bob accepts my initial high offer, I gain the most.
2. **Understand Bob's Position:** His response will reveal how much he's willing to pay and how aggressive his counteroffer might be.
3. **Control the Negotiation:**  By starting high, I set the initial frame for the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This represents a substantial amount and allows for a fair return for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). I have room to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. Selling to John is my safety net, but I'll explore getting a better deal from Bob before taking that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer and providing your perspective. While $1,600,000 represents the product's high-end value, I'm open to finding a solution that benefits us both. To meet you closer to your budget, I'm willing to consider $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've significantly reduced my price from $1,600,000 to $1,450,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also keeps me well above both his offer and my minimum price.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point and prevent Bob from anchoring too low. 
* **Compromise Language:**  Using phrases like ""finding a solution"" and ""meet you closer"" indicates flexibility while still aiming for a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $1,100,000, which is still below my absolute minimum.  However, he seems genuinely interested and is using language that suggests a desire to close the deal (""walk away satisfied""). This indicates there might be room for negotiation, even if it's just a small concession on his part. I'm willing to counter one more time to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I want to make this deal work for both of us. How about we meet halfway between our two offers? I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This reflects my commitment to reaching an agreement while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  This is a classic negotiation tactic that can be perceived as fair.  It shows Bob I'm willing to move significantly from my last offer while still staying above my minimum.
* **Justification:** I'm emphasizing my desire for a mutually beneficial deal but subtly reminding Bob about the product's value to justify the higher end of the compromise.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By not countering with another round of back-and-forth, I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency. Bob might feel this is his best chance to get the product below $1,300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to compromise. While $1,275,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower figure.  Let's split the difference again:  I'm offering $1,200,000. This is a fair price, allows us both to achieve a good outcome, and keeps us on track for a successful transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my absolute minimum price of $1,200,000. While I could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk he might walk away or become less willing to negotiate as we get closer to the end of our 10 rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
