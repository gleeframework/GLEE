Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, knowing it's likely Bob won't accept this offer.  However, this gives me room to negotiate and still potentially get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation in hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a price of $95. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  Hopefully, this will be enough to close the deal and avoid selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more than $100, Bob has shown he's not willing to go higher than $85.  I don't want to keep going back and forth and risk getting stuck with a price lower than John's offer. It's time to take the guaranteed $100."
