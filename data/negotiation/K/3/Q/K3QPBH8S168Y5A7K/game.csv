"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'd be happy to make a deal at that price.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $100. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer you a deal for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
