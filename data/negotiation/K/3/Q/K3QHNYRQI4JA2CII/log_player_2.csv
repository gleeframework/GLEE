# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,450,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,200,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,200,000
