Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This price is above my minimum value of $100, and leaves some room for negotiation. It also allows for a potential profit of $15, which is a decent return. 

If Bob rejects, I'll see how much he's willing to pay, but I'm ready to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I still think I can do better. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a little closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

I'm going to counter with $112.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer of $110. It's still above my minimum and leaves some room for potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $111 is just a dollar away from my counteroffer. It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for less."
