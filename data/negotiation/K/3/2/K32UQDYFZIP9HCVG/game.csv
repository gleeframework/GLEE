"Alice, I appreciate your offer and I see the value in this product. However, $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for it.  This is a serious offer and I'm confident it's a fair price given my budget and the potential value of this product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
