Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500} 
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, Alice's offer of $6,000 is too high for my liking. I've tried negotiating, but it seems we're not close to a price I'm comfortable with. It's more cost-effective to buy from John at $15,000 than to risk another round of negotiation that might not yield a better outcome."
