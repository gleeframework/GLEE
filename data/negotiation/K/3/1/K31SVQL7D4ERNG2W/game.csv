"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $1,300,000? I believe this would still provide a good return for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I need to get for the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This gives you a good deal, and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I'm unable to increase my offer. I would like to propose $1,300,000 as the final price for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
