Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is very unlikely to go above $115. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than to risk getting stuck with a lower offer or a stalemate with Bob."
