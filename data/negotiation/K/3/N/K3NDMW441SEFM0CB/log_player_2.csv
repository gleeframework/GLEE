"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You should attempt to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price. It's likely she's willing to negotiate since her value for the product is $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000, but it's still within my acceptable range. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to Alice ($1,500,000) and my own maximum budget ($1,000,000). If Alice is willing to negotiate, she should be open to this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's a slight improvement from her first offer, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, hoping to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's still not coming down to my ideal price. I'm going to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This represents a significant increase from my last offer but is still well below Alice's asking price. It's also close enough to John's price that it makes it worthwhile to continue negotiating with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. While I could continue to negotiate, it's becoming clear that she's not willing to budge much. I've already spent 5 rounds on this negotiation, and the likelihood of reaching a mutually acceptable price in the remaining 5 rounds seems low. Therefore, I will stop the negotiation and buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  It's the best option available to me right now."
