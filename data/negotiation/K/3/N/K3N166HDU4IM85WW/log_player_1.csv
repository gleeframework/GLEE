Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $150 as possible since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below my absolute minimum gives Bob the impression of a deal and leaves me space to potentially negotiate a bit higher if he counters.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it at $150 right away might make Bob think I'm desperate to sell, potentially leading to a lower counter-offer."
