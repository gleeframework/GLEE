Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $14,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. While $11,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $12,500. It's still a good deal for you, considering the value, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget. I'm still very interested, but $12,500 is a little too steep for me. How about we settle at $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. While I'd love to get more from Bob, I'm running out of rounds, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to close a deal at a price I'm comfortable with.  $12,000 is my minimum, and John is a sure bet."
