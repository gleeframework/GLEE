"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's always better to negotiate and try to get a lower price, even if it means going through multiple rounds. You have a good chance of getting a better deal, and you're not losing anything by rejecting the initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. This counteroffer is half of her price, which should make her consider it seriously. It's important to start strong and show Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While I would prefer a lower price, there's no guarantee I can get it with further negotiation. Accepting this offer means getting the product for the price I'm willing to pay and avoiding further haggling. It's a good deal for me at this point."
