Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,150,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,150,000. While she might budge a little more, it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price of $1,200,000, which is only $50,000 more than Alice's current offer. Accepting John's offer ensures you get the product without further haggling and potential disappointment."
