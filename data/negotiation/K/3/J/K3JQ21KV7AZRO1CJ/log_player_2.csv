"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and try to get a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it sets a strong starting point for negotiation. By aiming low, we can gauge Alice's willingness to move on price and leave room for compromise in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $13,000 is still above our target price and what John offers. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down, Alice. While I appreciate the offer, I'm working with a tight budget.  Could we do $11,000? That would work for me."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

We're inching closer. This offer signals our willingness to compromise but keeps us firmly below John's offer. Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure I can go as low as $11,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough one.  Alice is very close to John's price.  However, we still have rounds to negotiate and every dollar saved counts. We'll push a little further, but we need to be ready to accept if Alice doesn't budge much more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and call it $12,250? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 12250
}
``` 

This counteroffer does a few things:

* **Splits the Difference:** It shows a willingness to compromise and meet Alice closer to her price.
* **Firm Language:**  Using ""final offer"" signals we're getting close to our limit and may walk away soon.
* **Still Below John:** It's crucial to stay below John's $12,000 offer to make the negotiation worthwhile.

This is a calculated risk. Alice might accept, giving us a small saving, or she might counter-offer, pushing us closer to our fallback option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,250. I'll tell you what - I'll meet you at $13,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's the highest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It's time to walk away. Alice seems stuck at $13,000, and she's even repeated this offer. It's unlikely she'll move significantly lower. John's guaranteed $12,000 offer is now the better deal, even if it means not getting a discount with Alice."
