Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $70 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $82 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.

We're still quite a bit away from a price I'd be happy with. Let's see if we can negotiate further."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $80 for the product. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has gone down to her lowest price, which is still a good deal for you. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and further negotiation might make her less willing to deal."
