"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $80 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $125?  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $125 is still a bit high.  Let's try $95. This is as high as I can go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $95 is still too low. I'm willing to go down to $135. This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $135 is still above my budget. I'm firm on $100. It's a fair price, considering we're both getting something out of it.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $100 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $115. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",115.0,Alice,7,
