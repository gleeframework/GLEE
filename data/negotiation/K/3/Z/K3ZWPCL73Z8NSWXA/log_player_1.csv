Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price. Since John is willing to pay $12,000, there's no reason to go lower.  This gives Bob a chance to accept or make a counteroffer, and I can then evaluate his position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and it's not even close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's worth risking another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer with a price that's more reasonable, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $11,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping this is a more attractive proposition for Bob, but I'm still willing to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I could continue to negotiate, I've reached a point where the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential gain. John is already willing to pay my minimum price, so it's more beneficial to sell to him now and secure the sale."
