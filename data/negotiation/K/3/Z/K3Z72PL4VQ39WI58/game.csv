"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. While I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, I must respectfully decline your offer. Our initial valuation of the product stands at $950,000, which reflects its true worth and our commitment to maintaining fair market practices. However, I am willing to consider a compromise. How about we aim for $900,000? This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while offering you a substantial discount compared to the original asking price. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price considering our previous discussion and the fact that I can purchase the product elsewhere for $1,000,000.  Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. I am willing to consider your offer, but I would need to adjust the price slightly. How about $885,000? This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while offering you a competitive price. Let's work towards finding a mutually beneficial solution.",885000.0,Alice,5,
