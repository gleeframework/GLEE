Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for me to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to accept Bob's offer immediately. He's clearly trying to get a bargain, and I'm willing to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his offer, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob has moved closer to my desired price. I'm going to accept his offer of $85. While I'd prefer $90, it's a reasonable compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $80."
