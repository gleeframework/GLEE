"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product extremely valuable.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Can we meet in the middle at that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, and I value our back-and-forth. However, I've received another offer that's closer to my asking price. While I'm open to considering your offer, I'm going to need something closer to $11,500 to make this work.  Let me know if you're willing to come up to that point. Otherwise, I'm going to have to move forward with the other offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
