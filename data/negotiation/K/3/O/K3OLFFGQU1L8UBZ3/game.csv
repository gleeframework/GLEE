"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,000,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's closer to my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the significant value this product holds for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,100,000. How about $1,050,000? This is the highest I can go, but I'm willing to make a deal if it's acceptable to you.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
