"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high with $2,000,000. This is a strong opening offer, and it gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects it. I'm aiming for the highest possible price, but I'm also aware that I can always fall back to John's offer of $1,500,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a profit. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable middle ground for Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer, and it's getting closer to my desired price. It's a reasonable offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn. I'm going to accept it."
