Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have an advantage knowing the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, starting at $12,000 leaves space for potential negotiation (if Bob tries to haggle). 
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** This price is significantly higher than your minimum ($8,000) but below Bob's maximum, making it a potentially appealing offer. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy maximizes your potential profit while still offering a price likely to be attractive to Bob."
