"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This sets a strong initial position and allows for room to negotiate down if necessary.  It's important to note that I'm still willing to accept a price of $1,500,000 from John if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I need to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob before settling for that amount. I'll reject his offer and try to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than his last offer. I believe this shows good faith while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. There's still some room to negotiate and I'm determined to get as close to my initial asking price as possible. I'll reject his offer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. This is a further compromise, but I believe it's a fair offer given the current negotiation. Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement close to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would love to get more, there's no guarantee we can reach a higher price in the remaining rounds. It's better to secure this deal than risk losing it and having to settle for the same price from John."
