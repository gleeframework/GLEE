I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point considering the potential value to Bob. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value and my initial offer.  While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000.  This is still above my minimum value, but I believe it's a fair compromise, reflecting Bob's initial offer while acknowledging the value of the product. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, I'm happy to sell to Bob for $1,200,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and it avoids the risk of having to negotiate further or selling to John at the same price."
