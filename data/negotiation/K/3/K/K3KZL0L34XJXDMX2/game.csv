"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe you might be interested in. I'm initially offering it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for it.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $110 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $75? I think that's a fair offer.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $75 is closer to what you're looking for, I'm still aiming for a bit more. Would you be willing to meet at $95? That's a significant compromise from my initial offer.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I see we are getting closer.  I could go up to $80, but that's my absolute limit.",80.0,Bob,6,
