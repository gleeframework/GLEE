"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to inform you that I'm looking for a price of $1,200,000 for the product. This is the minimum I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident it's a fair price given its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $850,000 is not sufficient for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirements.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfortable range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to achieve our goals. Let's bridge the gap and close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my requirements.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to closing this deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free maintenance package and a 1-year warranty. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my requirements.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer and the added extras, but $1,075,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $975,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  If you're not willing to come down, I'll have to consider my other options.",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on $975,000, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000, and I'll throw in an additional 6 months of premium support to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,9,
