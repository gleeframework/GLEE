``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob can potentially save money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, he has room to negotiate.  It's likely that Alice will be willing to negotiate further, especially since she is motivated to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $700,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $750,000. This is a good starting point for negotiation.  It's a reasonable counteroffer that shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal.  Alice might accept this offer, or she might counter with a higher price."
