"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its value to you.  This would allow us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me is $1,200,000. I believe this is a great opportunity for both of us to benefit from the deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $887,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing us to make a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know if you're open to this.",887500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $887,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $912,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to me is $1,200,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",912500.0,Alice,5,
