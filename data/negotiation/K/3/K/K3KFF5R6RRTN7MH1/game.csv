"Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $20000 for it.  It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that's a great product, but unfortunately $20000 is well above my budget. I'm really interested in buying it, but I'm only able to offer $8000 right now. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'd be happy to accept $12000.  It's still a great price considering its value. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $12000 is still a little too high for me.  Could you consider $9500? I really want this product and I believe this price would be fair for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make a final concession. Let's meet in the middle at $10500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value. If you're still interested, this is my last offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
