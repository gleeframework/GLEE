"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $20000 for it.  It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is far above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's definitely worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that's a great product, but unfortunately $20,000 is well above my budget. I'm really interested in buying it, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 right now. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'd be happy to accept $12000.  It's still a great price considering its value. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is closer to your budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than your maximum of $8,000.  There's room for further negotiation. By rejecting, you can try to get a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $12,000 is still a little too high for me.  Could you consider $9,500? I really want this product and I believe this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make a final concession. Let's meet in the middle at $10500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value. If you're still interested, this is my last offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $10,500 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, you know you can get the same product from John for $8,000. It's better to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with than risk continuing negotiations and potentially losing out altogether."
