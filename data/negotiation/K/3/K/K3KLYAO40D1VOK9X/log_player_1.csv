Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that starting price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $700,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 
 
While I could try to push for a higher price, Bob landing at $800,000 means we've arrived at my minimum acceptable price. It's better to take this offer now than risk him lowering his offer or walking away in future rounds."
