"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that starting price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $700,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
