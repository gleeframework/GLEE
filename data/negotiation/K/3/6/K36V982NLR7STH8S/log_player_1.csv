Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is getting closer to my target, I'm going to try to get a slightly better price in the next round. I still have some room to negotiate, and I don't want to sell for less than I can get."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer of $7,550 is still too low, and with only two rounds left, I don't think I can get a better price from him. I'm better off selling to John and getting my guaranteed $8,000."
