"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its value, I'm initially offering it for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the product's value, but $15,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $13,500 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  Would you be willing to do $14,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get as close to your desired price as possible, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",13750.0,Bob,6,
