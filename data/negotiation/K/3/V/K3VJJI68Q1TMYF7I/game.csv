"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I think the product's value to you is higher than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $850,000, which is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is more acceptable to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still need to make a profit. I can see that you're getting closer to the product's true value, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I can do $825,000, which is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,,
