Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset with immense potential. My asking price is $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This price is fair considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob and can still get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John immediately would secure a higher profit, but I want to explore if I can push Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1080000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1080000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a better price. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1065000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,065,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not where I want to be. I have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can still push Bob further. Selling to John would guarantee a higher profit, but I want to explore if I can bridge the gap with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable price."
