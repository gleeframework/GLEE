"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing I can always go lower.  I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,800,000 is a decent offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject and try to get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,900,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1700000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $1,700,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to $1,900,000.  There are still rounds to go and I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $1,700,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,850,000.  This is a significant product, and I believe this price reflects its value."", ""product_price"": 1850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1650000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm only halfway through the negotiation rounds.  While I don't want to walk away with less than $1,700,000, I'm concerned I'm going to be stuck at a price I'm not comfortable with.  I'm going to sell to John and secure my minimum price."
