Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a slight improvement from her previous offer, it's still above his target price of $12,000. He should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $9,200 is still higher than Bob's target price of $12,000, and it's unlikely she'll go lower. Buying from John guarantees a price within his budget, even if it's not the absolute lowest possible."
