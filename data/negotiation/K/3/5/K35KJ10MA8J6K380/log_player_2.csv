"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're trying to save money, it's always worth exploring options before immediately accepting.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to see if you can negotiate a lower price.  You still have the option to buy from John for $100 if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $80 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial price and gives you room to negotiate further if necessary. You're still willing to pay a good amount for the product, but showing that you're serious about saving money will encourage Alice to consider your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $100 to $90. While it's still not the lowest possible price, it's a good compromise and within your budget.  It's better to accept this offer rather than risk further negotiation and possibly ending up paying the same amount to John."
