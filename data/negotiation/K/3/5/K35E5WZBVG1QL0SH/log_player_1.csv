"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth more than that to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above your minimum acceptable price ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that you're serious about selling the product but you're not desperate to sell it at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is above my minimum acceptable price, I'm confident I can get more from Bob. The product is worth $12,000 to him, and I can leverage this in future rounds.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  Given the value of the product, I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a price I can accept. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my target of $10,000,  $9,000 is a fair price and still a significant profit for me.  There's a good chance Bob won't budge further, and I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely for a few hundred dollars more.  Accepting his offer is the best strategy at this point."
