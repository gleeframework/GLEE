"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but it's still below what I can accept. How about we settle at $1,375,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
