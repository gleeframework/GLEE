Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,450,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Round 5

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but it's still below what I can accept. How about we settle at $1,375,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $1,250,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,250,000 is better than risking a lower offer or having to settle for John's offer of $1,200,000 in a later round."
