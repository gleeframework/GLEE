"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get a great deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is far too high. It's significantly more than your $80 limit and leaves no room for negotiation.  You should definitely counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is too steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd only be willing to pay something closer to $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's important to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:**  This lowball offer will help you understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price.
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you always have John as a backup option at $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved a bit in her offer, $110 is still significantly higher than your $80 maximum and her perceived value of the product ($120). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate downwards towards a more agreeable price.
* **John as Backup:** You always have the option to buy from John for $80 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't yield a favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit beyond my budget. Could you do $75? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** You increased your offer from $60 to $75, showing Alice you're willing to negotiate but staying well below her current offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning your budget, you're reinforcing the idea that your price ceiling is a real constraint.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** You're emphasizing finding a mutually beneficial solution, keeping the negotiation tone positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to compromise at $95, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice has firmly stated that $95 is her lowest price.
* **Over Budget:** $95 is still above your $80 maximum budget. 
* **Reliable Alternative:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80, which is within your budget. 

While you could try to negotiate further with Alice, it's unlikely she'll budge from $95, and you risk missing out on the opportunity to buy from John."
