Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I think $850,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me.

```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting very close to my minimum price, but I'm running out of time.  I've already rejected Bob's offer twice in a row, and there's only one round left. If I reject his offer again, there's a good chance he'll walk away, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a safe and guaranteed sale."
