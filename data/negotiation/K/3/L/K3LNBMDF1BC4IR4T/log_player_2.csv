"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $125. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

You're trying to save as much money as possible. $125 is still above your $100 limit. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is closer to your limit, you're still trying to save as much as possible.  It's worth seeing if you can push Alice down further."
