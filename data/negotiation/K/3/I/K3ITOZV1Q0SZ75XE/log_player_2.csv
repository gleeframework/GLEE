Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply too far below my minimum asking price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000. This still gives you a significant advantage, and it's a price I can comfortably accept.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I understand your budget constraints, $700,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still too far from my minimum.  Let's split the difference.

Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that makes sense for you. She's still significantly over your budget, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from your backup."
