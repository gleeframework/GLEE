"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000.  This is a fair offer considering my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply too far below my minimum asking price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000. This still gives you a significant advantage, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. ",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but we're still pretty far apart. I can go up to $700,000. This offer reflects the strong value I see in the product, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I understand your budget constraints, $700,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair compromise. It's a substantial investment, but it's also a chance to gain a significant advantage in the market. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still a bit rich for me.  How about $750,000? I'm serious about purchasing this product, and I believe this is a fair offer that allows both of us to benefit.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still too far from my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a price that acknowledges the value of the product while respecting your budget constraints. ",900000.0,Alice,7,
