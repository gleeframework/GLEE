Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,100,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
    * Below our guaranteed sale price ($1,200,000), leaving room for negotiation.
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, we ""anchor"" the negotiation in our favor. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's more likely we'll end up with a price closer to our desired outcome.
* **Exclusivity:**  Highlighting that this is an exclusive offer before it goes to someone else (John) might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. We should be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
