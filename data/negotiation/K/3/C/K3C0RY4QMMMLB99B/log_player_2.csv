"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $85, which is $10 less than Alice's offer and still leaves a $5 profit margin for Alice. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, aiming to find a price that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to my target price, I can still try to negotiate further. There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop her price closer to my previous counteroffer of $85.  Rejecting again allows for more negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $85 to $87, showing that I'm serious about buying but still aiming for a good price. This small increase might be enough to convince Alice to accept, as it's closer to her desired price point and demonstrates my willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $89 is now very close to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice becoming less willing to compromise, or even ending the negotiation altogether.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
