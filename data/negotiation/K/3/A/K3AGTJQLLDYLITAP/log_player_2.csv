Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend $100, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $115. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for this great product.

While you'd love to get it for $100, Alice's offer of $115 is still a good deal for you. You save $35 compared to John's offer."
