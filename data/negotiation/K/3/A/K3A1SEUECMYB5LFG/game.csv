"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit steep for me. Could you do $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $12,000 is pushing it. Let's make this our final offer: $15,000 and we have a deal.",15000.0,Alice,5,
