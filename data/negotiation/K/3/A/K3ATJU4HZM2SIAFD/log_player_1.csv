{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $15,000. It's a real steal, and I'm confident it's worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but I'm leaving room for negotiation. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by implying that the product is in high demand.  

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $12000 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than $12,000 to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $13,500? That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and still a fair price for a product like this. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has been firm on his offer of $12,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $12,000 is still a decent profit and higher than my minimum.  It's likely that further negotiation with Bob will only lead to more back-and-forth, and there's a chance he could walk away.  

It's time to close the deal and secure the $12,000."
