"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a bit higher than my minimum, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I want to gauge his interest and leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $80, but I'm also not ready to sell to John yet. I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I hope Bob will find it acceptable."
