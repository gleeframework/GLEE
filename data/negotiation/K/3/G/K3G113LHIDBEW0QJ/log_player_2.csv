# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you can buy the product from John for $800,000, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer of $850,000 and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $825000? This still allows me a good return on my investment while giving you a better price than my initial offer. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to you, and I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer of $825,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's better to continue negotiating with Alice, as you might be able to get a price closer to your target of $800,000."
