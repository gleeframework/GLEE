"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $850000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",775000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $825000? This still allows me a good return on my investment while giving you a better price than my initial offer. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to you, and I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $800000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for you as well.",800000.0,Bob,4,
