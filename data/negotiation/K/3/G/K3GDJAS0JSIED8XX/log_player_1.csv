Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, based on my assessment of its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal.

We are still significantly above John's offer. Let's see if we can push Bob a bit further."

This is a great offer! It's above our fallback option with John, and continuing to negotiate has a very small chance of a significantly better outcome.  We should take the deal."
