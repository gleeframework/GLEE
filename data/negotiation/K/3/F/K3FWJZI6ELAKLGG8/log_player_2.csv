"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's starting price is higher than both her value and John's offer. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation and gauge her flexibility.
* **Strategic Positioning:** My offer is slightly above Alice's product value ($8,000), aiming to entice her while still leaving me space to negotiate upwards. 
* **John as Leverage:**  I haven't revealed my willingness to pay up to $12,000. John's offer provides a backup plan, allowing me to walk away if Alice doesn't budge enough."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room:** While Alice met me halfway, the price is still above her value. There's room for further negotiation.
* **Incremental Progress:**  Alice reducing her price significantly suggests she's motivated to sell. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I can continue to push for a better deal, knowing I have John's offer as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm getting closer, but $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm suggesting a price that splits the difference between my last offer ($7,000) and Alice's current offer ($8,500). This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming lower.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** I'm avoiding large jumps in my counteroffers to keep the negotiation moving and signal that I'm seriously considering the deal.
* **Time as a Factor:** Each round brings me closer to potentially accepting John's offer. My counteroffers aim to reach a favorable agreement with Alice quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Limit:** Alice has come down considerably and is now only $200 above her value for the product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks her walking away or offering a price closer to John's.
* **Good Deal:**  While I could potentially get it for slightly less, $8,200 is a significant savings compared to John's $12,000 offer."
