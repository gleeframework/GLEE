Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $130. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay anything below that.
* **Your Minimum:** You're secure knowing you can sell to John for $80, so that's your absolute floor. 
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price closer to Bob's maximum allows room for negotiation if needed.  
* **Justification:** The message aims to be persuasive without revealing your minimum, suggesting the price is based on the product's value.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. There are other valid approaches depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a deal with Bob."
