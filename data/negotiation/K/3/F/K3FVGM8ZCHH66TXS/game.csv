"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference at $13,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,250, which is a fair compromise and a step closer to your price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13250.0,Bob,4,
