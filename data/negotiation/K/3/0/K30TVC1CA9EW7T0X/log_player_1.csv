"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This allows for some room to negotiate while maximizing my potential earnings.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to him to hopefully incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my valuation of the product. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price. I still have time and rounds to negotiate.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,800.  This is a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway with my counteroffer. I'm dropping the price slightly to show flexibility but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer and the benefits for Bob."
