"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold opening move, but I believe it's necessary to get the best possible price for the product, which I value at $1,500,000. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate, but I'm prepared to walk away if his offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it right away. I believe I can potentially get a higher price, especially since I have 8 more rounds to negotiate. I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,750,000.  This is a compromise, but it still allows me to get a price closer to my initial target. I want to leave some room for negotiation in the remaining rounds, but I don't want to lose too much ground too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good deal. It's above my minimum of $1,500,000 and leaves me with some profit. With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal by trying to squeeze out more money.  It's time to accept his offer and close the deal."
