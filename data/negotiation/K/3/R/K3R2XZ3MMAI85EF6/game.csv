"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $1400000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can see the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1600000. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1600000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $1500000?  That's my absolute top price, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1500000. I'm willing to come down to $1650000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,
