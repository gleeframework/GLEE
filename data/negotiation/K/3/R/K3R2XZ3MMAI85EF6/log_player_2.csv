Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can see the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1600000. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $1,500,000?  That's my absolute top price, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1500000. I'm willing to come down to $1650000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
