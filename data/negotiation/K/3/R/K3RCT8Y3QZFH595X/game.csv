"Alice,  $1400000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1200000. Would you be willing to consider $1300000?  I'm very interested in your product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1300000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price, and I believe it's fair considering your interest in the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
