"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very useful. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can do better than $140.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a little, but $130 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

You are still in a better position to negotiate a lower price than $135.  You can continue to try and bargain with Alice."
