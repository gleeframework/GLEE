"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's an exceptional opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $950,000 for you to acquire this valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but I can likely get a better price. There are 9 more rounds, and I have the option of buying from John for $1,000,000 if I don't get a better deal with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows me to see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is great, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. It's a bold move, but it demonstrates my serious interest in the product while also making it clear I'm not willing to overpay.  This could make Alice more willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'm not in a rush, and I have the option to buy from John.  By rejecting this offer, I can continue to try and push for a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $820,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's getting closer to where I need to be. "", ""product_price"": 820000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still pushing for a lower price, but I've increased my offer slightly. This shows I'm willing to compromise but I'm also not going to settle for anything unreasonable.  I'm hoping this will make Alice realize that we're close to a deal, and she might be willing to accept."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $830,000. This is a good price for me. I can purchase the product for less than what John is offering, and I'm saving a significant amount of money from Alice's initial offer. It's time to accept this deal and move forward."
