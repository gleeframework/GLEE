"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Being polite:**  Using a friendly tone and acknowledging Bob's perspective helps build rapport and increases the chances of a successful negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not asking for the full $900,000 right away, leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Important note:** This is just a starting point. The actual negotiation strategy will depend on Bob's response and how the conversation unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.**  I won't settle for $700,000 when I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me.
* **I'm not ready to sell to John yet.**  There are still more rounds of negotiation with Bob, and I believe I can potentially get a better price from him. 

**Next steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle while still protecting my bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $750,000. This is still a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $850,000 to $750,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning and justification:** I'm not just throwing out a number. I'm explaining why $750,000 is a fair price, appealing to Bob's sense of logic.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm staying polite and positive, encouraging a continued dialogue. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a gradual compromise, hoping to reach a price point that's acceptable to both of us. If Bob still refuses, I'll adjust my counteroffer again in the next round. However, I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, so I'll need to carefully consider my next steps."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $680,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's closer to my desired range, it's still too low considering the value of the product to both of us. 
* **I'm not ready to sell to John yet.** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, especially since I'm only in round 4 of the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll try to be firm but fair, aiming for a price that is both acceptable to me and within Bob's budget. I'll need to carefully consider my options, as I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the more favorable choice."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for us. While I appreciate your offer, $680,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $720,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price acknowledges your budget while still reflecting the true value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 720000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise, but with a firm stance:** I'm lowering my price again, but only to $720,000. This shows willingness to compromise but also firmness in my position. 
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, subtly emphasizing that he's getting a good deal. 
* **Positive and hopeful tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation positive and encouraging a deal. 

**Strategy:**

I'm inching closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not willing to go below $720,000.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to carefully consider whether to sell to John or keep negotiating with Bob. However, I'm hoping that with a slightly lower price and a positive approach, I can secure a deal with Bob in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $720,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm thinking more along the lines of $690,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $690,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $690,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  While it's a small increase from the previous round, $690,000 is still too low for me considering the product's value. 
* **I'm not ready to sell to John yet.** I'm only in round 6, and there's still room for negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. I'll aim for a price closer to $720,000, but I'll need to carefully consider my options and potential risks.  If Bob continues to refuse, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John. However, I still believe I can secure a better price from Bob with persistent negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I understand you're committed to $690,000, but I'm still not comfortable going below $710,000. It's a small difference, but it reflects the value I'm placing on the product and the effort I've put into making this deal work. I believe this price is fair to both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 710000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm lowering my price slightly from $720,000 to $710,000, showing flexibility while still maintaining a firm stance. 
* **Emphasizing value and effort:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and highlighting my commitment to the negotiation.
* **Positive and persuasive language:**  I'm using language that emphasizes fairness and encourages Bob to see the value in closing the deal at this price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price and hoping that with a smaller compromise and a positive approach, I can convince Bob to accept the offer.  If he rejects it, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round, but I'm still hopeful that we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $680,000. I've done my research, and I believe that's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **We're running out of time.** We're in round 8, with only two rounds remaining.
* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  He's stuck at $680,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **I'm close to my minimum.** I'm only $20,000 away from my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not confident that Bob will budge any further.
* **Risk of further negotiation.** There's a risk that continuing the negotiation with Bob will result in him lowering his offer again, making it even less attractive.

**Conclusion:**

Given the limited rounds remaining and the risk of getting a worse deal, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $800,000. While this is not the ideal price, it's a secure and guaranteed deal that meets my minimum requirements."
