,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $750,000. This is still a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for us. While I appreciate your offer, $680,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $720,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price acknowledges your budget while still reflecting the true value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",720000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand you're committed to $690,000, but I'm still not comfortable going below $710,000. It's a small difference, but it reflects the value I'm placing on the product and the effort I've put into making this deal work. I believe this price is fair to both of us.
