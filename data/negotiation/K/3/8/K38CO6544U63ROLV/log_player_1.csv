{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! I believe it's a valuable asset that will benefit your business greatly.  My asking price is $1,450,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a little too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This seems like a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go right now. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $1,350,000 is above my minimum acceptable price and it's getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds. It's in my best interest to secure the deal before the possibility of selling to John becomes more appealing."
