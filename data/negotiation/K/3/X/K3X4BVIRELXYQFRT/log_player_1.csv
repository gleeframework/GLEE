Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$140:** This is a starting point that is above my minimum value of $120 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **""Message"":** This is a friendly and encouraging message, making Bob feel valued and prompting him to consider the offer. 

This offer is designed to:

* **Maximize profit:** It's close to Bob's maximum value, leaving room for negotiation but still offering a substantial profit for me.
* **Keep negotiations open:**  The message keeps the door open for further discussion,  ensuring Bob doesn't feel pressured and encourages counteroffers. 
* **Maintain a positive relationship:** A friendly tone helps maintain a positive relationship with Bob, which could be valuable in future interactions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum value of $120.**  This makes it a profitable deal for me.
* **The negotiation seems to be progressing, and I might be able to get a slightly higher price in the next round.** However, there's a risk of Bob getting frustrated and walking away entirely.
* **Selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed option, but it's less profitable than accepting Bob's offer.** 

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this stage. It secures a good profit while maintaining a positive relationship with Bob, potentially allowing for further negotiations in the future."
