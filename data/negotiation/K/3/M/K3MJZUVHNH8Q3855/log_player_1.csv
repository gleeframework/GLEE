Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll go much higher than $13,000. At this point, the potential profit gained by continuing negotiations with Bob is outweighed by the guaranteed $15,000 John is offering.  It's time to cut my losses with Bob and take the sure thing."
