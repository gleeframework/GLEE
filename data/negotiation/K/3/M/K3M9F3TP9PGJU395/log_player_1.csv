"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value for the product is $80. I'm hoping to get a good price from Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a slightly better price from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm countering with $95.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I believe this price is still fair, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting it."
