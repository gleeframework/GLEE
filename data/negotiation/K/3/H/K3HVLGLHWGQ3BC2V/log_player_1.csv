Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The $19,000 offer is a starting point.  If Bob counters, you can potentially still meet a price that's above your minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** The message aims to convey value and encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously, even if it's initially higher than he might expect. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  It's unlikely Bob will accept an offer significantly higher than his perceived value ($10,000). 
* **Negotiation Skills:**  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. Knowing when to hold firm and when to make concessions is key."
