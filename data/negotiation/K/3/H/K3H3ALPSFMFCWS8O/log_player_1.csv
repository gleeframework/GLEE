Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what I'd get from John. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a profit beyond my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering $140, which is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my price for John. This shows willingness to negotiate while also aiming for a profit closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is too low for me. While I could keep negotiating, it's likely we won't reach a price I'm comfortable with.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum and allows me to move on."
