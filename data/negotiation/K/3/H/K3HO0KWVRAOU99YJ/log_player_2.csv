Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,500 is still significantly below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  Let's settle on $9,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it will allow me to make a reasonable profit.  If you're not interested in this final offer, I'll have to move on to other options.
