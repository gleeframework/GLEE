Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. If Bob accepts, you get significantly more than your minimum.
* **Leave Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,100,000 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle above your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **John as Leverage:**  While not explicitly stated, implying you have other interested buyers (like John) can subtly encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Politeness and Justification:** Framing the offer politely and justifying the price based on ""value"" makes it more appealing than a blunt demand."
