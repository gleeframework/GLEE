"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $100 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we settle on $150? That's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
