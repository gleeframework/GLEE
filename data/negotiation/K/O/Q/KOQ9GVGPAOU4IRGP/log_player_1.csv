"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counter-offers, but also establishes a starting point that reflects the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for $10,000, as it's significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000. I'll counter-offer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $17,000. This is still above my minimum value, but shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  It's also a significant step up from Bob's offer, hopefully prompting him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum value.  While I'd prefer more, it's a fair deal and avoids risking a further negotiation.  I'm also getting closer to closing the deal, which is important."
