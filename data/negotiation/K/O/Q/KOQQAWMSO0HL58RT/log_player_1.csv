Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be particularly valuable to you. I'm asking for $140. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Create a Sense of Exclusivity:**  Mentioning that you're offering it to him before a public listing might make Bob feel like he's getting a special deal. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
