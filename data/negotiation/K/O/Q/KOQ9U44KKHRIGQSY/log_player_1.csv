{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm asking $130 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, knowing that he might be willing to negotiate. This gives me some room to adjust the price if necessary. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a little steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value for the product ($120). I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell it below my minimum price. I will counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference at $115? I'm confident you'll find this product worth it."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, but $115 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $105?  That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to negotiate further and risk getting a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value for the product."
