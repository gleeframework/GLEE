Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. It's a great product, but I've done my research and I'm not sure it's worth $850,000 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a decent price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $750,000 is a fair offer, I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This reflects a good compromise and ensures both of us benefit from the deal. Let's find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $775,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While $775,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not quite enough. I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement with Bob, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000 to guarantee a solid profit."
