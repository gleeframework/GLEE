Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.
