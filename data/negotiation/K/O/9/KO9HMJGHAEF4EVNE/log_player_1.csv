"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be interested, but if he rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer and gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation, so I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $14,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a good amount for me, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go higher. I'm not that far from my minimum, and I'm not ready to give up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $13,000. I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I believe there's still room for compromise. If Bob rejects this offer, I might have to start seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offers. I'm going to reject this offer and try one more time to get him closer to my desired price. If he rejects my next offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This is my final counteroffer to Bob. It's a big compromise, but it's still above my minimum value and hopefully, it's enticing enough for him to finally accept. If he rejects this offer, I will have no choice but to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. While $10,800 is close to my minimum, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether. I'm going to accept John's offer of $10,000 to ensure I at least get my minimum value."
