"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a favorable deal.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""return on investment"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language implies willingness to negotiate, setting the stage for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is tempting, it's still a significant margin below his perceived value of $1,000,000. We have room to negotiate. Rejecting this offer signals that we're aiming for a better deal and keeps the negotiation open.  We're still above our safety net of $800,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. This reflects the true worth of what you're getting."",
""product_price"": 920000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a reasonable concession ($30,000) to show flexibility and keep Bob engaged, but not too large that we undervalue the product.
* **Reiterating Value:**  We're subtly reminding Bob of the product's high value to him, reinforcing its worth and justifying the price.
* **Maintaining Firmness:**  The counteroffer remains significantly above both Bob's offer and our fallback option of $800,000 from John. This demonstrates our confidence in the product's value and our aim for a strong deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $870,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, but Bob is still incrementally increasing his offer. We need to signal that we're looking for a more substantial jump if he wants the deal. Rejecting keeps the pressure on and allows us to counter with a figure closer to our target. We're still above our $800,000 safety net."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  To show you I'm serious about making this work, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair and mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Calculated Concession:**  We're making a more substantial concession of $20,000 this time. This shows Bob we're flexible and eager to close the deal but still maintains a strong position above our minimum.
* **Finality and Urgency:** The language implies this is a significant move on our part and might be one of our final concessions. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act.
* **Positioning for Acceptance:** By framing $900,000 as a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" we're nudging Bob towards accepting this offer as a win-win for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $880,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept Bob's offer of $880,000. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but the pace is slowing.  We might only squeeze out another $10,000-$20,000 at most.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now gives us access to the funds sooner, which has its own value (we could invest it, etc.).
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Pushing Bob too hard risks him walking away altogether, leaving us with John's offer of $800,000. 

Accepting at $880,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the potential downside of continued negotiation."
