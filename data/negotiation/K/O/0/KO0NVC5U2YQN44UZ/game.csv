"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $13000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,
