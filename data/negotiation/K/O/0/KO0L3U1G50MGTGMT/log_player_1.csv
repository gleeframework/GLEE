"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price that is significantly above my minimum ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the value to Bob, reminding him that he'll be getting a good deal. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, starting the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still lower than I'd like to get. I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **Going for more:**  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price range in the next round. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John for $80 is the last resort, and I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is tempting, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $100? It's still a great value for you, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still aiming for a higher price. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob and reminding him of the good deal he's getting.
* **Staying firm:** I'm not conceding too much, but I'm leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $95. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the deal:** Bob's offer of $95 is a good compromise, considering it's very close to my previous offer of $100.
* **Maximizing profit:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, accepting $95 is still a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation.
* **Avoiding risk:** There's a chance Bob might further lower his offer in the next round, potentially leading to a worse deal or a stalemate. 
* **Time is money:** With limited rounds, it's important to close the deal when a fair offer is on the table."
