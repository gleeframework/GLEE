"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1,200,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 simply isn't enough for me to let this product go.  It's truly a unique and valuable asset, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a significant discount while still ensuring I get a reasonable price.  Let's try to reach an agreement so we can both benefit from this opportunity.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still out of my range. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's find common ground here.",850000.0,Bob,4,
