"Alice, $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for this product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10500? This feels fair to both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is still a bit above your target, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can include a 1-year warranty and a free consultation with our expert team. This way, you'll get even more value out of the product. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $11000.",11000.0,Alice,5,
