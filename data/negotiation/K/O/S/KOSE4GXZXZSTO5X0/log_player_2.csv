"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a fantastic product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100. 
* Alice is offering it for $90, which is less than your value. 
* While you could get it from John for $100, accepting Alice's offer saves you $10."
