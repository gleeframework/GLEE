"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. It's still a great deal for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the quality and value you'll get.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $13,500 is still a little steep for me.  How about we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $12,800. It's getting close to my minimum, but I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,5,
