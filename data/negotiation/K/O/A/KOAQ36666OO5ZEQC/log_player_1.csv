"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning the product being a ""great fit"" subtly emphasizes its worth. 

This strategy aims to:

* Get Bob thinking about the value of the product.
* Open a negotiation space where I can potentially secure a higher price. 
* Leave room for adjustments in the following rounds if Bob's counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000).**  Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **I have 9 rounds left.**  There's ample opportunity to continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John. 

**My strategy is to:**

* Reject Bob's offer.
* Counter with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a middle ground.  
* If Bob's counteroffers remain too low, I'll eventually sell to John to avoid losing too much money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $8,500 is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while staying within my acceptable range.
* **Emphasize value:**  Mentioning the ""value of the product"" reiterates its worth and justifies the price.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly approach encourages Bob to continue negotiations. 

**Strategy:**

* **Test the waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's willingness to meet halfway.
* **Keep the door open:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have more room to adjust in the next rounds.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob's counteroffers continue to be unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While I think $8,500 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that be workable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.**  While it's closer than before, accepting it would still result in a significant loss.
* **I have 6 rounds left.** There's still a decent amount of time to negotiate with Bob or sell to John.

**My strategy is to:**

* **Continue negotiating with Bob:** I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can push him closer to my desired price point. 
* **Counter with a price closer to $8,000:** I'll try to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me.
* **If necessary, I'll sell to John:** If Bob's offers remain too low, I'll switch to John to ensure I get my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** Offering $8,000 shows a willingness to compromise and moves closer to Bob's offer.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** Framing the price as a ""fair compromise"" makes it more appealing.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  The message is upbeat to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Pushing closer to my minimum:** $8,000 is still a good profit for me, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Testing Bob's willingness:** This offer is a final attempt to get Bob closer to my desired price point.
* **Prepared to sell to John:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely switch to John to avoid losing too much money."
