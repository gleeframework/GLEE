"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but not ideal.** You're saving $500 compared to John, but still paying more than the product is worth to you.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can counteroffer at a lower price and potentially get closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within your budget and leaves room for negotiation.** Offering $10,500 is still below your maximum but gives Alice some room to negotiate. 
* **Starting point for negotiation.**  This counteroffer establishes a starting point for further discussion and shows Alice that you are serious about buying the product at a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price.** While it is slightly better than John's price, it's still not the best deal for you.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** By rejecting this offer, you can continue negotiating with Alice and try to get a lower price closer to your desired amount.
* **You have time and the option to buy from John as a fallback.** This gives you the flexibility to continue the negotiation without being pressured to accept an unfavorable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise offer:**  This offer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and your previous counteroffer. 
* **Shows commitment to buy:**  Demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to meet in the middle increases the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Leaves room for one more round:** If Alice rejects this offer, you can still buy from John or counteroffer one last time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is not favorable.** While it is lower than John's offer, it's still higher than your ideal price.
* **No more room for negotiation.** You have already made multiple counteroffers, and Alice has rejected them. It is likely that further negotiation will not result in a better price.
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing the negotiation process will take time, and you might not be able to get a better price than what John is offering.

**Conclusion:**  It's better to buy from John at $12,000 to avoid further negotiation and ensure you get the product within your budget."
