"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down closer to her product's value for her ($8,000)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's important to start low and work your way up. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly below Alice's starting point and closer to her product's actual value to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? I'm confident you'll find this a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above her product's value to her. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for further bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That feels like a good compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Targeting Alice's Value:** We know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice. Offering this price directly tests if she's willing to sell at her perceived value.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  We're moving closer to her price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  We're still below John's offer ($10,000), preserving that option if Alice remains inflexible."
