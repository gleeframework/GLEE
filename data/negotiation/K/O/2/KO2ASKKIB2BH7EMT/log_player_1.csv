Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it's highly valuable and you'll be very satisfied with it."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While I could start higher, aiming for the maximum profit might make Bob less likely to accept. A slightly lower price increases the chances of a quick sale.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, $90 is still a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $80.  

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
