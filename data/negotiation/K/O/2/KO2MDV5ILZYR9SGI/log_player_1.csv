"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to set a high bar initially to see how much negotiating room I have. If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to negotiate down from this price.  If he rejects, I'll reassess my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is more than my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering $8,500, which is halfway between my minimum of $8,000 and Bob's offer of $7,000. I'm hoping this shows good faith while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum. I'm happy to accept this, as it's my minimum target. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of success, and I'd risk losing the deal altogether.  It's best to secure the sale now."
