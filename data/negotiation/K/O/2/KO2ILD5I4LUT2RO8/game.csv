"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100. However, I'm still a little bit over budget.  $95 is the absolute most I can spend. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll take it. ",95.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close, Bob! I'm willing to give you a little more, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $95. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $98. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",98.0,Alice,5,
