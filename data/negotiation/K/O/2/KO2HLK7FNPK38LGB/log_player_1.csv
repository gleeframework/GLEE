{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where I'm aiming for a decent profit, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation.  I'm not going too high to risk losing Bob right away, but I'm not settling for my minimum price either."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is better than my minimum, it's still lower than the $13,000 I initially offered. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value, $11,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,250?  I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $12250. How about we meet in the middle at $12000? I'm willing to pay that price, but I don't think I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 isn't my ideal price, it's still a good profit and significantly better than selling to John for $10,000.  It's time to accept the offer and close the deal."
