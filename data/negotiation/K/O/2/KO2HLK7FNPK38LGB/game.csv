"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value, $11500 is still a bit lower than I'd like.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12250?  I believe this price is fair for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $12250. How about we meet in the middle at $12000? I'm willing to pay that price, but I don't think I can go any higher.",12000.0,Bob,4,
