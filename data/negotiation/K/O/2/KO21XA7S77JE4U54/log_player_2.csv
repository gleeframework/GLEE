"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I'm starting with an initial offer of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it offers. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value that you personally place on the product, which you mentioned is $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to acquire the product at a significant discount while also recognizing its true value. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,350,000 is within your budget of $1,500,000 and is a good compromise.  It's still a significant discount from her initial offer of $1,400,000 and gets you closer to the $1,200,000 that the product is worth to her. There's a good chance that you won't be able to negotiate a lower price without risking losing the deal, especially since you have the option to buy from John for a higher price."
