Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm asking for $1,200,000. What do  you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $1,200,000 offer leaves space for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than $800,000.
* **Justification:** The message highlights the product's value and positions it as an ""investment,"" subtly justifying the high price. 

**Important Note:** While this strategy aims for a higher profit, it's crucial to be aware of Bob's potential reaction. An excessively high offer might discourage him from negotiating altogether."
