{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still allows for some negotiation room.  It also signals that I am willing to compromise but not undervalue my product.  

If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I'll always keep John's offer of $10,000 in mind as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still leave room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,750. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum value of $10,000. While I'd prefer to get more, I'm starting to feel the pressure. There's a risk that if I keep rejecting, Bob will walk away and I'll have to settle for John's offer of $10,000.  It's a tough call, but I'm going to accept this offer to avoid any further delays."
