{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than Bob's perceived value ($15,000) to give him some room for negotiation and make him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This offer leaves me room to negotiate downwards if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **Keeping John as an option:**  This price is higher than John's offer, but it still gives me a good profit.  If Bob doesn't come close to my desired price, I can always fall back on John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $11,000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting his offer would result in a loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's initial counteroffer is low, it shows he's interested. I can try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. 
* **John is a backup:**  If I can't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob, I can still sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $13,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would give me a fair price for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:** I'm raising the offer slightly from my previous one, but still staying above my minimum price. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a good price.
* **Focusing on the value:** I'm highlighting that $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering the product's value to him.
* **Leaving room for flexibility:**  I'm still open to negotiating further, but this counteroffer puts the ball back in Bob's court."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close:** $12,500 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal, and there's potential for me to negotiate for a higher price if I make a counteroffer. However, I need to weigh that against the risk that Bob might walk away.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** If I reject Bob's offer and try to counteroffer, I risk losing him entirely. I can always sell to John for $12,000, but this is a slightly better offer, and it secures a sale.

**Overall:** Accepting Bob's offer is the most practical and risk-averse choice, considering my minimum price and the potential for further negotiation."
