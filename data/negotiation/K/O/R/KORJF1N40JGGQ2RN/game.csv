"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's a game-changer, and I believe it can be incredibly valuable for your business. My asking price is $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount from the value I place on it, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll reap. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can derive from it, and it's still a significant discount from your original asking price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a good offer, it falls slightly short of what I need to make this deal work for me.  Considering the exceptional value and potential impact this product can have on your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the significant worth of the product, but also demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's make this happen!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can derive from it, and it's a significant discount from your previous offer. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
