``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still ensuring a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll be closely watching Bob's response and adjusting my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob. I'll counter with a price that is closer to my initial offer, but still higher than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still much higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but it's the same as what I can get from John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob when I can guarantee the same amount right now. I'll sell to John and avoid further risk of losing value in the negotiation."
