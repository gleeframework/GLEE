"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This sets a strong initial price point and gives us room to negotiate downwards if needed. I'm hoping to get close to my minimum of $1,500,000 but also see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial valuation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with it. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if I can push for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. I'm going to counteroffer one more time to see if I can get a better price. I'm running out of rounds, but I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob's offer of $1,750,000. This is only $50,000 above my minimum, but with limited rounds left, I need to secure the deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm going to counteroffer one last time to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1720000}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm taking a calculated risk. I'm going to counteroffer with $1,720,000. This is slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but I'm hoping he'll accept given the limited time remaining.  It's a gamble, but I need to secure a deal that's closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's down to the wire, and while I'm not happy with Bob's final offer, it's simply too risky to continue negotiating. With no guarantee of a better price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum value. It's a bit disappointing to miss out on a higher price, but securing the deal and avoiding a potential loss is more important."
