Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. It's valuable and I'm looking for a quick sale. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he bargains. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, I know I could have gone even higher. If he negotiates, it means he's genuinely interested.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so there's no risk of losing money. This allows me to be more ambitious with my initial offer to Bob."
