"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a great compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, to be honest, $10,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $9,750? I think that's a fair offer, and it would allow us to reach an agreement quickly.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,750 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value you'll get from the product.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but to be totally frank, $10,200 is still outside my budget. This is a great product, but I need to be realistic about what I can afford. I'd be willing to pay $9,900 as my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I think I'll need to explore other options.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,900 is your final offer, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $9,900, which is $10,050. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value you'll get from the product.",10050.0,Alice,7,
