"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves some room for a good profit.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is now offering $1,300,000, which is lower than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is getting closer:** While Bob initially wanted a lower price, Alice has already moved closer to Bob's desired price. There's a chance that further negotiation might not lead to a significantly better deal.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob keeps rejecting offers, Alice might decide to sell to someone else. 

Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for a price that's better than what John is offering."
