"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

This is too high of a price.  We'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in your product, $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $1000000 is unfortunately below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? I'm confident this price still represents great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

We are very close to John's price, but we can still try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $1,150,000?  I'm sure we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1150000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1200000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is now the same as John's price.  It's not worth risking further negotiation to potentially get a lower price and risk losing the deal."
