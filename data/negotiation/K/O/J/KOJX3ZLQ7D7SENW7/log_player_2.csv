"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While the product is worth $8,000 to him, Alice's offer of $12,000 is still too high. Bob has a better option: buying from John for $8,000.  He should counteroffer Alice and try to negotiate a lower price, knowing he has a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  It's a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to me and you're still getting a good profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to make a profit. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $10,500 is better than her previous offer, it's still above his target price of $8,000. He has a guaranteed way to buy the product for $8,000 from John, making it a riskier move to continue negotiating with Alice.  Bob should counteroffer Alice with a price closer to his target, and if Alice rejects it, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price, considering it's worth $8,000 to me and it's closer to your previous offer.  Let's see if we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my need to make a profit.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's final offer of $10,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He has a better deal with John, who is selling the product for $8,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiations with Alice, as there's no guarantee she will lower her price further, and Bob might end up paying more than he wants.  It's a smarter decision to accept John's offer and secure the product at a lower price."
