"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it for $1500000. This is a significant discount, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1000000.  This is a one-time offer. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
