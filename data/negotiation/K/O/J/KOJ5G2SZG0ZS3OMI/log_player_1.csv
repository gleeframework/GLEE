Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and makes it more appealing to Bob, potentially earning you an extra $19. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is polite, highlights value, and encourages a prompt decision. 
 
**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value of $80. If you had more information, you might adjust your strategy."
