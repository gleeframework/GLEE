"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $11,500. This is a good starting point, as it's well above my minimum price of $10,000 and leaves some room for negotiation. 

I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate as he values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price just yet. I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $11,200. This is still a fair price, considering the product's value to Bob, and it's closer to my desired price point than his last offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not where I want to be. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I'm hoping that by being firm in my stance, I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $11,000.  This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, but it's still a significant amount above Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this will entice him to move closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to settle for that low of a price. I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. I'm willing to take the risk and continue negotiating."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $10,900. This is a small drop from my previous offer but is still a significant amount above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to show Bob my willingness to compromise and secure a deal. With only a few rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm still confident I can close the deal at a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time and the negotiation seems to be stuck. Bob's last offer was only $300 above my minimum price, and I'm not sure if I can convince him to go higher.  It's a difficult choice, but selling to John for $10,000 is the most sensible option at this point. It guarantees me my minimum desired price and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
