Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. How about $8,500? That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with some more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to profit.  Let's work together to find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $9,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's try $8,750.  It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $9,000, and with a few more rounds, I think I can convince Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close.  Let's try $8,900.  This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for both of us.  It's within your budget, and it gets me closer to my asking price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
