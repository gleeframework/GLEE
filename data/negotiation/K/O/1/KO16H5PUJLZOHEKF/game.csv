"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. How about $8,500? That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to profit.  Let's work together to find a price we're both happy with.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $9,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's try $8,750.  It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're getting close.  Let's try $8,900.  This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for both of us.  It's within your budget, and it gets me closer to my asking price. What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,
