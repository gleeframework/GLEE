Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  It's also a price that Bob might be willing to accept, as he values the product at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is only $5 less than my initial offer. Given that I can sell to John for $120, accepting Bob's offer for $125 is the best option in this situation."
