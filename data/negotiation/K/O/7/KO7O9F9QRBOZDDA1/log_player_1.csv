Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000.
