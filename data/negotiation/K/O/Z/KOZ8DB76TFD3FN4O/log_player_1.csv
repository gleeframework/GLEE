Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me a good margin above my minimum of $80, but it's still a reasonable price for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $90 is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum of $80. It's better to accept his offer than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with less."
