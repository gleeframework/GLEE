"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its potential, I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,150,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000, which is a significant amount and reflects the product's value.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
