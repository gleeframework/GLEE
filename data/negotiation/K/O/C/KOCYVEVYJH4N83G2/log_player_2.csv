"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of significant value to your business. I'm confident that it's worth at least $1500000 to me, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects that value.  I'm proposing a price of $2000000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits of this product. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I will reject Alice's offer. I think the product is overpriced and I can get it cheaper from John.
