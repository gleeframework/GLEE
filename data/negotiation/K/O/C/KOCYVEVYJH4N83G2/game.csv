"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of significant value to your business. I'm confident that it's worth at least $1500000 to me, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects that value.  I'm proposing a price of $2000000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits of this product. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
