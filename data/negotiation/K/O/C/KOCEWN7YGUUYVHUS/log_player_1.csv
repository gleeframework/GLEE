"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, I'm hoping he'll see value in it and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm reducing my price slightly to $140. This is still above my minimum acceptable price and hopefully close enough to Bob's offer to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds, but if we can't reach a mutually agreeable price, I'm prepared to sell to John and secure my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again to $130. This is still a reasonable profit for me, but also closer to Bob's offer, making a deal more likely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price, but it's also getting late in the negotiations. With only four rounds left, the risk of failing to reach a deal with Bob increases.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $150 from John and avoid any further uncertainty."
