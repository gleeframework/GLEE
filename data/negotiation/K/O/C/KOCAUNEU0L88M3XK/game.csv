"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,025,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,040,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. Let's try to reach an agreement before we run out of time.",1040000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,040,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering $1,030,000. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to reach a deal with you.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $1,030,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,035,000. This is my final offer. If we don't reach an agreement, I'll need to explore other options.",1035000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not comfortable going above $1,030,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000, but I need to be firm on this price. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here.",1030000.0,Bob,8,
