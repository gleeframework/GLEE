"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product.  Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the product. However, I was thinking of a price around $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and the return on investment you'll see.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,400,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our negotiation so far.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit under what I can accept.  To settle this quickly, I'm proposing $1,375,000.  This represents a significant discount from my original offer and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
