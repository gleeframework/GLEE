{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above your minimum but leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer. This strategy allows you to potentially get a higher price, while still leaving room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that you're serious about selling the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both a chance to make this work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $10,250. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is close enough to my desired price point and a better deal than selling to John for $8,000. I'll accept his offer to secure the sale."
