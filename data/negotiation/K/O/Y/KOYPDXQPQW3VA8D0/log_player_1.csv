Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its worth to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob and making it a ""deal"" to encourage him to consider it. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm making it clear I'm open to discussing the price.

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profits:**  I aim to get as close to my $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Keep Bob engaged:**  By being open to negotiation, I encourage Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain the backup option:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 provides me with a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum valuation of $1,000,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or at least secure a price closer to my target. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our valuations."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for us both to benefit. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:** I'm not going too low, as I want to maintain my bargaining power and ensure a good profit. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and framing the offer as a win-win situation.
* **Focus on compromise:** I'm emphasizing the ""meeting in the middle"" aspect to make the offer more appealing.

This strategy aims to:

* **Close the gap:**  By moving closer to Bob's offer, I increase the chance of a deal.
* **Maintain leverage:**  The offer is still significantly above Bob's initial proposal, so I maintain some leverage.
* **Signal willingness to negotiate:**  This shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching a mutually agreeable outcome."
