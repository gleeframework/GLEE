Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to maximize your profit, so aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer ($800,000) is key. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, offering it at $1,100,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation (if Bob tries to haggle) while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By framing it as a limited-time offer and emphasizing exclusivity, you create a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to accept quickly."
