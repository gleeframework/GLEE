Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that benefits us both."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as much money as possible.  While she has a guaranteed $12,000 from John, she can potentially get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting Alice closer to her maximum.
* **Appeal to Value:** The message highlights that the price is discounted and positions the offer as mutually beneficial. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale above Alice's minimum and avoiding a rejection that would lead her to John's offer."
