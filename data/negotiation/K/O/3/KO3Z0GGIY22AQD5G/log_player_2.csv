Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,000,000. Let me know if that's more in line with your budget.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think $900,000 is the lowest I can go. This is a good price for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down, she's still significantly above John's offer.  At this point, it's unlikely she'll reach a price that's significantly better than $800,000, especially with only 5 rounds remaining. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the deal with John."
