"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I want to negotiate, accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is considerably below its true value and potential return on investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's potential, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $1,025,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is now getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially negotiate him up slightly, accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk ending up with John's offer."
