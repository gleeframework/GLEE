"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. Would you like to make an offer of $12000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $12,000, and John is willing to sell the product for that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can get the same product for the same price from John."
