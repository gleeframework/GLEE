"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

 I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's still a great deal for you, given the product's value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,000. It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
