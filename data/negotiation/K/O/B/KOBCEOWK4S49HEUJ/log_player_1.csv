Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price. What do you think about [product_price]?"", ""product_price"": 150} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  This message is friendly and inviting, starting with a compliment to potentially get Bob interested.  It emphasizes the value of the product and then directly presents the price. 
* **product_price:** I'm starting at $150.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it's also a decent markup from my minimum value of $100. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Starts high:**  It's better to start with a higher price and potentially negotiate down than to start too low and leave money on the table.
* **Direct:**  It's clear and straightforward, leaving no room for confusion about the offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  It's open to discussion, allowing me to adjust the price based on Bob's response. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. How you actually negotiate depends on Bob's reaction and your understanding of the product's value to him."
