"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $1,300,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
