"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,600,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This price reflects the true value of this product and its potential to benefit you.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While your offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price point. Would you consider $1,425,000? I believe this reflects a fair compromise and recognizes the true value of this asset.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
