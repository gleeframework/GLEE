"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm only able to pay up to $10000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 10500}
