"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for sale. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's well above your stated value and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,750. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, while also being a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $11,750**, which is still below Bob's $15,000 budget.
* **Negotiating further might lead to a lower price**, but there's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers. 
* **The price difference between $11,750 and Bob's $15,000 budget is significant**, and accepting the offer will secure the product at a good price.

**Overall, it's a good decision for Bob to accept the offer and avoid further risks.**"
