"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable meeting you at $90. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too rich for my blood. I can do $95, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. I can meet you halfway at $107.50. That's the best I can do. What do you think?",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $107.50 is a bit too high. I can do $97.50, and that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",97.5,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can do $105, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really like the product. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I can do $98, and that's my last offer. Can you meet me there?",98.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $105, Bob. I think this product is worth more than that, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. That's my final offer. What do you say?",102.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made a serious offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $98. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from someone else. It's a great product, but I'm not willing to overpay for it.",98.0,Bob,10,
