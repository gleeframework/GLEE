"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation, which could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $12,000. Would you consider lowering the price to match my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I appreciate Bob's interest, his offer of $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to find a price that works for both of us.  
* **Exploring other options:**  While John's offer is attractive, I'm going to try to maximize my profits by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraint.  While I can't go as low as $12,000, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair deal"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Open to further discussion:**  I'm still open to further negotiation, signaling that I'm willing to work with Bob to find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is a factor:** We are already in round 4, and further negotiation could risk losing the deal to John or running out of rounds.
* **Potential for future business:**  Even though I'm accepting a lower price, this could lead to a potential relationship with Bob for future deals."
