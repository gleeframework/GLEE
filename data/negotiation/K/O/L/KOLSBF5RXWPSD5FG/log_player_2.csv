Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to do $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $87.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still aiming to get the price down, and Alice's offer is closer to your target but not quite there. You can continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  I'm still hoping to get closer to $85. Would you consider $86? "", ""product_price"": 86}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, so I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $88. It's the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you'd love to get it for $85, Alice has clearly stated this is her bottom line. You're already saving $12 compared to John's offer, and continuing to negotiate may risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting the offer is the best option to ensure you get the product while still saving money."
