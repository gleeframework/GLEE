Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,350,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $1,200,000.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John, it's better to take the safe option and buy from him at your desired price.  There's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate further with Alice and you risk spending more than you're comfortable with."
