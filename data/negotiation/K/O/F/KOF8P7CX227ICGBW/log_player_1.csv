Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $850,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I think this price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price given the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, it's unlikely he'll reach a number that surpasses John's offer.  I'd rather take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
