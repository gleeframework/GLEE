"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $850,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I think this price reflects the true value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price given the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
