"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $200. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I think $150 would be a fair price for the product considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer of $150 is tempting, I know John is ready to buy the product right now for the same price. There's no guarantee Bob will go any higher in future rounds, and I'd rather take the sure thing."
