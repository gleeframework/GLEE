Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $25,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, so let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 25000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $25000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $8,000 is far too low for the value I place on the product. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is just too low. How about we split the difference and I come down to $16,500? This still leaves me room to make a profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Is that more reasonable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to see if I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Is that more reasonable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum, and I'm starting to run out of time. It's better to secure the sale to John for $15,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob leading to a lower price."
