Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than his initial offer, it's still significantly less than what I need to get. I'm going to counter with a higher price to see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this product. This is a fair price considering the value it offers you. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,200. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,200 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offers, it's still not enough. I need to get closer to my desired price, so I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can convince Bob to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,200, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but $9,400 is the lowest I can go. This is a significant investment for you, and this product will provide you with substantial value. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,250, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,250 is a good price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get closer to my target price with a few more rounds of negotiation. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I'd prefer $9,400,  I'm willing to go down to $9,300.  This is a fair price for both of us. It allows me to make a decent profit, and it's still a great value for you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9300}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,300 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,150. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I'm disappointed I wasn't able to close the deal with Bob, I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are not worth the risk of continuing to haggle.  John's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to go lower."
