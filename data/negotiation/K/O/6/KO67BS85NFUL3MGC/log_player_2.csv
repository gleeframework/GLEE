Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $100, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $100, which is $105. I'll sell the product to you for $105.

```

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $105.  It's better to secure the product from John at $100 and avoid potentially losing the deal altogether if negotiations with Alice stall further."
