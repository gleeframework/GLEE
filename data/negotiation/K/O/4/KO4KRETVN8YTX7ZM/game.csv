"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While the product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,400,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Would you consider $1,100,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to drive a hard bargain. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're almost there. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 to get this deal done. That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to go up to $1,210,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can close this out now.",1210000.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,210,000, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last push to get the deal done. How about we meet at $1,280,000?",1280000.0,Alice,9,
