"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000 for it. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500. This still gives you a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product offers you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate hard, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to come down to $8,250, which is a fair price considering the value of this product to you. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your patience. I can tell we're both motivated to make a deal here.  To show you I'm serious, I'm willing to offer $8,000. I believe that's a fair compromise and a good price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,6,
