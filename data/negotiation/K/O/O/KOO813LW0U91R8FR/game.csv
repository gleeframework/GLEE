"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves room for profit for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
