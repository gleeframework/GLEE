"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. It's worth holding out for a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves room for profit for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I need us to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm running out of rounds. It's safer to sell to John at this point and guarantee a profit."
