"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Direct Offer:**  I've made a clear and direct offer, making it easy for Bob to understand what's being proposed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I am willing to pay $95 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($100).**  While it's close, I'm not willing to accept it at this stage. 
* **There are still 9 rounds left.** This gives me ample opportunity to negotiate further and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is a safe option, but I'm aiming for a better price.**  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about $105? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm adjusting my price down from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justifying the price:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Remaining firm:**  The price is still above my minimum acceptable price ($100), ensuring I don't undervalue the product. 
* **Open communication:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I would like to counter with $100 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum acceptable price ($100).**  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with a limited number of rounds left.
* **Selling to John would result in the same price.** It's not worth the risk of losing a potential buyer and potentially ending up with no deal.
* **Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and guarantees a profit.**  It's a good deal considering my time constraints and the risk involved in continued negotiation."
