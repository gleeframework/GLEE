Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $15,000 asking price represents a 50% markup, which is a significant but potentially acceptable increase for Bob if he values the product.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can always decrease the price, but you can't go back up after a low initial offer."
