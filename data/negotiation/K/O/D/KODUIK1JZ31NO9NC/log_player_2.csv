"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. $500,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. $300,000 is a big jump down from her initial offer, but it's a good starting point to see if we can find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $400,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my ideal price range. Let's see if we can get it lower by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly to $350,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly lower than her last offer. It's a reasonable middle ground, and hopefully, Alice will see the value in closing the deal at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but $450,000 is still too high. I'm going to make one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

I'm going to meet Alice halfway and offer $400,000. This shows good faith and willingness to compromise.  If she rejects, I'm going to start considering John's offer as we're running out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is back to her original price of $500,000.  With only three rounds remaining, the chances of a significant price drop are slim.  I've already made several counteroffers, and Alice is clearly not willing to budge significantly. It's time to cut my losses and purchase from John.  While it's not the ideal price, it's within my budget, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with no product."
