Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counteroffer at $8,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to close the deal, $8,000 is my minimum and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $9,500?  This would still be a fantastic deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a compromise we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I am unable to go above $8,000 for this product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

Bob seems adamant about his $8,000 offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  At this point, it's better to sell to John for $8,000 and guarantee a sale.  There's no guarantee that Bob will ever budge, and I'm running out of time with 6 rounds remaining."
