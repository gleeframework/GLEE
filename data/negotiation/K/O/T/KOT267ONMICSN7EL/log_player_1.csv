Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** While brief, mentioning ""fair price"" and ""value"" subtly implies the product is worth the asking price.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation open. 

If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can then propose a lower price, gradually moving closer to Bob's valuation or her own minimum price."
