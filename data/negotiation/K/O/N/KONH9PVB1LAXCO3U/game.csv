"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $12000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I've done some research and I think that's a more reasonable price for this product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you've done some research, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $11000 is a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $9500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $11500 for the product. I'm willing to work with you, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $11500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. I'll offer $9000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",9000.0,Bob,6,
