Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting us closer to our goal.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John, so we don't have to settle for less than $150.

By starting high but still within a potentially reasonable range for Bob, we maximize our chances of a profitable sale."
