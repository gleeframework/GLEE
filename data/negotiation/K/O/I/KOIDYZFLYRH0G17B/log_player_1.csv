"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Signaling that I'm willing to compromise shows good faith and encourages Bob to counter.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $150, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. There's potential to reach a mutually acceptable price in further rounds.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.  It also keeps John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $170.  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm explaining my counter-offer by highlighting the value of the product. This helps Bob understand why I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** I'm still open to negotiation, but I've shown I'm firm on a price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $170 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $155. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $155 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'm willing to accept this offer, I could potentially continue negotiating with Bob in future rounds to see if he's willing to go higher.
* **Time Constraint:** As I'm limited to 10 rounds, accepting this offer ensures I get a decent price without risking a lower offer in the future.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While John is offering $150, accepting Bob's offer nets me an extra $5, which is a small but worthwhile gain."
