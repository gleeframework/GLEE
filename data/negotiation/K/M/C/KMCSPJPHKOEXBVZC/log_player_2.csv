Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with the price. I can meet you at $114, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great value for the product, and I think you'll love it!

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're really close now, Bob! I can see you're willing to make a deal, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $114 is a bit of a stretch, but I can do $113.50. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product!

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John at $100.  He's already reached a point where the negotiations with Alice are getting very close to his limit, and he's only got a few rounds left.  Buying from John guarantees he gets the product at the price he's comfortable with, without the risk of further negotiation."
