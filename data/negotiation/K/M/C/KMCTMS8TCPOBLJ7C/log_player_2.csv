"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

You can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.  You want to save as much money as possible, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm offering Alice $10,500. This is a significant discount from her original offer and still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's a fair starting point considering the product is worth $10,000 to her and $12,000 to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $11,200 is still a good deal for me, as it's lower than John's price of $12,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer, and I might end up paying John's full price.  It's best to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
