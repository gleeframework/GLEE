Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $130 is higher than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** $130 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $150.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you have some space to bargain without jeopardizing your profit.

However, be prepared to adjust your strategy depending on Bob's reaction and your desire to sell quickly. If you're feeling impatient, you could go for a higher initial price. But if you're willing to wait, you could start lower and try to get closer to Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $120 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is better than selling to John for $100, it's still below your ideal price. There's room to negotiate further with Bob. 

You can counter with a price slightly lower than your initial offer, but higher than Bob's counteroffer. This shows you're willing to compromise, while also maximizing your potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference at $125? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go above $120. Can we find a middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $122 is still below your initial goal, it's very close to Bob's perceived value and likely won't change much in subsequent negotiations.  It's also significantly more than selling to John, making it the most profitable option at this point. 

Considering the back and forth, it's likely that further negotiation will take a lot of time, and might not yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting this offer allows you to close the deal and move on."
