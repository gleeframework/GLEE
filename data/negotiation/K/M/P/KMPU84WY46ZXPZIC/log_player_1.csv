Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting is significantly below what I believe to be fair.  I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This offer takes into consideration your perspective while still reflecting the true value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,600,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and takes into account the value I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a potentially acceptable range, we're still losing a significant amount compared to John's offer. We have room for negotiation and should try to push Bob a bit further before considering accepting or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  To show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to accept a compromise. How about $1,900,000?  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close, but Bob is consistently inching upwards.  We need to hold firm to see if we can squeeze a bit more profit. At this point, the difference between continuing with Bob and taking John's offer is substantial enough to warrant a couple more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, this negotiation has been productive, and I respect your approach. However,  $1,700,000 is cutting it too close. I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,825,000.  This reflects my bottom line, and I believe it's a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, but I need to be at or below that price to make the deal work for me. Can we meet at $1,750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go higher, and at $1,750,000, we're exceeding John's offer by a significant amount.  It's a strong price, and pushing further risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting now secures a good profit."
