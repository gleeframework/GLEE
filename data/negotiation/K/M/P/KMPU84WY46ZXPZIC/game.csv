"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting is significantly below what I believe to be fair.  I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This offer takes into consideration your perspective while still reflecting the true value of the product.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,600,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and takes into account the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  To show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to accept a compromise. How about $1,900,000?  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, this negotiation has been productive, and I respect your approach. However,  $1,700,000 is cutting it too close. I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,825,000.  This reflects my bottom line, and I believe it's a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product.",1825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, but I need to be at or below that price to make the deal work for me. Can we meet at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Bob,8,
