"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115.  This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still getting me a decent profit.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to push for something closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to $110. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum.  I believe this is a reasonable offer that could potentially get Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up a bit, and I'm starting to run out of time.  $108 is a decent profit and better than selling to John.  I'll accept his offer to secure the deal."
