"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a little below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's try to find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
