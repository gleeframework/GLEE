"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  However, $715,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to budge a little further, but I need to be closer to $725,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $720,000.  I'm confident this price is fair, and I'm ready to make a deal at that amount.  What do you think?",720000.0,Alice,5,
