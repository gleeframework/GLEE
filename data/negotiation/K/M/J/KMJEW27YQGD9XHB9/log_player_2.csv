"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Since you're limited to a budget of $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is at your maximum, there's no room for negotiation. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your limit, preventing any risk of a drawn-out negotiation or Alice rejecting a counteroffer."
