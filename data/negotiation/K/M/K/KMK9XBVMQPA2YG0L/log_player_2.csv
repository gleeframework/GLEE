{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target Price:** You aim to get the price down as close to your $120 maximum as possible.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** A $10 reduction from Alice's offer is a reasonable starting point.  It shows you're serious about buying but also willing to negotiate. 
* **Next Steps:**  If Alice rejects this offer, you'll need to assess how much further you're willing to go.  Keep in mind that you have a maximum price in mind, and there are only 8 rounds left."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  $100 is still higher than your desired price range.
* **Staying in the Game:** You've already shown a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down in price.
* **Strategy:** You have 7 rounds left, and you're closer to your desired price than when you started. It's worth continuing to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}

**Explanation:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** Alice's offer was $100, and your last counteroffer was $85.  This counteroffer of $90 is a reasonable compromise, showing you're willing to meet halfway.
* **Pressure Point:**  Alice has rejected two offers now. You're demonstrating persistence, but you're also getting closer to your target price.
* **Next Steps:**  The success of this offer depends on how much Alice wants to sell the product. If she rejects it, you'll need to consider how much further you're willing to go before resorting to John's offer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is on your side:** You have 5 rounds left, so there's still room to bargain. 
* **Potential for Improvement:**  You've shown a willingness to negotiate, and Alice has rejected three offers.  There's a good chance she'll be more receptive to a lower counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  Alice's offer was $105, and your last counteroffer was $90. This counteroffer of $95 represents a compromise, moving closer to her price but still within your budget.
* **Time Pressure:** You have only 4 rounds left, so the time for substantial negotiation is dwindling.
* **Assessing Risk:**  If Alice rejects this offer, it might be wise to consider your maximum price of $120.  Buying from John might be the best course of action if the negotiation isn't going in your favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  $110 is very close to your maximum price of $120. While you could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might refuse your counteroffer, leaving you with no deal. 
* **Time Constraint:** You only have 3 rounds left, and there's no guarantee you can secure a lower price within that timeframe.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small compared to the risk of losing the deal entirely.  It's more prudent to accept John's offer, ensuring you get the product within your budget."
