"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'm not interested in paying $20,000 for the product. That's way too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $14,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. Could you do $18,000? That feels like a fairer compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'm still a bit above my budget, and I think Alice is still not being flexible enough. I'd like to make another counteroffer to see if I can get a better price.
