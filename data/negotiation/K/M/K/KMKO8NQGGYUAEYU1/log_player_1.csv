Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $100. I think you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $100 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** It's important to remember that Alice has John as a backup buyer at $80.  This means Alice shouldn't go below $80, but it also means there's no need to be overly aggressive in discounting to Bob."
