"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending under $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is unfortunately still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to keep my expenses covered. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to be flexible. While $95 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $90 for the product? This would allow me to make a purchase without exceeding my spending limit.",90.0,Bob,4,
