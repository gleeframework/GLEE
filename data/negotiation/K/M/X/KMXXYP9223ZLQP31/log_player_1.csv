``` 

This is the starting point. I'm offering the product at my minimum price, hoping to get the full value.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your interest! $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $120?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  How about $100? That's a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

While $100 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
