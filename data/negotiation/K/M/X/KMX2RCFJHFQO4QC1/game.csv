"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a highly valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm intrigued by the product, $1200000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. This is my maximum offer.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I believe the product's value to you will far exceed that price in the long run. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1000000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer a final price of $850000. If we can't reach an agreement at this point, I'll have to move on to another seller.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $950000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product will bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,5,
