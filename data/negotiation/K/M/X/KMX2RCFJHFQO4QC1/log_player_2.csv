"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a highly valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is still too high for my budget. While it's closer to my maximum, it's still worthwhile to try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $950000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product will bring to your business.

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, even though it's closer than before. I'm confident that I can get the product from John for a lower price, so I'll take that option."
