Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting closer to that figure increases the chances of a larger gain.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** A slightly lower price than Bob's maximum allows room for negotiation if he counters. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 provides leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. A successful negotiation depends on various factors, including Bob's personality and negotiation skills."
