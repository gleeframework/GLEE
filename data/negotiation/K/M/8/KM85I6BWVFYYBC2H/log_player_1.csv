Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth significantly exceeds this amount for you in the long run."", ""product_price"": 950000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but it allows room for negotiation while still potentially yielding a higher profit.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By framing the offer as exclusive and time-sensitive, it might incentivize Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer. If Bob counters, I'm open to negotiation, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000 (due to John's offer)."
