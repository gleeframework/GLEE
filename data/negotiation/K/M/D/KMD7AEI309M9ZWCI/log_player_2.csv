Alice's offer:

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is asking for $110.  You're not obligated to take her deal, especially since there's a chance to get a better price by continuing negotiations.  You can try a counteroffer to see if she's willing to go lower."

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum price point ($100).  At this point, it's more efficient to simply buy from John and avoid further negotiation.  While there's a chance you could persuade Alice to drop her price further, there's also a chance that you'll get stuck in an endless negotiation loop.  It's better to be certain and go with John's offer."
