"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $105?  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $112.  That's still a fair price considering the value of the product, and hopefully, we can finally reach an agreement.",112.0,Alice,5,
