"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but allows me to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on this counteroffer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
