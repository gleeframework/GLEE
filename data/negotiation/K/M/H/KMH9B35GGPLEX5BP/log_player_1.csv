""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's room to potentially earn more from Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's higher value and the ""exclusive opportunity"" to entice Bob.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. If he counters, we can negotiate down towards his $800,000 floor while always keeping our guaranteed sale to John in mind."
