Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer.  By offering the product at $140, you leave some value on the table for Bob ($10), making it more likely he'll accept. This price also significantly exceeds your minimum acceptable price and John's offer."
