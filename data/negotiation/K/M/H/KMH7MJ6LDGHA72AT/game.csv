"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
