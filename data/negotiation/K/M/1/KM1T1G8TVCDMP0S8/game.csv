"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, $950,000 is a bit below where I need to be.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. I believe this price still represents a good value for you, and it allows us both to move forward. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your ongoing willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your budget constraints, I believe that $1,025,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
