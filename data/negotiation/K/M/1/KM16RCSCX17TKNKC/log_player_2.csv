# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can get the product from John for $8,000. There is no reason to accept Alice's offer of $10,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a lower price from her."

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still higher than what you can get from John for $8,000.  You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
