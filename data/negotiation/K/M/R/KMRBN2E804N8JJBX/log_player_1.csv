Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price close to your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. While Bob's perceived value is lower, this opening leaves room for negotiation and makes anything below $1,450,000 seem like a better deal. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" and ""significant return on investment"" aims to reframe Bob's thinking about the product's worth, potentially pushing his perception closer to yours.
* **Safety Net:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy.  Depending on your negotiation style and knowledge about Bob, other approaches might be more effective."
