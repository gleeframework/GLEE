"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great asset to you.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  How about $9,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still feel it might be a bit high. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $8,500? This would allow us both to feel satisfied with the transaction.",8500.0,Bob,4,
