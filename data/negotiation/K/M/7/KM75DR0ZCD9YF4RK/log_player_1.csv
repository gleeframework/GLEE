# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of your product, $1,350,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it, which still represents a significant profit for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
