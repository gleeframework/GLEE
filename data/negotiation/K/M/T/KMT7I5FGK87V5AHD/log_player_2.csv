"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. $9,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? That would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'd still be getting a great deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. This is a significant savings compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, Alice has already moved closer to his desired price. There's a risk that further negotiation could break down, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Compromise:** Alice is offering a compromise, splitting the difference between their previous positions. This shows a willingness to reach a deal. 

Accepting the offer minimizes Bob's risk and ensures a good deal."
