{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product,  $20,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, given its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? This price would allow us both to come to an agreement that feels fair."", ""product_price"": 14500}
