"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product,  $20,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, given its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I can come down to $17,000, which reflects the unique benefits this product offers.",17000.0,Alice,3,
