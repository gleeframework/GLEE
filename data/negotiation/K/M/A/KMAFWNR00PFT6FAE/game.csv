"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a fair price, it's a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  I'm open to lowering the price to $125.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think!",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $115. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I'd need to come down to $120. I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,5,
