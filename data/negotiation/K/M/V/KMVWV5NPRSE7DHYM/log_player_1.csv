"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $130, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $130, which is a bit higher than the product's value to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired $120 minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying I'm ""open to negotiating,"" I'm signaling to Bob that I'm willing to compromise, which might make him more inclined to accept a price higher than $120. 
* **Direct Approach:** I'm being direct and clear about the price I'm asking. This sets the stage for a straightforward negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Opportunity for better deal:** While Bob's offer is a starting point for negotiation, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can get closer to my target.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** Selling to John now would guarantee $120, but I'm hopeful of getting a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, I can't go as low as $110.  How about we split the difference and meet at $120?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a compromise by meeting Bob halfway. This shows good faith and might make him more receptive to a deal.
* **Clear and Concise:**  The message is direct and clearly states my counteroffer price, ensuring there's no ambiguity.
* **Focusing on Fairness:** I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the proposed price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  We're getting closer to a deal, and it's worth continuing the negotiation to see if I can push for a price closer to my target.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John would guarantee $120, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm not comfortable going below $118.  Would you consider that as a final offer?"", ""product_price"": 118}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession from my previous offer, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Final Offer Positioning:**  I'm framing this as a ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that I'm willing to work with him and that the product is worth the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I really like the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $118. Can you do $116 for me? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $116. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $116
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $116 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's only $4 away, which is a significant reduction from my initial asking price.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** There's a real risk that Bob will walk away if I reject his offer, leaving me with the less profitable option of selling to John.
* **Time Constraints:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, and continuing to push for a higher price could result in a stalemate or a long drawn-out process.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision in this situation. It guarantees a sale at a price that's acceptable and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
