"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to find a deal that's more in line with my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thanks for your revised offer, Bob! We're glad to see you're willing to meet us halfway. However, we're still not willing to go as low as $11,000. We're willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you at a price of $11,250. We think this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  While $11,250 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that's a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $11,100 for the product.  This is a small difference, and I think it's a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",11100.0,Bob,6,
