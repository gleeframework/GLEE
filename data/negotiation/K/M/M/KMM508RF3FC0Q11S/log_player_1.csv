Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob is interested, but still ensures I'm making a profit. If he rejects, I can lower the price gradually."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,350,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still leaves room for some profit and shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this price will be attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

Bob's offer is close to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's time to secure the sale."
