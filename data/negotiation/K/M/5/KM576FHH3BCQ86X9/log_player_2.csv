"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique and lucrative investment opportunity, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. You know John will sell it to you for $1,200,000, so you have some leverage to try and get a better price from Alice."
