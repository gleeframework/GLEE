Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll be ready to adjust if necessary, but it's a good starting point to see if Bob is serious about buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $13,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum.  John is offering me a guaranteed $12,000, which is a better deal than continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll choose to sell to John."
