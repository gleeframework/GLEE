"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $17,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $14,000? This price still offers you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise for me.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down on your price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $13,000. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for $14,000. This price still gives you a great deal, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  I'm open to discussing it further, but this is my final offer for this round.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand your position, and I'm willing to go a little higher. How about $13,500? This is a significant move from my last offer and puts us closer to a deal. I'm hoping we can find a compromise here.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  I'm feeling $13,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm ready to make a final compromise. How about $13,750?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to close this deal.  What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $13,250.  This is a significant move on my part, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!",13250.0,Bob,8,
