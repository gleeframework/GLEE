Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. However, she knows Bob is only willing to pay $10,000.
* **Finding a Compromise:** Offering the product at $11,500 creates a potential compromise. Bob gets a $1,500 discount from his perceived value, while Alice gains $1,500 more than Bob's initial valuation.
* **Backup Option:** Alice is secure knowing she has John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 if Bob declines. This allows her to aim slightly higher with Bob."
