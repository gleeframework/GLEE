Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate down, but still leaves you with a profit.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This shows you're willing to compromise, but also emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This starts the negotiation process and allows you to potentially adjust your price based on Bob's response. 

Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails. This gives you leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, which gives me leverage to potentially push for a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, I need to stay closer to $900,000 to make this work. Let's split the difference and go with $875,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and justification:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway, but also justifies the price with the value of the product.
* **Strategic price:** $875,000 is still above Bob's initial offer, but closer to his budget. It creates a possible win-win situation.
* **Continued negotiation:**  This keeps the negotiation open and allows for further adjustments depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $875,000. How about we go with $837,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $837,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome. This gives me leverage to push for a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still looking to get closer to my original price. Let's try $862,500. It's a reasonable compromise that would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 862500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter-offer:** This offer splits the difference between my last offer ($875,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000), showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a higher price. 
* **Justification:** I highlight the ""reasonableness"" of the compromise, further appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I am willing to negotiate, I am also aware of the alternative of selling to John, which gives me leverage to avoid accepting a price too far below my desired range."
