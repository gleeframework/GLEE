Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to reach a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for $11,000, as it's a fair price for both of us and within my budget. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm happy to consider $11,100 as a compromise. This would allow us to reach an agreement without needing further back and forth."", ""product_price"": 11100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my goal of $11,000 but offering a slightly higher price of $11,100 as a compromise. This shows a willingness to meet halfway, but also keeps the pressure on Alice to close the deal.  I'm confident that with a bit more negotiation, we can reach a deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11,100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,200. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me at this price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that this is her final offer.  While $11,200 is still above my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise, and it's getting close to my target. I'm confident that I can't negotiate a significantly lower price, and I'm happy to avoid further rounds of back-and-forth.  Also, buying from John would cost me significantly more, making this deal a better option."
