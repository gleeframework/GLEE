"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $11,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for $11,000, as it's a fair price for both of us and within my budget. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm happy to consider $11,100 as a compromise. This would allow us to reach an agreement without needing further back and forth.",11100.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11,100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,200. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",11200.0,Alice,7,
