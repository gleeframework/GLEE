Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,025,000. I propose a price of $962,500. Can you consider this offer?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable going above $962,500. I'm willing to meet you at $995,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000

**Reasoning:** Bob is very unlikely to go above $1,000,000.  While $995,000 is a good offer, accepting John's offer for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed higher profit and avoids further negotiation."
