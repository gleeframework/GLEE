"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think you'll find it's a steal at $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is way too high ($200). It's important to negotiate a much lower price.  I'd rather see if I can get closer to my budget by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is way more than I'm looking to spend.  I could do  $80. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low counter-offer  ($80) leaves room for negotiation. It's a common tactic in bargaining to begin significantly below your target price. This lets Alice know I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $140 is better than the initial offer, it's still above my $120 limit. I'll reject and try to negotiate further. There's room to meet closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, $140 is still a bit steep for me. How about $100? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer to show I'm willing to move, but $100 keeps me well below Alice's $140 and closer to my $120 maximum.  This keeps the negotiation going while pushing for a more affordable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $100.  Would you be willing to do $125? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is down to $125, and she's signaled this is her final offer. While it's slightly above my ideal price, it's close enough, and further haggling risks losing the deal. It's better to secure the product now than potentially miss out."
