"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($150) and above Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Message:** I'm framing the offer positively, emphasizing the value to Bob, to encourage him to consider it.
* **Leaving Room:** I'm not going all the way to my John offer ($150) yet, as there's potential for a higher price.  I want to see how Bob reacts to the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150) and leaves me with very little profit. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's counteroffer shows interest, there's still room to negotiate upwards. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I have the option of selling to John for $150, so I'm not desperate to accept a bad deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price given the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial $175, but I'm staying above my minimum acceptable ($150). 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using language that indicates I'm still open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, the offer is not yet at a point where it makes financial sense for me.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $150, so I'm not under pressure to settle for a lower price.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There's still a possibility of pushing Bob up to a more acceptable price, especially if I can convince him of the product's value. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price to try and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, and I appreciate your continued interest. However, $130 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135, which is a fair compromise.  I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm making a small compromise by moving down slightly from $140 to $135. This shows flexibility without significantly impacting my profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, hoping to sway him towards a higher price.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language and expressing confidence in the value of the product to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $135, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $132. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $132 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John's offer:**  I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150, so there's no reason to settle for less.
* **Negotiation space:**  I can still try to negotiate further with Bob. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him up to $135 or even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! While $132 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $134, which is a fair middle ground. Let's close this deal and get you your product."", ""product_price"": 134} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price again, but only by a small amount. 
* **Highlighting Agreement:** I'm emphasizing how close we are to a deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation constructive and encourage Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $134, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $132.50. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  
* **Low Profit:** While $132.50 is not a terrible offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and would leave me with a profit that's not ideal.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  John is a guaranteed buyer and is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price. 

I'm running out of time and the risk of not getting a better deal from Bob is too high. I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $150."
