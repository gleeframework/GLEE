{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is lower than what the product is worth to me, it's still too high. I want to try to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to what the product is worth to Alice.  This will likely be rejected, but it establishes my desire for a lower price and starts the negotiation process."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still too high, even though it's slightly better than her initial offer. I want to continue negotiating and see if I can get a price closer to $1,000,000. I have time and rounds left, so there's no need to rush into a deal that isn't favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want a deal that's beneficial to me. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable offer and start to move closer to my target price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high. It's actually worse than her initial offer! I'm not going to accept that. I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can get her to come down to a price that's more reasonable. It's still early in the process and I don't want to rush into a deal that's not good for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but only slightly. I'm trying to show Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to budge too much.  I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince her to start getting closer to my target price.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup option with John, so I don't need to settle for a deal that's not good for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a lower price.  I'm starting to feel like she might not be willing to come down to my target price, but I'm not going to give up yet. I still have a few rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer again, but this time I'm getting closer to Alice's last offer. I'm hoping that this will be enough to get her to accept.  We're only a few rounds away from the deadline and I don't want to risk getting stuck with John's higher price.  This offer is still below what the product is worth to me, but it's a compromise that could lead to a successful negotiation."
