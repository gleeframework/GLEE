Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Appealing to Value:** I mention the product is ""worth a lot to me,"" implying its value and potentially creating a sense of urgency or exclusivity. 
* **Fair Price:** I use the phrase ""fair price"" to suggest I'm being reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with ""Let me know what you think,"" showing I'm open to discussion and potentially a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've made a profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll move on to selling to John for $12,000.  I haven't lost money, but I haven't maximized my potential earnings."
