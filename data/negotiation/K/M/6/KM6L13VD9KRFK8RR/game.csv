"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1350000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1100000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll offer $1175000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1175000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting closer to my minimum price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm willing to make one last offer. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a premium support package. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1200000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not willing to go up to $1200000. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, and I'll also throw in a commitment to purchase additional products from you in the future. Can you consider this price?",1100000.0,Bob,10,
