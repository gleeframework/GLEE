,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant at $95. I'd be willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your continued interest.  While $92 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $94, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're ready to finalize the deal.",94.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still trying to make this work.  Let's compromise. I'll come down to $93, but that's my absolute bottom line.  If you're serious about buying, this is our last chance to make a deal.",93.0,Alice,7,
