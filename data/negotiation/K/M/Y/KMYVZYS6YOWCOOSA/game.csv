"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I'm asking for $1,150,000 to start. I believe this is a fair starting point given its value proposition. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the market value.  However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the unique aspects of this product.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,075,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
