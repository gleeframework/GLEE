{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,000.  Let's split the difference and settle on $12,750. It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 12750}

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
