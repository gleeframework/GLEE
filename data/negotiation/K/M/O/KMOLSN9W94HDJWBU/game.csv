"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you at a competitive price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, and I think $11,000 is reasonable. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close! I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. That's a fair deal for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I can accept. This is the price I initially mentioned as a starting point, and I'm willing to stick to it. If you're interested, we can finalize the deal.",12000.0,Alice,7,
