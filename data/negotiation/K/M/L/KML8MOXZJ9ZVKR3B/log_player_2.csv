"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you:** You value the product at $1,200,000 and Alice is offering it for $900,000. This means you're saving $300,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer is worse:** If you reject her offer, you'll have to buy from John for $1,200,000, which is the full price you're willing to pay. 

Therefore, it's in your best interest to accept Alice's offer and save the extra money."
