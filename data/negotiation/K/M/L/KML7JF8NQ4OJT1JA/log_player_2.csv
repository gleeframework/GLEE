"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so anything higher than that is a bad deal. By rejecting the offer, Bob can start negotiating with Alice and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should offer the minimum he's willing to pay, which is $1,000,000.  This is the price John is offering, so it's a good starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to drive the price down further.  He might be able to get Alice to match John's offer or come very close."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should offer a price that is closer to his desired price of $1,000,000 but still leaves some room for negotiation.  Offering $1,050,000 shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product but is also willing to pay a reasonable price.  This counteroffer gives Alice some incentive to accept, as it is still significantly lower than her previous offer and closer to her own valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stuck at $1,100,000.  Bob should keep rejecting her offer and counter-offering with prices closer to $1,000,000. There's a good chance he can get her down to his target price or very close to it.  It's worth the risk to continue negotiating, rather than buying from John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should continue to increase his offer, but only by a small amount. $1,075,000 is a good counteroffer because it demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price closer to his desired price of $1,000,000.  Alice is likely to find this offer more appealing than his previous one and might be willing to accept it."
