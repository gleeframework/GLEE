{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm going to start high, at my minimum acceptable price.  Since John is willing to pay that, I have no reason to settle for less right away.  If Bob rejects, we can negotiate, but I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,000,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a good amount for me and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a bit closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm going to stick with my previous counteroffer of $1,100,000.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my minimum, and we can finalize a deal.  If he rejects again, I might have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It seems like Bob and I are too far apart in our valuations.  He's not budging much, and I'm not comfortable going lower.  Rather than risk getting stuck in a long negotiation with an uncertain outcome, I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000.  This is the safest option for me to ensure I get my desired price."
