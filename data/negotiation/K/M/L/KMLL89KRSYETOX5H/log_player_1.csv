Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll be thrilled with it."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Know your worth:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less than that.
* **Start high:**  Beginning with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Project confidence:**  A confident tone might persuade Bob, even if the price is above his initial valuation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market research:**  While not provided in the prompt, understanding typical prices for similar products would inform a more realistic offer. 
* **Bob's personality:** If you knew Bob was a tough negotiator, a different approach might be necessary.

This strategy aims to maximize profit. If Bob accepts, you've secured an excellent deal. If he rejects it, you have the safety net of John's offer."
