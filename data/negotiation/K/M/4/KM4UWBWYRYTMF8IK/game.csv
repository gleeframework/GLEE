"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $15,000 represents the product's full value, I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to find a solution that works for both of us. This offer reflects the product's worth and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still staying within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
