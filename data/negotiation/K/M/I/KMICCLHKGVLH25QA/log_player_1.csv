Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly less than my minimum desired price. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, which could encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not going all-in with my minimum price, leaving open the possibility of a counteroffer and further negotiation. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** If Bob rejects, I can always turn to John and secure my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its perceived value to me. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I can likely push for a higher price, especially since Bob has already demonstrated his interest and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to explore potential counteroffers that could get me closer to my target.

**Next Steps:** I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between his offer and my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I need to be closer to $1,050,000 to make this work for me.  This still represents a significant value for you, and it's a price I believe is fair given the product's potential. Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my desired price:** My counteroffer is closer to my minimum price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position.
* **Focusing on value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, reinforcing the idea that the price is justified. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and collaborative to encourage further negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll wait to see if Bob accepts my counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate in subsequent rounds, always keeping in mind the option to sell to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to propose $1,000,000 as a compromise. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping the cost within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While $1,000,000 is still slightly below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, it's very close and represents a good deal for me.
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and eliminates the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price or a breakdown in talks.
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and potentially lead to a lower price or a sale to John, which would leave me with less profit.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer provides a solid outcome, allowing me to close the deal quickly and secure a reasonable profit."
