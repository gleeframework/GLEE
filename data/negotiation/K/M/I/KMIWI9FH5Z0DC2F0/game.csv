"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's on offer.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,500,000 is far beyond my acceptable range. Given my understanding of the product's value and my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This represents a fair price considering the potential benefits this product holds.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to move slightly from my initial price. Let's consider $1,400,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is still outside my comfort zone. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. ",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to the mark, it's still below my minimum threshold.  To be fair, I'm willing to consider $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it accurately reflects the value of this unique product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my part and represents the absolute maximum I can offer.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
