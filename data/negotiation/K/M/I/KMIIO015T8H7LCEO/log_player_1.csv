Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:**  $120 (this is what I would get from John)
* **Bob's maximum value:** $80
* **Negotiation range:**  $120 - $80 = $40
* **Strategic pricing:** Offering $110 allows me to make a profit above my minimum price while also giving Bob a good deal. 

This price gives me a higher chance of Bob accepting the offer, as he still gets a good deal compared to buying from someone else. It also allows me to make more money than selling to John."
