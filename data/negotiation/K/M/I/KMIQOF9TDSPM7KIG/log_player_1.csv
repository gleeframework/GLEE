Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$9,000 is too low, I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $14,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and still a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go any lower than $13,000.  This is a substantial product with real value, and $13,000 is a very fair price. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, to be honest, $13,000 is still pushing my budget. I could potentially make $11,800 work, but that's absolutely my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
