"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $14,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a reasonable compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go any lower than $13,000.  This is a substantial product with real value, and $13,000 is a very fair price. Let's close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, to be honest, $13,000 is still pushing my budget. I could potentially make $11,800 work, but that's absolutely my limit.",11800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? This is my final offer. Let's finalize this deal and get it done.",12500.0,Alice,7,
