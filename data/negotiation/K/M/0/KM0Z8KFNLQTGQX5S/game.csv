"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,500 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000 for a product like this. Would you be open to negotiating on the price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $7,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could you consider $8,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
