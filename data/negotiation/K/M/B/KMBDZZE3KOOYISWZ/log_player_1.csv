{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit while still being below Bob's perceived value of the product, making it more likely he'll accept.  It also leaves room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a good profit, I'm aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to my initial target."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, how about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a decent profit, it's still below my target and closer to John's offer.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try and secure a higher price closer to my initial target of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile.  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I can try to meet you in the middle. How about $1,025,000? I'm willing to stretch a bit, but I need to be careful with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a bit more, $1,025,000 is a significant profit and represents a good compromise.  Further negotiation risks losing the deal altogether and settling for John's lower offer of $800,000.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a successful sale and a decent profit."
