"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, how about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my limit.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile.  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
