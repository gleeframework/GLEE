"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds intriguing, but $1800000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, considering its potential value. This is the highest I can go at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant amount, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1600000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to pay $1400000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1500000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $1550000. This is the best I can do, and I hope it's something you'd be willing to consider.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
