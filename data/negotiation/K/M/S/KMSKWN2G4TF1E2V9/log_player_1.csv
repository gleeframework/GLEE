Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll start with a price that's a bit higher than that. Let's say I'll offer it to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $90}

This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $75 is lower than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($80), I'll choose option 2 and reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Since he was willing to pay $75, I'll try to get closer to my minimum price of $80. Let's say I'll offer it to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $82}

This is a bit higher than his initial offer, but still lower than my minimum price. Let's see if Bob will accept or make another counteroffer!"
