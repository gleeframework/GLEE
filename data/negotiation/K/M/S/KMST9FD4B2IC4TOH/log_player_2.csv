"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique item that I think you'll find very interesting. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at the maximum I'm willing to pay, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price, potentially saving some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is already starting to come down on her price, showing she's willing to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer again gives me a chance to potentially get an even better deal.  I'm still confident I can get a price lower than $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise, and it brings us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $1,075,000 is a price I'm comfortable with.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice becoming less flexible or even rejecting my offer entirely.  It's likely I won't get a much better price, and I'm running out of rounds. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product while saving a significant amount of money."
