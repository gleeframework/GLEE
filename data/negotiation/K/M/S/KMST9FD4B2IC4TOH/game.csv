"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise, and it brings us closer to a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a good compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
