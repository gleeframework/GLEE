Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its quality."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression the product might be worth more than Bob initially thought. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""limited time"" and ""quality,"" I'm adding a sense of urgency and value to nudge Bob towards considering the offer.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will indicate how eager he is to buy and how flexible he might be on price.
2. **Maximize potential profit:** If Bob accepts, I get a great deal. If he negotiates, I have room to lower the price while still aiming for above $150.

Importantly, I always have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price, ensuring I don't make a loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below both my minimum price ($150) and my initial offer. Accepting this would be a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially since I have John as a backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $200 might have been a touch high, but $80 is quite a bit lower than I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and show a willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial price.
* **Anchor Near My Minimum:**  By countering at $140, I'm anchoring the negotiation close to my lowest acceptable price while still leaving a small margin for further bargaining if needed. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me gauge Bob's flexibility. If he rejects this, I'll need to decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $140 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer increased by only $10 from his previous offer. This suggests he's not willing to budge significantly closer to my minimum price of $150.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from Bob. 

Selling to John for $150 guarantees my minimum acceptable profit and avoids further time and effort spent on potentially fruitless negotiations with Bob."
