"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, which I believe you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $100, and Alice is offering it for $90. While this is a discount, it's still above your ideal price. Since you can get the product from John for $100, which is your maximum price, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
