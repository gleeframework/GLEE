Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's position:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and that she has a guaranteed buyer at that price.  Starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation. 
* **Confidence and Value Emphasis:**  The message frames the product as highly desirable and worth the premium price. This can influence Bob's perception of its value.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Alice's offer anticipates a counter-offer from Bob. This gives her the opportunity to negotiate down towards a price that's still significantly higher than her minimum.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. Alice could choose a less aggressive opening price, but this approach maximizes her potential profit."
