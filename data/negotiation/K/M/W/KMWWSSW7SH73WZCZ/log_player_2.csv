Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $77. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $85. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $85.  Buying from John at $80 ensures the best price for Bob."
