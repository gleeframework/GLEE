"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, as that's my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 reflects the true value of this product, I understand your budget constraints. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still a bit too high.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,650,000 is still out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,500,000?  I'm eager to close this deal and believe this price is fair given the value of the product.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
