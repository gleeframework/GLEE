"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product, hoping to make Bob see it as more valuable than his initial $80 estimate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal profit margin. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $110 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for a little more to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm also setting a firm lower limit.
* **Focus on Win-Win:**  I'm emphasizing that I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $117? This is a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 117}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Push:** I'm making a final push for a price closer to my desired outcome. $117 is a small compromise for Bob, but it allows me to get closer to my minimum.
* **Urgency:**  I'm highlighting that I want to make a deal and get this done. 
* **Focus on Benefits:** I'm reminding Bob of the great value he'll get at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $117 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $112 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are in Round 6, and Bob's offer of $112 is only $3 above my minimum of $109.  However, with only 4 rounds left, I don't think I can push for a better price.  I'm not willing to risk a deal falling through. Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit and provides a much better outcome."
