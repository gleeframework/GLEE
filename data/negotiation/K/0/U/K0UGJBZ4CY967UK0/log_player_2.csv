"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's a negotiation tactic to begin with an offer significantly lower than your actual target price. This gives you room to negotiate upward.
* **Gauging Reaction:** Alice's response to this low offer will give you valuable information about her flexibility and how low she might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to balance that with the value the product holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down by $100,000, but she's still significantly above her known value for the product. We have room to negotiate further and get closer to a price that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. Let's try to find some middle ground.  How about $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  Instead of a large jump, we're increasing our offer by a smaller amount ($100,000) to show willingness to move but also to test her response to smaller concessions.
* **Staying Below John:** We're still well below John's offer, maintaining leverage in the negotiation.  We want to see how close we can get to Alice's value without getting too close to our maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're continuing to negotiate, Bob. I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is my minimum price. Can you go any higher? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reached her minimum price, which is also a great deal for us. There's no point in negotiating further or risking losing the deal by going to another round."
