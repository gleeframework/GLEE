"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can find a price that benefits us both. I'm starting with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is incredibly valuable, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,100,000?  This price is still below the product's true worth, and it allows you to secure it at a significant discount.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm ready to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit and allows me to acquire the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant discount, and it's a price that ensures we both benefit from this deal.  Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This price is a fair compromise, giving you a good profit while allowing me to acquire the product within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
