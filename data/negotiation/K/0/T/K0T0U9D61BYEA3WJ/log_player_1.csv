Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a better price from Bob.  I'm also considering that John is waiting in the wings with his offer of $8,000, so I don't want to risk losing out on a sale completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  It's only a little bit over my minimum value and I'm confident that I can get a better price from him if I keep negotiating.  I'm willing to risk a little to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It's still a decent profit for me, but shows that I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm hoping that this will be a sweet spot that Bob will be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,800 is getting closer to my desired price.  While it's still less than what I initially hoped for, it's a significant improvement over his previous offer and a good profit for me. I think it's time to accept and move on to the next sale!"
