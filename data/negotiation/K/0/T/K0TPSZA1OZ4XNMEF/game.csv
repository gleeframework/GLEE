"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to make this deal with you today. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $500000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $500000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between what I initially offered and your offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1250000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $750000. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price that's slightly above your offer. How about we meet at $850000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
