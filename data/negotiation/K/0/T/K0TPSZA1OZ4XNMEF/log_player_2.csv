Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $500000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between what I initially offered and your offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm closer to my limit, but I'd like to see if I can negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $750000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price that's slightly above your offer. How about we meet at $850000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's a bit higher than my last offer, but still significantly lower than what I would pay for John's product. This is a good deal for me."
