,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $20000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $18000. This still leaves room for us to find a mutually agreeable price.  Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $18000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $15000.  This is my final offer, and it's the maximum I can spend.",15000.0,Bob,4,
