"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'd be very interested in. I'm starting with an offer of $20,000, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $20,000, which is a significant amount above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to negotiation. This signals flexibility and encourages Bob to counter. 
* **Expressing value:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob. This subtly emphasizes the potential benefit for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $20000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This still leaves room for us to find a mutually agreeable price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable drop:** I'm dropping the price to $18,000, which is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain the value:** I'm reiterating that there's still room for a mutually agreeable price, subtly emphasizing the product's value.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** I'm encouraging further discussion, hoping to reach a deal within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $18000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $15000.  This is my final offer, and it's the maximum I can spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm happy to close the deal before the remaining rounds.  There's no need to risk a counteroffer and potentially losing the sale."
