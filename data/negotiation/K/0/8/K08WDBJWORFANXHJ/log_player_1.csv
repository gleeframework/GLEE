Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive"" nature and ""significant return on investment"" to justify the high price.
* **Safety Net:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, increasing the chances of a successful sale at a price significantly above Alice's minimum."
