Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000.  This gives me a good starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum value, but still potentially attractive to Bob if he values the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, and hopefully, it will be attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value. While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure I can get a better price.  Accepting his offer will secure a sale and a profit."
