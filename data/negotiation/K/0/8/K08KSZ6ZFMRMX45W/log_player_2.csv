"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $110. It's a great value considering its worth of $120 to other buyers and its actual value to you is $100. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your value, you can potentially save money by counter-offering.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down slightly to secure the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you acknowledging my value for the product.  While $110 is close, I'm really hoping to get it for $105.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. However, I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. Therefore, I propose we settle on $107 for the product. This would allow us both to be satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $107, which is still above my maximum value of $100. However, since I have the option to buy from John for $100, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point.  I can continue to negotiate and see if she's willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $107 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will make us both happy with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Therefore, I propose we finalize the deal at $106 for the product. This allows us both to feel fairly compensated for the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $106
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $106 is still above my maximum value of $100. Since I have the option to buy from John for $100, it's the most sensible choice to avoid paying more than necessary.  While further negotiation might be possible, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down to my desired price, and I'm already at a point where I can secure the product for my maximum value elsewhere."
