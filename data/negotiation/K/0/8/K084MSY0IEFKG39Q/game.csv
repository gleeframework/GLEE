"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your product has value, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $15000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $12000? I appreciate your understanding.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're working within a budget. However, $12000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Alice,3,
