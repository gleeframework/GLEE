"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a strong starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially begin a profitable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the value Bob places on the product. I want to see if I can secure a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. It signals flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum price and John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a good compromise.  It's closer to my ideal price, and accepting now ensures a sale without risking further negotiation rounds.  The chance of getting a higher offer is too risky given the limited rounds remaining."
