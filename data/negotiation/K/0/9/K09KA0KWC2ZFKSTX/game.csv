"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects the value this product holds for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $900,000 still isn't quite meeting my needs.  How about we split the difference at $925,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it reflects the value this product holds for you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
