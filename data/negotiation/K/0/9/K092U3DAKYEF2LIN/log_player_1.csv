Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I believe it offers significant advantages, and this price reflects its worth in the market.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's perceived value is lower, beginning with a strong offer above our minimum ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting ""unique value"" and ""worth in the market,"" we aim to shift Bob's focus towards the potential benefits rather than just his initial valuation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""initially proposing"" and ""what are your thoughts?"" signals our willingness to discuss the price and potentially find a compromise.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiating down to a price Bob might accept, which is still above our guaranteed sale to John."
