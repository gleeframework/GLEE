""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to your operations, especially given its potential for [mention a specific benefit related to Bob's needs/interests]. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000.  I think it's a fair price considering the potential return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, there's no reason to go lower.  You start at your ideal price.
* **Justification:** Simply stating a price might be met with resistance. Highlighting the product's value tailored to Bob's needs can increase his perceived value.
* **Confidence:** By expressing your belief in a fair price, you project confidence in your offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know John exists, Bob doesn't.  Your negotiation strategy relies on making the product seem highly valuable to Bob.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower price (e.g., $950,000) to leave him feeling good about the deal even if it's slightly below your ideal."
