"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm initially offering it for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I value your offer, $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money and $10,750 is still higher than his target price. He should try to negotiate further to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
