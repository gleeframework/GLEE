"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $1,100,000? This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,050,000. Would you consider $1,025,000? I feel that's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. This price point still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current positions. How about we try $1,052,500?",1052500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $1,038,000?  That's a fair compromise in my opinion.",1038000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,060,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet in the middle between our current positions? That would put the price at $1,049,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",1049000.0,Alice,7,
