"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $1200000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, you should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's no immediate benefit to accepting her offer, as you can get the product for the same price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $1000000 in my valuation. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise, as it is lower than her initial offer and closer to your counteroffer.  Accepting this offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
