"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  $950,000 is a significant profit for me, but it's also a good starting point to see how interested Bob is in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, I can still do better. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway.  $900,000 is a good compromise, and still leaves me with a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  $875,000 is closer to my goal, but I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get even closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000} 
```

I'm going to try one more time to see if I can get Bob closer to my target price.  $890,000 is a good compromise, and still leaves me with a healthy profit."
