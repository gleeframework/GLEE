"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for me. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's a good compromise and allows us to both get a fair deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product holds for me. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
