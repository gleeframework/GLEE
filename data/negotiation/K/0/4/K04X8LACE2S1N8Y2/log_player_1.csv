Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm eager to make a deal, $1,100,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. $1,050,000 is too far below my minimum value for this product. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm not willing to go below $1,200,000.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?

You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to make another counteroffer, but if he doesn't budge, I might start considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to get a little frustrated here.  We've been going back and forth, and I'm still not seeing a price that works for me.  If you're serious about this deal, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'm going to have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're frustrated, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm at my maximum budget of $950,000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below what I'm willing to accept. We've gone through several rounds, and it's clear that we're not going to agree on a price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  It's a better deal for me, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
