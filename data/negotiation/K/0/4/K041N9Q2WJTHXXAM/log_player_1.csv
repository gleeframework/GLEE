Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's how Alice should approach this offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Reservation Price:**  The minimum Alice will accept is $1,500,000 (her value from selling to John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between what Alice needs to earn and what Bob is willing to pay. 

**The Challenge:** Alice can't sell the product to Bob for more than his valuation ($1,200,000). If she prices it higher, he'll reject the offer.

**Optimal Strategy:**

Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her reservation price, she should aim slightly higher than Bob's valuation, hoping he might be willing to pay a bit more. However, there's a risk Bob will reject the offer.

**The Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it offers.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Targeting Slightly Above Bob's Valuation:**  The $1,250,000 price is a gamble, hoping Bob might be willing to stretch his budget slightly. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" subtly suggesting it might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.
* **Clear Call to Action:**  Alice directly asks for Bob's decision.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject this offer. If he does, Alice should immediately sell to John at her guaranteed price of $1,500,000."
