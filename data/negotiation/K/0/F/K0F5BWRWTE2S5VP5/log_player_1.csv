"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,200,000 is way out of my price range.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000. That's the maximum I can afford, and it's still a significant investment for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product.  To keep this negotiation moving, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. While I still believe $1,900,000 is too high, I'm willing to increase my offer slightly.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable amount, it's still significantly less than what John is offering. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can bridge the gap, but I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a strong alternative."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I'm seeing your commitment here. To meet you closer to your offer, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. This is a fair price that respects both our positions.  I truly hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting much closer to a reasonable price, but I'm still leaving a significant amount of money on the table compared to John's offer. I'll continue to negotiate, but I need to see Bob moving closer to the $1,500,000 mark."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as it's the lowest I'm willing to go to secure a deal today."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm committed to making this deal work. However, $1,450,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price at this point.  It's time to cut my losses and move forward with the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
