"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,200,000.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,200,000 is way out of my price range.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000. That's the maximum I can afford, and it's still a significant investment for me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product.  To keep this negotiation moving, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. While I still believe $1,900,000 is too high, I'm willing to increase my offer slightly.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I'm seeing your commitment here. To meet you closer to your offer, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. This is a fair price that respects both our positions.  I truly hope we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as it's the lowest I'm willing to go to secure a deal today.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm committed to making this deal work. However, $1,450,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
