{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm confident in the value of the product.  I'll need to watch Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell for less than my minimum.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is just too low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500? This still leaves you a good margin for profit, and it's fair for me as well."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum price, and I'm happy to accept it.  It's better than selling to John, and it avoids further negotiation."
