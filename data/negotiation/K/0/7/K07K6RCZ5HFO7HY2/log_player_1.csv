"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is far too low, and accepting it would mean a significant loss.  While selling to John is tempting, there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below the value this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This feels like a fair price considering its benefits."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $19,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could consider going up to $9,500.  Do you think we could make something work around there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is inching closer, but his current offer is still significantly below my minimum. I'll hold firm for now, but selling to John is becoming more appealing as the rounds progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. How about $17,000? This reflects my bottom line while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 17000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down, but that's still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,000, but that's really the most I can do.  It's a fair offer considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob seems to be stuck at $10,000, which is significantly less than what John is offering. While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely Bob will drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
