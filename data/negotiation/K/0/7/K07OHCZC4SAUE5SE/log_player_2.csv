# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you and the potential profit you can make. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above your target of $800,000.  It's worth attempting to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still slightly below my expectations.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above your target, it's close enough to be worth considering.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing her to reject future offers and potentially leading you to buy from John.  Accepting Alice's offer provides a decent profit margin and avoids further negotiation."
