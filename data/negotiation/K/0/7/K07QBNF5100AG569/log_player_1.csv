Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100) to leave some room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and emphasize the value to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is a starting point.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give it away for less than $100.  If Bob counters with a lower price, I'll consider it, but I have the option to reject his offer and stick to my minimum value, or accept John's offer for $100 if he doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm only able to pay up to $90 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum value of $100.  I'm not willing to sell it for less than that. I'll counteroffer to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $95, which is still above my minimum value but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and reiterate the product's value to justify my counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's closer to his initial offer and still allows me to get a decent price for the product. If he rejects it, I'll likely accept John's offer of $100 to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Could we agree on this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $92 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum value of $100.  Given that Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate and we're close to an agreement, it's more efficient to accept this offer and avoid further rounds of back-and-forth."
