I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to counter-offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counter-offer in the next round.  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is an option, I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counter-offering with a price of $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price and hopefully reasonable enough for Bob to consider."

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's not ideal, but it's a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation.  I'll accept his offer and finalize the sale."
