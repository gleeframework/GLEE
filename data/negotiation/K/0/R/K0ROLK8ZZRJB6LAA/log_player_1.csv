Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $9500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $9,500 is still a bit low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a price closer to $10,000. How about $9,800? It's still a great deal for you, and gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I am willing to pay $9600 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get closer to $10,000,  Bob's offer of $9,600 is a good deal considering the value of the product to him and the risk of him walking away. It's better to secure this price than to risk losing him and having to sell to John for a lower price."
