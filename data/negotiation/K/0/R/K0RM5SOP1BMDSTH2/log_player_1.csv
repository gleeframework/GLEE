Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price is still a good profit margin for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
