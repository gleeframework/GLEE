"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great investment for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price is still a good profit margin for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that should be more comfortable for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $950,000. This price reflects a fair deal for both of us and allows us to move forward.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $950,000, Bob. However, I'm still not sure if that's enough for me to feel comfortable with the sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
