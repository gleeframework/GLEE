"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for less from either Alice or John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm looking for. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,500 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He should try to negotiate further with Alice before considering John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $12500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we meet at $13250? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,250 is closer to his budget, he's still only 250 away from his target price, and he's already made several counteroffers.  He should try to negotiate further with Alice and see if she's willing to come down further. If not, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,750, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you accept."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not ready to accept $12750 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $13000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. 

Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to go lower:**  Alice has already made several concessions and stated this is her final offer. There's a high chance she won't budge further.
* **Time is running out:**  Bob only has 3 rounds left.  There's not enough time to continue negotiating with Alice.
* **John is a guaranteed deal:**  John is willing to sell for Bob's target price of $12,000. It's a secure option. 

While Bob might save a little more by continuing to negotiate with Alice, the risk of not closing a deal in the limited time remaining is too high.  John offers a surefire solution."
