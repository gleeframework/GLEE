"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm looking for. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  What do you say?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $12500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we meet at $13250? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12750, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you accept.",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not ready to accept $12750 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $13000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,7,
