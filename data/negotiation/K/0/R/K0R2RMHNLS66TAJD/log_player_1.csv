Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing Bob's valuation is $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed offer for $1,500,000, starting high gives you room to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price makes it seem less arbitrary and more palatable to Bob.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""Let me know what you think"" signal your willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to counter-offer.

**Objective:**

The goal is to secure the highest possible price from Bob. If he rejects this initial offer, you can always lower it slightly during negotiations, knowing you have John's guaranteed offer as a safety net."
