"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. I would like to counteroffer at $9,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $9,750? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",9750.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I'm not comfortable going above $9,500, I'd like to meet you halfway. Would $9,625 work for you?",9625.0,Bob,4,
