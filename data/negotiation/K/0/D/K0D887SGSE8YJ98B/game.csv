"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you.  It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it could significantly benefit your operations.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, while still leaving room for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
