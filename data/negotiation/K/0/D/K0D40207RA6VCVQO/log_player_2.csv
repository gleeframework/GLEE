"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is way above your budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product, though. Would you be willing to consider $8,000? "", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with my maximum budget and making a bold counteroffer. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but also establishes a clear starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  $11,000 is still above my budget.  Alice has shown some flexibility, but I'm not willing to go that high yet. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from $8,000 to $9,500, showing a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer still leaves some room for negotiation and keeps the price below my maximum budget of $8,000 if I decide to go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $10800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $10,800 is still above my comfort zone. I'm only $800 away from my maximum budget with John, so I'm going to try to get Alice down a little more before considering that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  $10,800 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming to stay below $10,000.  Would you be open to $9,800?  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm making a final counteroffer to Alice, increasing my price to $9,800. This keeps me within my target range but is still slightly below the $10,000 mark. It's a good compromise, and I'm hoping Alice will agree to it. If she doesn't, I'll be ready to move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $10500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is still offering a price above my maximum budget of $8,000.  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and I'm getting close to my limit.  At this point, it makes more sense to buy the product from John for $8,000.  I've saved $700 compared to Alice's offer, and I'm confident that I can find a similar product elsewhere if needed in the future."
