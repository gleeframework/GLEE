"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10000. Would you be willing to consider that price? I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. If that works for you, I'm ready to move forward. ",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $14500. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $14500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $12000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to move on to another seller.",12000.0,Bob,6,
