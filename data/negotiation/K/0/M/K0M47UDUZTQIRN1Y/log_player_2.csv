You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. $9,000 is more than your maximum budget, and you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within your budget. It gives Alice some room to negotiate while also saving you money."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. While you can technically afford it, it's always better to try and get the best deal possible.  You can likely negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer is your final offer and matches John's price. If Alice rejects it, you can confidently go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer is only slightly better than John's price. It's not worth risking further negotiation, especially since there's a chance Alice might counteroffer again with an even higher price. You're guaranteed the product for $8,000 from John, so it's best to just go with that option."
