Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I've been negotiating for a few rounds and we're getting close to a deal.  I'm also concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, he may get frustrated and walk away. It's better to get $125 now than risk getting nothing later."
