"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price significantly higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a great outcome. 
* **Justification:**  Even though the price is high,  the message emphasizes the product's value and invites Bob to share his perspective. This opens the door for him to potentially justify a higher price than his initial valuation. 
* **Alternative:** Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to  $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below what you're willing to accept.  You have plenty of room to negotiate and John as a reliable backup offer.  It's time to start working your way down strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect that.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This takes into account your feedback while acknowledging the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're coming down from your initial offer, but not drastically. This signals willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Justification:** You're reiterating the product's value to justify a higher price, even with the reduction. 
* **Time Consideration:**  You have plenty of rounds left, so there's no need to rush into a deal far below your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said, $1,900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, But Not Enough:** Bob is moving closer to your range, but $1,250,000 is still significantly under your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Leverage:**  You have John's offer as a strong fallback, so you're in a good position to hold firm.
* **Continued Negotiation:** There are several rounds left. Rejecting this offer shows Bob you're serious about getting closer to your target price while giving you the opportunity to counter with a figure closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant investment for you, but I truly believe the product's value will prove itself in the long run."", ""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Movement:**  You're dropping your price by $200,000, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to make a deal.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  You're still comfortably above your $1,500,000 minimum and John's offer,  leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Reiterating the product's long-term value reinforces your pricing and subtly nudges Bob to think beyond his immediate budget concerns."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can feel it!  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,475,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,475,000 is just barely under your $1,500,000 guarantee from John, but it's close enough to be acceptable.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob might walk away or you won't reach a significantly better agreement. Accepting now secures a solid profit.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means you receive the payment sooner, which has its own inherent value."
