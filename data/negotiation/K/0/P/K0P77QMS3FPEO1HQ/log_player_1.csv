I've reached the 8th round, and while Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not there.  There's only a small difference between what Bob is offering and my minimum price, but it's important for me to reach my goal.  Considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John, it's best to sell to him and ensure I get my minimum price."
