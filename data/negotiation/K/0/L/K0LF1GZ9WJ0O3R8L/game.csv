"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me and the potential return, I'd like to propose a price of $950000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a suitable middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to work with you, $950000 is still a bit below my minimum price point.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price allows for a healthy profit for both of us, while still reflecting the significant value of the product.  I'm confident that this offer represents a win-win situation. Let's continue this conversation and see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1050000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to my initial counteroffer. I'd like to offer $1000000. This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us, allowing for a healthy profit while ensuring a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's see if we can finalize this deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
