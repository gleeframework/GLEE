Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to work with you, $950000 is still a bit below my minimum price point.

This price allows for a healthy profit for both of us, while still reflecting the significant value of the product.  I'm confident that this offer represents a win-win situation.
