"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a strong starting point, as it's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still within a reasonable range. It also gives me some room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm offering $16,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a decent price that gives me a profit. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,500 is getting closer to my desired price.  I'm going to accept it and sell the product to him.  While I could try to get a higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether increases with each round.  $14,500 is a solid price that gives me a profit and allows me to move on."
