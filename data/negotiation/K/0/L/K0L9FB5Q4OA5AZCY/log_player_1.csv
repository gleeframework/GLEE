Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is simply out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is the maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing too slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's significantly better than John's offer of $1,000,000.  Therefore, it's more profitable to cut negotiations with Bob short and sell to John."
