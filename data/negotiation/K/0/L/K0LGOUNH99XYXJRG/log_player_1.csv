Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see significant value in. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your operations."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting high aims to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a range favorable to Alice. 
* **Consider Bob's Valuation:** The price is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) making it more appealing.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John provides a guaranteed $800,000 allows Alice to be bolder in her initial offer to Bob."
