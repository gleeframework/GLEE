"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe this product holds significant value, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a purchase at $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we settle at $1,175,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
