Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it would be highly valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible without losing the sale. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still ensuring Alice earns more than John's offer. 
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the price."
