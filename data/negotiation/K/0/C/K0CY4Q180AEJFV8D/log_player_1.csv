Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Ambitious but not Unreasonable:** While the product is worth $10,000 to both of you, there's a chance Bob might value specific aspects or the convenience of getting it immediately, justifying a higher price to him.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. His response will provide valuable information for your next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a solid profit, it's still significantly below your initial ask. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to negotiate, and there's potential to meet somewhere in the middle. You'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,500?"", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  By decreasing the price by $1,500, you demonstrate movement towards a deal, which can encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  $13,500 ensures a healthy profit margin, keeping your primary goal in focus."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,800. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $12,800 is a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing the sale to John increases.  Bob is unlikely to drastically increase his offer.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
