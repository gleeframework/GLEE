Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still making a profit and have room to negotiate lower if needed.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer. 

We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $120. Selling to John guarantees a profit of $120, which is far more desirable.  It's important to stick to our minimum profit threshold unless we are extremely confident we can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $95? That's still a good price for a great product, and it's closer to your budget."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  We acknowledge Bob's budget but also express that $80 is unacceptable. 
* **Mid-point:**  $95 is a middle ground between our previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $80.
* **Positive Framing:**  We highlight the value of the product and reiterate a ""good deal"" to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. Could we possibly settle at $90? It's still a bit above my ideal price, but I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to our minimum acceptable price, it's still below our ideal profit margin.  Since John is a guaranteed sale for $120, we should stick to our original strategy and see if we can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $90 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  Would you consider $92?  It's a small step up, but it would make this deal work for me."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and express appreciation for his willingness to negotiate.
* **Small Increment:**  The counter-offer of $92 is a small increase from Bob's offer of $90, demonstrating a desire to compromise.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** We emphasize that the price is ""a small step up"" but will ""make this deal work"" for both of us."
