"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,500 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,000 is still significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. To be fair, I'll come down a bit to $9,500.  This is my final offer.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $9,500 is closer, it's still just outside my budget.  Would you consider $7,500?  I think that's a fair price.",7500.0,Bob,6,
