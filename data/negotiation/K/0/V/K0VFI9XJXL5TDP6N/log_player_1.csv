Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth while acknowledging your discerning eye for quality."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), I want to maximize my potential profit. Starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""immense value"" to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's potential desire for a unique product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While this high price might make Bob reject the offer outright, the potential reward of securing an extra $500,000 outweighs the risk of going straight to my backup buyer."
