"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, we're confident it's worth more than what others might pay for it. Considering its true worth and your potential satisfaction, we propose a price of $120 for this exceptional item. We believe this offer strikes a balance between fair compensation for us and an affordable price for you, maximizing the value for both parties. We look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is persuasive, $120 is still above your maximum budget. You know you can get the product for $150 from John, but rejecting Alice's offer might lead to a better counter-offer or allow you to negotiate a lower price."
