"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the full value of the product to me. This is a high starting point but gives me room to negotiate and leaves open the option of selling to John if Bob isn't willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a significant drop from my original price but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd still prefer $10,000, I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation or potentially selling to John for less."
