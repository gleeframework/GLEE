"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, so how about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $975,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll be moving on to other buyers.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
