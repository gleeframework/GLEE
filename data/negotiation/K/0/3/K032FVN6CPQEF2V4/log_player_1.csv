Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm valuing it at $1,200,000. I know this is a premium price, but I believe its long-term benefits for you are significant. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Alice starts with a significantly higher price ($1,200,000) than her minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows her to capture some of the value Bob sees in the product. 
* **Justification:**  Alice doesn't just throw out a number. She uses phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" to frame the product as highly desirable. She also mentions ""long-term benefits"" to appeal to Bob's potential return on investment.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains  open for discussion.  By saying ""Let me know your thoughts,"" Alice invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation process.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's risk tolerance:**  It's unclear how price-sensitive Bob is. If he's very price-sensitive, a lower initial offer might be wiser. 
* **Relationship dynamics:** If Alice wants to build a long-term relationship with Bob, a less aggressive starting price might be more appropriate. 
* **Information asymmetry:** Alice has the advantage of knowing John's guaranteed purchase price.  However, Bob doesn't have this information. 

This offer aims to maximize Alice's profit while acknowledging the need for a strategic negotiation with Bob."
