# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value and your interest, I propose we keep this opportunity confidential between us. For a limited time, you can acquire this exceptional item for $140. This is a special offer tailored to appreciate your interest and ensure you receive a great deal without compromising on quality. Don't miss out on this opportunity to own something truly remarkable at an attractive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $150 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further.  You're not losing anything by rejecting at this point."
