This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob decides to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'd like to save some money on this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, I believe there's still room for a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'd like to make a more substantial reduction. How about $1,060,000?

While I'd like to get a higher price, Bob's latest offer is getting closer to John's offer. At this point, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to secure the deal and avoid the possibility of losing out entirely."
