"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $13,500.  This is a fair compromise that's closer to both of our goals. What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,000 and $13,500, which is $14,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,250 is still above my budget. I'm really hoping to secure this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. My final offer is $13,000.  This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair value for this product.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,6,
