"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and your potential loss. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to make a deal. Considering your offer of $9500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9500. I believe this is a fair price, and it allows us both to make a decent deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $9500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $10200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
