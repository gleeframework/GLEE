Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be a great fit for you. Given its value, I'm offering it for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I think it's a great product, but I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth the full $11,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $9,800 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a little, how about we meet in the middle at $10,750?"", ""product_price"": 10750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I've done some more research and I'm confident that's a fair price for this product. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to offers significantly below his known valuation of the product. While there's a chance he *might* go higher, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. Accepting his current offer is a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer."
