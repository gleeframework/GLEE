Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $912,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $918,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while giving you a good deal. Let's finalize this today.

We've negotiated Alice down significantly. While we might be able to get the price lower, it's getting riskier. Accepting at $918,750 guarantees a good deal without the risk of Alice walking away or running out of negotiation rounds."
