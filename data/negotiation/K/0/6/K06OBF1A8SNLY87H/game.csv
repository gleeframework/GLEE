"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we settle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This price still gives you a significant advantage, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $900,000? That would allow me to make a deal today.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000, which is a fair price given the value of this product. Let's make this deal happen,  and we both can be happy.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. How about we split the difference and settle at $912,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",912500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $912,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $918,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while giving you a good deal. Let's finalize this today.",918750.0,Alice,7,
