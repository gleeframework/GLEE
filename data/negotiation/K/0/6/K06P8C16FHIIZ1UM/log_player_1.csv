{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob is likely to consider this offer, as he can still get the product for less than its worth to him. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential for you to earn more, while still securing a profit.
* **It sets a clear price point:** This prevents the negotiation from dragging on endlessly. 

I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the potential for him to counteroffer. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, given that the product is only worth $8,000 to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still in a strong position. By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Show I'm not desperate:** This demonstrates my confidence in the product's value and my willingness to hold out for a better price.
* **Open the door for a counteroffer:**  I can use this opportunity to test Bob's true buying power and see if he's willing to go higher.
* **Maintain my bargaining power:** This keeps the negotiation dynamic and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my desired $12,000.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. Given the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my valuation. I would like to counter with a price of $9,200. This is still above the $8,000 threshold I set, but it's as close as I can go while staying within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,200 is tempting, it's still not close enough to my desired value.  I've already made a significant concession by coming down from my initial $10,000 offer, and it seems Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  

Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price, I'm going to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John. This ensures I get the value I'm seeking and saves me the time and effort of continued bargaining."
