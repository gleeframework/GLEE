"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a better deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we meet at $11,500? That's the best I can do right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John.  It's important to consider the potential for further negotiation breaking down and losing out on any sale altogether."
