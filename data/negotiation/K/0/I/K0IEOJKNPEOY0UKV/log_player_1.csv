"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $130. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit steep for me. How about $110?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Even though Bob's offer is significantly above my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better price closer to his perceived value of $150.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $120 is closer, but I'm still a little over budget. How about $115?  I'm hoping we can find a good compromise here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $115 is a solid profit above my minimum. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation failing."
