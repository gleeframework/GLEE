Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** $100 is a significant markup from your minimum but still within a potentially acceptable range for Bob if the product is valuable to him.
* **First Offer Advantage:** By positioning the offer as time-sensitive (""offering it to you first""), you create a subtle sense of urgency. 

This strategy aims to test Bob's willingness to pay while leaving room for negotiation if he counters. If he rejects, you haven't lost anything, as John will buy it at your baseline."
