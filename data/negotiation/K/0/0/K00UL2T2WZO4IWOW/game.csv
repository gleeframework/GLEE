"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for coming down to $1,300,000, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,250,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
