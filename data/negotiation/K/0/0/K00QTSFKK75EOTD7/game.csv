"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm seeing some movement here, which is good.  To make this work, I could come down to $16,000.  This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is still a little too steep for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,500.  Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Bob,6,
