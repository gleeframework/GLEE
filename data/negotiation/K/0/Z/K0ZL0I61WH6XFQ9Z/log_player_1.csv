"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold opening, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$500,000 is far too low for me. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop that much in a single round. I'll counteroffer and see if I can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $900,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a significant profit margin. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and bring us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$600,000 is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving up that much value just yet.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm coming down to $850,000.  This is a significant concession, but I'm still holding out for a good deal.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope Bob will agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a bit more. I'll counteroffer again, but if we don't reach an agreement soon, I might consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm offering $750,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target. I'm running out of rounds, so I need to decide soon whether I'm going to settle with Bob or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. We're down to the wire, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not enough for me to feel comfortable. John's offer guarantees me my minimum, and it's time to end this negotiation."
