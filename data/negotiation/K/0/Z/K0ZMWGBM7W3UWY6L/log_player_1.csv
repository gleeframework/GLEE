Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $14,000. I believe it will be incredibly valuable for you."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start above your minimum price in a negotiation. This leaves room for concessions and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to haggle the price down. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves space to negotiate down towards his perceived value of $10,000, while still staying above your own minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is and how far he might be willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is closer to his perceived value than yours. While it's above your minimum, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and are willing to walk away if necessary. This keeps the door open for a counteroffer that's more favorable to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Appear Flexible):** By suggesting a price of $12,500, you're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Hold Firm (Above Minimum):** This counteroffer is still comfortably above your $12,000 minimum and closer to your initial asking price.
* **Signal Your Bottom Line:**  This counteroffer subtly signals that you're getting closer to your lowest acceptable price, encouraging Bob to make a serious offer if he truly wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is less than your ideal price, it's still a profit above your $12,000 minimum.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away, and you already have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John. It's often better to take a good deal now than risk losing it for a slightly better one that might not materialize."
