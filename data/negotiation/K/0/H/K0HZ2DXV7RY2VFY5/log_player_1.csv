Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting high, aiming for the maximum value of the product to me. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I'm confident John will be a reliable backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$700,000 is too low for me. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $900,000. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to my desired value, I'm not willing to settle for less than $800,000. I'm confident I can get a better price with another counteroffer, or even sell to John for $1,000,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering a price of $850,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value of the product to both of us."
