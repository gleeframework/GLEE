The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $95. While that's a good deal, I can likely get it for cheaper. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Alice $90. It's a fair price, considering the product is worth $80 to her and $100 to me. I hope she accepts it, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."

Alice is getting closer to my price point, but I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again."

I'm going to offer $91. It's a small compromise from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering Alice has lowered her offer as well.  I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal."

Alice is now offering the product for $91.5, which is very close to my target price. It's still a good deal for me considering the product is worth $100 to me. I'll accept this offer and close the deal."
