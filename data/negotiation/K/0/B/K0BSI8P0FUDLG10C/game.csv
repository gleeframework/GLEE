,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7,800, but that's as high as I can go.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,800 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,200,  which is a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,800 and $8,200. How about we settle on $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,6,
