"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to consider $12000?  I'm genuinely interested in this product, but I need to stay within a specific budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $13500 is still a bit high, but I'm getting closer to my budget.  Would you consider $13000?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
