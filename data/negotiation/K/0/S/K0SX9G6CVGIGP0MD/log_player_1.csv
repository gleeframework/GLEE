"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. Although it's tempting to close the deal at $85, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I think I can get a better deal by continuing negotiations with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $85 just isn't quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $90?  That's still a great deal for you, as you'd be getting it for $10 less than it's worth to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $87.50 for the product. Can you meet me halfway and accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  $87.50 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet at $89? That's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $88? That's the highest I'm willing to go.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, $88 is a good deal and it's getting late in the game. It's important to make a reasonable compromise and close the deal."
