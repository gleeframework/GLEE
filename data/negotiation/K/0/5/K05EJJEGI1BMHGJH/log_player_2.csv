"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is above Bob's limit. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $1,500,000, and Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000. 

**Next Steps:** Bob will counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** Although it's lower than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation continues:** Bob can still try to negotiate a better price, as Alice is willing to compromise and both parties have some wiggle room.

**Next Steps:** Bob will counteroffer again in the next round, aiming to get closer to his desired price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I understand the product's value to you, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000. This price is fair given its value to me, and it allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $1,250,000, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1,280,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $1,280,000 is below Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Alice and forcing Bob to buy from John at the higher price of $1,200,000.

**Next Steps:** Bob should accept the offer to secure the product at a reasonable price."
