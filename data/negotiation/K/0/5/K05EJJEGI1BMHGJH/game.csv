"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I understand the product's value to you, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000. This price is fair given its value to me, and it allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $1,250,000, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1,280,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
