Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm asking for $950,000, a price that reflects its true worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so I need to offer a price that's attractive but leaves room for profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will pay $1,000,000 gives me leverage. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The $950,000 offer leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob while still aiming high.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a profitable price and not losing the opportunity to sell to John at my desired value."
