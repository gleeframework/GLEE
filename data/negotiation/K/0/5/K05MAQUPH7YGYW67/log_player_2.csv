"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. I believe this price represents a fair value for both of us. You'll be getting a valuable product at a price significantly lower than you would find elsewhere. However, if you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my full asking price. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
