Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm going to see if I can negotiate him up a bit more."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's still a great price for a product worth $10,000 to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,750 is tempting, I still believe I can push for a higher price. I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too far below what the product is worth to me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,750 is still a bit too low. Let's meet halfway again.  I'm willing to come down to $8,875. It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 8875}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has been insistent on $8,750, and while it's a better deal than selling to John, it's still not a price I'm entirely comfortable with.  I've given him a fair amount of leeway and I'm starting to run out of time. I'm going to sell to John to secure a guaranteed profit."
