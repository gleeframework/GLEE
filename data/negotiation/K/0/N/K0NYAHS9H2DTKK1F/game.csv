"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, $18,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000?  I believe this reflects the product's true worth.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $20,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $17,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $17,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $19,000. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a valuable asset.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable going above $18,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $19,000 and $17,500. How about we try $18,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",18250.0,Bob,6,
