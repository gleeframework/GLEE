"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $115. I think it's a great deal for you, given its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $105. Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that's still slightly above Alice's value of the product ($100), showing he's willing to negotiate. This leaves room for Alice to make a concession, while also demonstrating that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $110 is a reasonable compromise. It's closer to Bob's desired price of $105 and still above Alice's value of $100. Accepting this offer means Bob gets the product for a price within his budget and saves $10 compared to buying from John.  While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, the risk of losing the deal or having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for further savings."
