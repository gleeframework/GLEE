"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,050,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
