"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for my comfort. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair price that still allows you to get a great deal, while also ensuring I get a good return on my investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still looking to come in a bit lower. How about $825,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me while also being a good deal for you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. How about we settle at $840,000? I think this is a fair price that balances out the value of the product and our negotiation so far.",840000.0,Alice,5,
