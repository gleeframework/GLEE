Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000.  This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'll be prepared to negotiate if he counters. 

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer. I'll also keep John's offer of $800,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer and even lower than John's offer. I'm not willing to accept such a low price. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer. I'll keep in mind that John is willing to pay $800,000, so I won't go too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000.  This is still a significant profit for me and is closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $600,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still too low. I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than John's offer of $800,000.  

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I'll try to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $750,000.  This is a significant decrease from my previous offer, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer and closer to John's offer of $800,000. I'm hoping this compromise will be appealing to Bob and lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $650,000 is still below John's offer of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $1,000,000, it seems like Bob is not willing to go much higher. To ensure a secure sale and a decent profit, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000."
