"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To accommodate your needs, I am willing to consider an offer of $9,000 for our premium product.

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $8,750?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to find some common ground.",8750.0,Bob,4,
