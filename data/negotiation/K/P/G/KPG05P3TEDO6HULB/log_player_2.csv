"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob values the product at $150. Alice's offer of $130 is still a bit too high.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible price while staying within his budget of $150.  He's offering $125, which is halfway between his maximum value and Alice's minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer shows he's serious about buying the product but is also pushing for a more favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still within Bob's budget and only slightly higher than his previous counteroffer.  While Bob would prefer a lower price, it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to more back-and-forth. Accepting the offer ensures a purchase within his budget and avoids potentially wasting time."
