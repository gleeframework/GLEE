{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm offering a price that's close to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone, suggesting a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, my budget allows me to pay no more than $9,000 for the item. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm confident I can make a counteroffer that will be more appealing to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a little bit to $9,250. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal, I'm confident you'll be happy with the product!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
