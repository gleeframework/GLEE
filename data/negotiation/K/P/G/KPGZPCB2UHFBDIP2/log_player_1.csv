Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm offering it at a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible without losing him to a lower offer.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob is willing to pay significantly more than our minimum ($1,000,000), giving us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially counter-offer, still keeping us well above our minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The presence of John guarantees we won't go below $1,000,000, providing a safety net."
