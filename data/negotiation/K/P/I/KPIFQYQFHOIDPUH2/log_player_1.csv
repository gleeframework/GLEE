Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value this product holds, $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $950000. This is a fair price considering your value for it is $800000, and it still leaves a significant profit for you. Let me know what you think.
