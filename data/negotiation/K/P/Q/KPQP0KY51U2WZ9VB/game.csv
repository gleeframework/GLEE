"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,5,
