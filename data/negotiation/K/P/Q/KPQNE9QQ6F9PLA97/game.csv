"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $17,000?  That's a substantial reduction on my initial offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
