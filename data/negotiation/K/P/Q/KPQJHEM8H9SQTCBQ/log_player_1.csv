Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than your $80 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can still go lower if Bob rejects and you want to avoid selling to John.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  He's still getting a good deal at $120 compared to his $150 valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below the desired profit margin. Rejecting allows for further negotiation to potentially get closer to the initial $120 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $100 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference at $110? That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $105? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $105 is still less than the initial $120 offer, it's a better deal than selling to John for $80.  Bob has indicated that this is his final offer, so further negotiation may lead to a stalemate and force you to sell to John. Accepting the offer ensures a sale at a reasonable price."
