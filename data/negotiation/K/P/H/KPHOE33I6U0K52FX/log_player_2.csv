Alice's offer:

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:**  Alice started extremely high and is coming down in increments that don't suggest she'll meet your $1,000,000 limit. 
* **You have a guaranteed option:** John offers a sure thing at your maximum price.  
* **Negotiation fatigue:** Continuing with Alice might waste valuable time and energy, especially if she's not truly willing to negotiate within your budget."
