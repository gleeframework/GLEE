,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $6,000 is too low for me. How about $8,500? It's still a good deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000, which is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
