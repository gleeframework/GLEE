,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This would still give you a great deal on a high-quality product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,750 is still a bit below my minimum.  Let's try $12,000. This price is fair to both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
