"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive,  I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we split the difference again and settle at $850,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
