{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $14,000 is less than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** The message is friendly and encouraging Bob to respond.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and save some money. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $11,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **There's still room for negotiation:**  Bob is showing interest and is willing to negotiate. 

It's important to stick to my minimum to maximize my profit.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low. $11,500 is below my minimum price.  How about we split the difference and meet at $12,750? It's still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $15,000. Let's work together to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is higher than my minimum:**  $12,750 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Counter-offer is lower than Bob's offer:** $12,750 is less than what Bob is willing to pay. This shows flexibility and encourages him to agree. 
* **Message is still positive:** The message continues to be friendly and encouraging, highlighting the potential win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12000? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  $12,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.
* **Selling to John would yield the same amount:**  Selling to John would also result in $12,000.

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm comfortable accepting Bob's offer as it meets my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
