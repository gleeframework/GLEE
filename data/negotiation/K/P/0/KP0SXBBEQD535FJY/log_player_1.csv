Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting with a significantly higher offer than your minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum price. This knowledge allows you to be bolder with Bob.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:**  Framing the offer as ""exclusive"" adds perceived value and might make Bob more inclined to accept a higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counter-offers.  Listen to his perspective and be ready to adjust your price to find a mutually agreeable point."
