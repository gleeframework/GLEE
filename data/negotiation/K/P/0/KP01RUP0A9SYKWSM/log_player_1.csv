"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 9500} 

This is a strong starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation, ensuring you don't give away too much in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer and closer to your desired price.  It shows you're willing to negotiate, but also demonstrates the value of the product to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below your minimum acceptable price, and you've already had a couple of rounds of negotiation. It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed offer from John."
