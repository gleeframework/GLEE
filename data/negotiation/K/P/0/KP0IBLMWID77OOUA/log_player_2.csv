"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first.  $900,000 is over your budget, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best initial move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, about 20% lower than Alice's initial price. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal but also leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still above my budget, but she's getting closer. Rejecting and counteroffering again seems like the best move for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise but still trying to get a lower price. This keeps the pressure on her while maintaining a reasonable negotiation pace."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, but it's getting close.  I'm going to reject her offer and counteroffer again, seeing if I can get her down to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm making my final push here.  This is my maximum budget, and it's time to see if Alice will meet me halfway."
