Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product today. I think it's worth a significant amount to you given its capabilities, so I'm suggesting a price of $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:**  While simply stating a price is an option, providing a reason (even if vague) can make the offer seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering it at $16,000, you signal a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you knew Bob was very price-sensitive or disliked haggling, you might start with a lower offer.
* **Market Information:** This assumes you have limited information about Bob's price sensitivity. If you knew more about the market or Bob's willingness to pay, you could adjust accordingly."
