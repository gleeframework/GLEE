"I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,400,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still leaves room for profit on both sides. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,450,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  To show you I'm willing to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits us both.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
