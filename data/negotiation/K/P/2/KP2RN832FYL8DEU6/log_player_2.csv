"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business.  It's worth at least $1.5 million to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's significantly less.  I'm confident this is an opportunity you won't want to miss.  Let's discuss a price that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to frame the product as being worth much more than it is to her. While her offer is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you might be able to get her to come down closer to her own valuation."
