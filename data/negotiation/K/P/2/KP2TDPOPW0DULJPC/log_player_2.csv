Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, reflecting the potential benefits and current market conditions. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of the market conditions. To better align with your offer while still valuing the product appropriately, I propose a counteroffer of $1300000. This reflects a compromise between our respective positions and aims to ensure mutual satisfaction in the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high.  Although it's closer to my desired price, there's still room for further negotiation. I want to see if I can push for a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Given the market conditions and my budget constraints, I'm only able to offer $1,250,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued engagement, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer of $1275000. This price takes into account the value you see in the product and adjusts slightly to meet your financial considerations. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for, and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is within my acceptable range.  While I'd ideally like to pay less, it's getting closer to my target price and I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate. It's also a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer and finalize the transaction."
