"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to offer $1200000, reflecting the potential benefits and current market conditions. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of the market conditions. To better align with your offer while still valuing the product appropriately, I propose a counteroffer of $1300000. This reflects a compromise between our respective positions and aims to ensure mutual satisfaction in the transaction.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1300000 is still a bit too high for me.  Given the market conditions and my budget constraints, I'm only able to offer $1250000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
