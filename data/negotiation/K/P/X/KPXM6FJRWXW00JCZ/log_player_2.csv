"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $150 is well above your $100 limit. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, offering significantly less than Alice's initial price. This sets the stage for negotiation and hopefully gets Alice to consider a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** $125 is still above my limit, but I'm willing to negotiate further. There's still room for Alice to lower the price, and I'd rather explore that option before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing willingness to compromise. $95 is still within my budget, and hopefully close enough to Alice's price that she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  $110 is still a bit above my limit. I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price of $100. I have a few more rounds left, so I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm going all in with my final offer, as this is my absolute maximum. It's a gamble, but if Alice is willing to meet me halfway, I can secure the product at a price that works for me. If she rejects, I can always go with John."
