"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price slightly? I am willing to consider offers closer to $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer and for recognizing the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but unfortunately, $1,025,000 is still beyond my current budget. I am willing to offer $975,000 if that could help us reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
