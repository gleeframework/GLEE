"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me the opportunity to get closer to my desired price.  I'm also aware that if Bob rejects, I can always sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for something closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is still a good price for Bob, as he values the product at $12,000, and it's closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my desired range.  It's also better than selling to John for $8,000. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
