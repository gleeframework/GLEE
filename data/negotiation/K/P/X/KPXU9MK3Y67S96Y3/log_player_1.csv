Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit higher, closer to his maximum.
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:**  Offering a price too close to $10,000 might make Bob think the product is worth less or make him feel like he's not getting a good deal.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale with Bob."
