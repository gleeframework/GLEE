"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, as I want to maximize my profit. It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer right away, but it sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $80?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell it for that low.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is too low.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $120? "", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering a price that is a compromise, aiming to find a middle ground. I'm still above my minimum, but showing flexibility to encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $120 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $80. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still far below my minimum. It's time to try and increase the pressure a bit. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $80 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $110, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still above my minimum, and adding a bit of urgency to the situation. This is getting closer to the middle ground, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a good compromise."
