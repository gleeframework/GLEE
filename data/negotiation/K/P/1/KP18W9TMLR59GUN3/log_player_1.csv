Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering a price slightly below my minimum value ($15,000) but above Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Message:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, making it more appealing.
* **John as Backup:** The knowledge that John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me leverage. If Bob doesn't accept my offer, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $12,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I have John as a backup buyer, giving me the luxury of not needing to accept Bob's low offer.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,500). This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to make it clear that $13,500 is still a good deal for him.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I can afford to reject another low offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer. How about $13,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $13,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John is the Safer Option:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum desired profit, and I don't have to risk further negotiation with Bob.
* **Potential for Stalemate:**  Negotiating further could lead to a stalemate, potentially leaving me with nothing if Bob becomes unwilling to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,250 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference again, and I offer the product for $13,375?  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13375}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This approach maintains a sense of fairness and compromise while moving closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $13,375 is still above my minimum of $15,000, so I'm not risking a loss by continuing negotiations.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:**  I reiterate the idea of a ""great deal for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced about the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $13,000? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:**  $13,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob has indicated this is his final offer, suggesting further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price.
* **John is the Safer Option:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit. I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob, potentially ending up with a lower price or a stalemate."
