"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1800000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $1500000. I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering such a unique product, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1000000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1000000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering its true value to me is at least $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1250000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value you place on the product, I'm still unable to meet the price you've offered. I would like to propose $1100000 as a counteroffer. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still not ready to accept $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1200000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
