"Bob, I understand your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth more than that, and I'm confident it will bring you great value. Would you consider $11,000? It's a fair price that reflects the quality and potential of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $11,500 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our positions.",11500.0,Alice,5,
