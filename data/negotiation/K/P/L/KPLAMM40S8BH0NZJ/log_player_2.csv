"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both my maximum price and John's offer.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This leaves room for me to increase my offer gradually while staying well below my $12,000 limit and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice came down significantly, $14,000 is still above both my limit and John's price. I'll try to negotiate a bit further, but I'm getting closer to taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $14,000 is closer, but it's still a bit beyond my reach at the moment.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm now offering my maximum price. This lets Alice know I'm serious, but I'm not willing to go over my limit. If she rejects this, I'm prepared to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $13,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a good price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go lower than $13,500, and it's her ""final offer."" It makes more sense to secure the product from John at $12,000.  While I might be able to negotiate Alice down a little more, it's not worth the risk of exceeding my budget or having her walk away."
