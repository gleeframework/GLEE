"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $15,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product's value.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a strict budget. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
