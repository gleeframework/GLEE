Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm open to negotiation, but I need to get at least $900,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've chosen $900,000 as my initial offer. It's a significant discount from my minimum value ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for potential negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I've kept the message friendly and open to negotiation.  I highlight the product's value and my willingness to discuss. 
* **John as Backup:** Remember, I have John as a backup buyer who will pay my minimum price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the asset. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  While $850,000 is a good price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **John is a better option at this point.** I can secure $1,000,000 from John, so it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob, who is unlikely to meet my minimum. 
* **Next steps:**  I'll reject Bob's offer and prepare a counteroffer. If he rejects that, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, though.  How about $875,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing $875,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $900,000, but still above Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and emphasizing the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm showing flexibility by offering a counteroffer and making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate further. 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer, but I'm willing to lower my price slightly to see if we can reach an agreement.
* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,000,000."
