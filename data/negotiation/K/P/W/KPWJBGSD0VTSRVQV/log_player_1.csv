"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This price is fair considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1500000, which is the maximum I can pay. If you're serious about selling, I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum price. It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
