"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This price is fair considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1500000, which is the maximum I can pay. If you're serious about selling, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
