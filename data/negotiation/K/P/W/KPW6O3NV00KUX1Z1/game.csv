"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident that this offer represents a fair deal for both of us, considering the significant return on investment you'll experience.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the time you've taken to consider my potential investment in this product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would be a more reasonable investment for me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking to get a good price for your product, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your initial offer and my previous counteroffer. How about we try $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's settle at $1,375,000. This offer represents a significant investment on your part, but I'm confident it will yield even greater returns for you in the long run.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,325,000? This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
