"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for potential gains and sets the stage for a back-and-forth. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and enthusiastic message can help build rapport and make Bob more open to negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offers:** I'm not aiming for a hard-sell.  By offering a price that leaves room for negotiation, I invite Bob to engage and increase the likelihood of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value is Still High:** While $100 is a significant improvement, the product is worth $150 to Bob.  There's still a chance to get closer to that value with further negotiation.
* **Potential for Gain:** Rejecting the offer allows me to explore if Bob is truly willing to pay closer to my desired range. 
* **Selling to John:**  While $80 is a safe bet, it's significantly lower than the potential I see with Bob.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to work with you, $100 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $110? Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Flexibility:** Offering to split the difference shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and positive tone encourages Bob to continue the conversation.
* **Moving Towards a Deal:**  The counteroffer is closer to my desired price, making it more appealing while still leaving room for Bob to potentially negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:**  Bob has moved closer to my desired price. While $105 is still below my initial ask, it's a substantial improvement over his previous offers.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance I might not get a better deal. There's also the risk of Bob getting frustrated and walking away altogether. 
* **Selling to John:** At this point, selling to John for $80 would be a significant loss compared to accepting Bob's offer. 

It's time to secure a reasonable profit. Accepting this offer is the best decision at this stage, considering the potential risks of further negotiation."
