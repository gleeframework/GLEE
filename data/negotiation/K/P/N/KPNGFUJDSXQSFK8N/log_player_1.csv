Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000):** This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's lower than the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000):** This incentivizes Bob to accept and potentially make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. 

By offering a price slightly closer to my minimum, I'm showing I'm serious about selling, but also leaving room for a profitable deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate for a higher price.  $1,100,000 is still significantly below the product's worth to Bob, and I'm confident I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. It's a fair compromise and still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,150,000, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? I'm willing to compromise and make it a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,225,000 is a good compromise. It's above my initial offer of $1,200,000 and closer to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer will ensure a quick sale and a profit that exceeds my minimum goal. 

While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal to John or Bob walking away entirely outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
