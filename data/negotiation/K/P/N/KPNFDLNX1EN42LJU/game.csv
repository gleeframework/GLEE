"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to $1,350,000 to make this work.  This price still leaves you with a good deal, considering the value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $1,350,000. How about we meet at $1,250,000? That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. How about we meet at $1,250,000 again? I'm willing to pay that price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to $1,250,000.  To make this work, I can come down to $1,275,000. It's a compromise from my end, but still a profitable deal for me. I'm hoping we can finalize this in the next few rounds.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle at $1,275,000 is not acceptable, but I can do $1,250,000 is not acceptable either, so I'll meet you at $1,260,000",1260000.0,Bob,8,
