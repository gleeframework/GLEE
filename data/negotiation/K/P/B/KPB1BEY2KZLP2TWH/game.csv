"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $820,000. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",820000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher. It can truly transform your business, and $820,000 doesn't reflect its true potential.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the immense value it brings.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice, and I respect your perspective on the product's value. However, after evaluating our budget constraints, I am unable to increase my offer beyond $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,4,
