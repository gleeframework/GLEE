"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can offer you a compromise - I'll meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not quite ready to accept $1,000,000, Bob. I'm willing to go a bit higher than that. How about we meet at $1,050,000? This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
