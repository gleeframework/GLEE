"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially since I have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $100 to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $87.50, but no higher than that. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $87.50 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I still have 6 rounds to negotiate and potentially get a higher offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $89? It's only a dollar more than your offer, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go up to $89, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $87.50. How about $88.75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to push for a higher price, we're already in round 6 and time is running out. Accepting $88.75 is still a good deal, especially considering John will only offer $80. It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing the deal and getting stuck with John's lower offer."
