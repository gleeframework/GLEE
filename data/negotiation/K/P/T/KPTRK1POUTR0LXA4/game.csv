"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice. I'm interested in this product, but $1200000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get a great price. Let's aim for a final agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $1150000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a substantial profit while giving me a good deal. Let's try to close this deal and avoid further back and forth.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the wire, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I can offer you the product for $1080000. This is a compromise that gets me closer to my minimum price, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product brings to you.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
