"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle somewhere around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. Let's aim for a price of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts on that?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
