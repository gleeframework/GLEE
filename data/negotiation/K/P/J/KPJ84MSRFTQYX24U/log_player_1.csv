{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great price considering its value, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer allows me to make a decent profit ($2,000) while still being potentially appealing to Bob as he can get a good deal ($2,000 off his perceived value).  It also leaves room for negotiation if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think $10,000 is a bit steep for me, but I'm interested in the product. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference at $9,500? This would still give you a good deal, and it's a price I'm willing to work with. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go a bit lower, how about $9,000? I really like the product and I'm willing to meet you at the original price I offered 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'm tempted to negotiate further, I'm confident John will buy the product for my desired price. It's better to secure a guaranteed profit with John than risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower sale price."
