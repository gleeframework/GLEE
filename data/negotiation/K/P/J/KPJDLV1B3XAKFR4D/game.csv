"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $18000? I think that's a fair price considering the value you've mentioned.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $18000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $19000?  This reflects the true value of the product and still leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $19000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $18500. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value you've mentioned and the initial offer. What do you think?",18500.0,Bob,4,
