"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant move towards my target price of $1,000,000. It's a bold move but still within a reasonable range for Alice to consider, given her own valuation.  It demonstrates my seriousness about acquiring the product while also leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my target price, but I'm still not willing to settle yet.  There's a decent chance that I can get her to come down further, especially since she rejected my counteroffer, suggesting a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer allows me to make another counteroffer and try to close the gap even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $1,050,000.  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still staying within a range that's beneficial to me. It's likely that Alice will see this as a reasonable counteroffer, especially after rejecting my previous one. This move should bring us closer to a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $1,125,000, which is significantly closer to my target price of $1,000,000 and within my budget of $1,500,000.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or me missing out on the deal altogether is now higher.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product, as it represents a good compromise."
