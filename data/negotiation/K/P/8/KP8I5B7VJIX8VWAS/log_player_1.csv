Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet halfway and settle on $16,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $16,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $12,000.  This is the best I can do. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly anchored at $12,000 and unwilling to budge. It's unlikely further negotiation will get us significantly closer to our desired price. Accepting his offer is a $3,000 loss compared to John's offer.  It's in our best interest to cut our losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
