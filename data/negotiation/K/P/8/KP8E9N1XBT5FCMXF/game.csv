"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's potential value, $1,200,000 is outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,020,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,020,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000 for the product, which is my final offer.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go below $1,020,000. However, I'll make one more attempt to reach a deal. I'll meet you at $1,015,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1,200,000.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
