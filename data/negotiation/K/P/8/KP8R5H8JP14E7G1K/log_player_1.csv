"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum price of $80, but it also leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm ready to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to me, but I am only willing to pay up to $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than $80 from John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point of $100.  I'm going to try and negotiate a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 
 
I'm offering $95.  It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still allows me to get a good price for the product. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I am comfortable to pay $92 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $95,  $92 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for only $80.  It's time to secure the sale!"
