Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, making the offer seem more attractive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer, which will allow me to gauge his interest and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the evolving dynamics of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. It's still a significant discount from its value to me, but I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial financial loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's offer is below my minimum, it shows he's willing to negotiate. There's potential to reach a more favorable price through counter-offers. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage in the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 gives me the confidence to be more assertive in the negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still offers you a significant discount, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $950,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer, but it also shows that I'm open to negotiation. This demonstrates good faith and willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the discount Bob is getting, making the offer seem more appealing. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm reframing the negotiation around finding a solution that benefits both of us. This helps to build rapport and encourages Bob to see the value of reaching an agreement.

**Important Note:**  I'm monitoring Bob's responses closely. If he continues to push for a price significantly lower than $950,000, I'm prepared to either make a final counteroffer or move on to John to secure the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While it's still not ideal, it's a significant improvement from his previous offers.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob completely or taking too long.  Accepting his offer allows me to secure a sale quickly.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not under immense pressure to accept a lower price. This gives me the confidence to accept Bob's offer.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Building a positive relationship with Bob could lead to future business opportunities, even if this deal isn't ideal.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale that's close to my minimum price while minimizing the risk of further negotiation and potential delays."
