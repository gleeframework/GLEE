"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  He values the product at $150, and Alice's offer is still above her value of $120. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $125. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $135 is still a good deal for Bob. It's below his maximum price of $150 and closer to his desired price of $125. While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might reject his next counteroffer, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
