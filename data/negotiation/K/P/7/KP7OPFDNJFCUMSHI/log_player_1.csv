Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product which I know will be very valuable to you, for $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you aim to get as much as possible from Bob, who values the product at $15,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum. It also provides Bob with a perceived discount, making the deal more appealing."
