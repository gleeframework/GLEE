Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** My message is friendly and focuses on the value the product offers to Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open.

**Strategy:**

I want to maximize my profit while still potentially securing a deal with Bob.  Starting with a higher price allows for potential concessions, while also making it clear that I won't undervalue the product. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer.  If the negotiation drags on or becomes unproductive, I'll have the option to sell to John for my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation opportunity:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does show interest. This opens an opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Risk of losing John:**  Selling to John guarantees my desired price, but it also eliminates the possibility of negotiating a higher price with Bob.  

**Strategy:** 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to get closer to my desired price. I'll need to assess how willing Bob is to negotiate further and adjust my counteroffer accordingly. If Bob refuses to budge, I'll be prepared to sell to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $8,500 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still being significantly above his initial price.
* **Highlighting value:**  I reiterate the potential value of the product for Bob.
* **Positive framing:** My message remains friendly and encourages further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer is a way to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further. If he accepts, I've secured a profitable sale. 
* **Leaving room for more concessions:** If he rejects, I can still lower the price slightly in the next round, but only if necessary.
* **Keeping John as a backup:**  I'm still prepared to sell to John if Bob's counteroffers remain too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground. How about we settle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to acceptable:** $7,500 is still below my desired minimum of $12,000, but it's closer than Bob's previous offer. 
* **Risk of losing John:**  By continuing to negotiate, there's a chance I could lose John as a buyer, who is willing to pay my full price.
* **Time is money:**  Every round of negotiation takes time and effort.  

**Strategy:**

* **Secure a deal:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and brings in a significant amount of money.
* **Minimize potential loss:** While I'm not getting my desired price, $7,500 is a decent profit considering Bob's initial offer.
* **Time efficiency:**  Accepting now avoids further negotiation and the risk of a prolonged process."
