"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant step towards my maximum budget of $800,000. It shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but am also firm on my price limit. This should encourage further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still significantly higher than my maximum budget. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of going back and forth for longer is high, potentially leading to a higher price or a broken deal. Buying from John guarantees a price within my budget and avoids further negotiation time."
