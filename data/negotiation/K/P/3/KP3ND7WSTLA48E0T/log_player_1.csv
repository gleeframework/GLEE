Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a significant return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By initially offering the product at $1,500,000 (a 25% markup), Alice leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price above her minimum. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message highlights the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's potential profit.
* **Exclusivity:**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" aims to make the offer seem more desirable and time-sensitive, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice is secure knowing she has John as a guaranteed buyer at her minimum acceptable price if Bob declines. 

This strategy allows Alice to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a price significantly higher than her minimum."
