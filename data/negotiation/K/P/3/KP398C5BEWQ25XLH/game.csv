"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $90. I'll offer you the product for $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $102.50. It's still a good deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $2.50. Let me know if you're interested.",102.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my budget limit. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, and that's my final offer. Please let me know if you're willing to accept it.",100.0,Bob,6,
