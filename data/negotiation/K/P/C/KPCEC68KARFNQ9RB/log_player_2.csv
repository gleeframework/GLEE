Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so he should aim for a lower price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need $11000 to make it worth my while. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still get the product from John for $10,000, which is a better deal than $11,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but if she won't go lower, John is still a viable option."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $11000. How about we meet at $11200? I think it's a fair compromise

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice is willing to negotiate, she's not willing to go low enough for Bob to save any money.  He's better off buying the product from John for $10,000."
