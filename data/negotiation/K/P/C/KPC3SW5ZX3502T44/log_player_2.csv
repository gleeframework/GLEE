"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $95. This means there's room for negotiation. 
* You're willing to pay up to $100, so you have some leverage. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is still asking for more than the product is worth to her, suggesting she has room to negotiate. 
* You're willing to pay $100, so rejecting her offer allows you to continue trying to get a better price.
* A counteroffer may be successful in getting a price closer to your desired $85."
