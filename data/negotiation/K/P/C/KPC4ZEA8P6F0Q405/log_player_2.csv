Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $1,500,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This offer takes into account the product's potential but still ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I need to be firm on my end.  My final offer is $1,250,000. This is a very competitive price considering the value this product will bring. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000.  You can get the product for a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, saving you $250,000.  It's time to cut your losses with Alice and go with the sure thing."
