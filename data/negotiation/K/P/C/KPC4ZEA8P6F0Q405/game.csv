"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $1,500,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This offer takes into account the product's potential but still ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,350,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I need to be firm on my end.  My final offer is $1,250,000. This is a very competitive price considering the value this product will bring.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
