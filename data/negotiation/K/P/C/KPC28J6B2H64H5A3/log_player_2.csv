Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems like we both see the value in this product. To get this deal done, how about we settle at $8,200? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000, and you're better off taking the guaranteed deal from John.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a higher risk of ending up with no deal or a price higher than John's offer."
