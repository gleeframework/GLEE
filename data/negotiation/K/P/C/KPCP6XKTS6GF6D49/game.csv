"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $90 is a bit outside my budget. How about $75? It's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $82, which is a great compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $82 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to purchase the product.",80.0,Bob,4,
