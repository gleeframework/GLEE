Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), but also leaves room for negotiation.  This is because Bob values the product at $1,500,000, making this offer potentially attractive to him. I'm confident in my ability to negotiate further if needed, and I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I am going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer, aiming to close the gap and secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial asking price. I believe this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also ensuring I receive a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit."
