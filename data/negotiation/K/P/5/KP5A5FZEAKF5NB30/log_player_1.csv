Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000. Any price within this range could be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal.  Here's a strategy:

1. **Aim High:**  Start with an offer closer to Bob's maximum value. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down.
2. **Confident Justification:** Provide a reason for your price, even if it's just the product's value to you. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its potential value and the high demand I'm seeing, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,150,000 is a strong opening, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message implies the product is in high demand, justifying the price.
* **No Mention of John:**  You hold the power of a guaranteed sale. Don't reveal your backup plan unless necessary. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower, but still within the ZOPA.
* **Relationship:**  If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a more moderate starting point could be beneficial."
