"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'll find it very useful. My initial price is $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Room for compromise:** This price allows for potential compromise in the later rounds if Bob is unwilling to pay $115.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and aims to create a positive starting point for the negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for negotiation:** I still have 9 rounds to potentially reach a higher price. 
* **Strategic rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my desired value.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $105 is a good offer, it's a little lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($115) and Bob's offer ($105). This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to my desired value.
* **Positive language:** The message is friendly and emphasizes fairness, aiming to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Remaining room for compromise:** There's still room to negotiate further if necessary, but this offer is a good starting point for the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit. However, $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $112.50. This is a fair compromise and gives us both some room to breathe."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer closer to my desired value:**  I'm moving closer to my desired price range, but still leaving room for compromise.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final round:** This is the final round of negotiations.
* **Below minimum:** Bob's offer of $109.75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Guaranteed sale:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120, which is higher than Bob's final offer.  It's not worth risking losing a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

It's better to accept the sure thing with John."
