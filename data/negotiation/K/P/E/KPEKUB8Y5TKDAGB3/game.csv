"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'll find it very useful. My initial price is $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you consider that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $105 is a good offer, it's a little lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's fair to both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $107.50? Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit. However, $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $112.50. This is a fair compromise and gives us both some room to breathe.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $112.50. I'm willing to go up to $109, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",109.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $109.  I'm willing to come down to $111.  It's a good price for both of us, and it's getting close to my minimum. What do you say?",111.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $111. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $109 and $111, so how about $110.25? Can you consider that?",110.25,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting very close. I understand your budget, but $110.25 is still just a bit below what I need. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $110.50. It's only a small difference, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",110.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with $110.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $109 and $110.50, so how about $109.75? Can you consider that?",109.75,Bob,10,
