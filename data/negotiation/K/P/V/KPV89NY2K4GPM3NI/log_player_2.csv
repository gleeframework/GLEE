While I'd prefer to pay a bit less, Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is getting close to my target.  We're at the end of the negotiations, and risking another counteroffer might lead to a stalemate. Buying from John would be significantly more expensive.  This is a reasonable price that allows me to acquire the product without overspending."
