{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's perceived value of the product, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum goal of $150. It's also important to be friendly and approachable, so Bob is more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product but I can only go up to $120. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm interested in selling the product to Bob, I need to hold out for a better price.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $145? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit higher than my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $135?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not comfortable selling the product for less than my minimum.  I'll take John's offer of $150 and sell the product to him instead."
