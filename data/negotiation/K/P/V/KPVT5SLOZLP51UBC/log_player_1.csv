Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 remains outside my budget.  To make progress, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring this product.  Let's aim for a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear his maximum budget is significantly lower than what John is willing to pay. It's unlikely Bob will reach $1,500,000 in a reasonable number of rounds.  Therefore, it's in Alice's best interest to cut negotiations short and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
