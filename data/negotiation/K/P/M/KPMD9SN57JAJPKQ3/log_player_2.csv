"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the maximum you're willing to pay is $15,000, and Alice's initial offer is at that price, it's best to try and negotiate a lower price. There's no reason to accept the initial offer, so rejecting it is the best move to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

Starting with a counteroffer of $13,000 is a reasonable first step. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.  It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear expectation of a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to $14,000, which is closer to your target. However, there's still room to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

Since Alice rejected your previous offer of $13,000, it's reasonable to increase your offer slightly to $13,500. This shows you are willing to compromise while still trying to get a better deal than Alice's current offer of $14,000."
