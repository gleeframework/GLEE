Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's maximum valuation is $1,000,000, we want to start with a price above that to leave room for negotiation.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Justification:**  By stating ""its value and potential,"" we subtly imply that the price is justified without explicitly revealing our minimum.

**The Goal:** This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure the highest possible price:** Ideally, Bob might accept the offer outright, or we can negotiate down slightly from $1,150,000.
2. **Maintain the fallback option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, we haven't revealed our minimum price and can confidently sell to John for our desired $1,200,000."
