Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it's worth $100. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering the product at $100, which is $20 more than my minimum value.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price.  I'll be ready to counter if he rejects my offer, but I'll also be watching for opportunities to sell to John if things drag on."
