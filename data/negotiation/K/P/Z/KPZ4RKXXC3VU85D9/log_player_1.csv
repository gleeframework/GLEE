Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point.  Since I don't know anything about the product or Bob's potential value, I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also framing the message in a way that emphasizes the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $75?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $75 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  That's still a great deal for a product like this, and I think it's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $80. That's my final offer, what do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum value for the product.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Bob will go higher, and I risk losing time. It's better to accept his offer now and secure the sale."
