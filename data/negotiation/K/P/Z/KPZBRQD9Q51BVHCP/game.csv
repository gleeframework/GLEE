"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm open to negotiations, but I was thinking of starting with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $980,000. Would that be agreeable to you?",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to your target price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,020,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm ready to buy today if we can land on a price that works for both of us. How about $1,000,000 even?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000 yet. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $1,015,000? This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
