Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, there might be a small window to negotiate slightly downward, but still above my minimum.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while acknowledging the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
