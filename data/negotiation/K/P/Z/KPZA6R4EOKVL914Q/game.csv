"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested, but $8,500 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750. It's a fair price that's within my budget and also allows you to get a good deal. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and I believe it's the best we can do.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,800. This price is a fair compromise and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",8800.0,Bob,6,
