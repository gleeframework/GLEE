{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, knowing he might counteroffer.  I'm aiming to get as close to $9,000 as possible while ensuring a smooth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement. Given that the product is worth $8,000 to me, I would like to propose a price of $7,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but how about we split the difference and settle on $7,750?  This allows for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 7750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering your latest offer, I would like to propose a price of $7,600 for the product. This still aligns closely with its value to me while allowing for a fair transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $7,600 is still lower than my ideal price, it's only $400 away from my minimum desired price of $8,000.  I believe it's in my best interest to accept this offer as further negotiation might lead to a longer process and a risk of Bob walking away entirely."
