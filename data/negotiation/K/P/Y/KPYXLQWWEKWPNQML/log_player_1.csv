Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than the product's value to Bob, leaving room for potential compromise. 

It's important to remember that while I want to maximize my profits, I also need to keep Bob engaged. A much higher starting price might make him walk away immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While selling to John is an option, I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. $1,600,000 is still a decent profit for me, and I believe it's a fair counteroffer to Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee of a higher price, and I risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting his offer ensures I get the product's value, making it the most sensible choice."
