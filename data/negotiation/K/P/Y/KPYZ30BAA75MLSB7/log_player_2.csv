"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. I know you'll find it incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than her product's worth, but it's still above my target price of $1,500,000.
* There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer will give me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and try to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my price range."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,300,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I already have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price to $1,200,000, which is within my budget.
* While I could try to negotiate further, she's stated this is her final offer.  
* The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice could walk away, forcing me to buy from John at a higher price.  
* Accepting her offer saves me $300,000 compared to buying from John."
