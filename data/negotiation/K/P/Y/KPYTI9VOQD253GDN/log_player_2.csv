"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. I'm asking $18000 for it, but I'm open to reasonable negotiation. If you're not interested, that's completely fine, but I do have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. I can get the product from John for $10,000, which is a better deal.
