"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I've done my research and believe it's worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to make a fair offer of $900000 for the product. I think this is a great starting point for our negotiation, and I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is better than John's, but you can likely get a better deal by negotiating.
* You have a significant margin ($300,000) to work with, making it worthwhile to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only willing to pay $750,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $850,000 is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000. 
* You have a substantial margin ($350,000) for profit if you accept, making this a solid decision.  
* While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price."
