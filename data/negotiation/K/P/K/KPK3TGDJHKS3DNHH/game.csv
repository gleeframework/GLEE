"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I've done my research and believe it's worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to make a fair offer of $900000 for the product. I think this is a great starting point for our negotiation, and I'm open to discussing further.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only willing to pay $750000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,
