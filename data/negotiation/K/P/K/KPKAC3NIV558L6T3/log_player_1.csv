Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (reservation price).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Potential Profit:** You have a window of $300,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000) for potential negotiation.

**Strategic Offering**

You want to offer a price that is enticing to Bob while maximizing your profit.  Here's a strategy:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its benefits."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  This offer is significantly below your guaranteed price but well above Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""unique value and potential"" helps justify the high price without explicitly stating its worth to you.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still highly profitable for you. 

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** How Bob responds will determine your next move. Be prepared to negotiate or stand firm depending on his counter-offer.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While you have John as a backup, don't use him as leverage. Keep the negotiation with Bob focused on the product's value."
