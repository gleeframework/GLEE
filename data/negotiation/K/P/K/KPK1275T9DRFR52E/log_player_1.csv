"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 22000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, I'm emphasizing the ""value and potential"" to frame it as a worthwhile investment rather than just a purchase. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me a strong alternative if Bob isn't willing to negotiate fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is much lower. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is his perceived value, which is expected. I need to steer the negotiation towards a price that's beneficial for me. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum but still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (But Not Too Much):** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price significantly from the initial offer. However, I'm still aiming for a price well above both Bob's offer and my minimum. 
* **Justification:** I'm framing this as a ""middle ground"" solution that benefits both parties.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's flexibility. If he's unwilling to budge from $10,000, I know I might need to consider John's offer more seriously as the rounds progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $18,000 is still more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my absolute minimum of $15,000. I need to hold firm to get a price that's acceptable.
* **Negotiation Tactics:** Bob is using phrases like ""absolute maximum"" to create a sense of urgency. However, I have John as a reliable alternative, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer.
* **Time for a Stronger Stance:** I'll need to make it clear in my next counteroffer that I'm getting close to my limit and might walk away from the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. To be completely transparent, $15,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This is already a significant discount on the product's true value.  I believe it's a fair and final offer."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer and it's non-negotiable. This introduces a sense of urgency and seriousness.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating my bottom line while emphasizing the fairness and the significant discount I'm already providing. 
* **Transparency:** By being upfront about my minimum, I'm hoping to build trust and encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  I'm ready to walk away and accept John's offer if Bob doesn't accept. It's essential to stick to my principles and not devalue the product."
