"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $600000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $700000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $700000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $650000. This is a fair price considering our previous discussions and my budget.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $675000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",675000.0,Alice,5,
