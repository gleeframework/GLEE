Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

The key is to aim high without alienating Bob completely. Since you have a backup offer, you can afford to be a bit bolder. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,400,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product. It's a strong opening position.
* **Justification:** While not revealing your hand entirely, hinting at its ""unique value"" and ""other interested parties"" subtly reinforces the idea that this is a desirable item.
* **Time Pressure:**  The ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** Bob might try to negotiate. Be prepared to adjust slightly downward, but don't go below your $1,200,000 safety net. You have a strong position!"
