"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product at the special price of $150. It's a great deal you won't want to miss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to go directly to John."
