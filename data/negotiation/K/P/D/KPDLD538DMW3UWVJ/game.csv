"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to my asking price.  How about $13,000?  This allows me some wiggle room while still being fair to both of us. I'm confident this product will be a valuable investment for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about $11,500? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,500 is a bit too far below my value for the product. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which reflects a compromise on both our ends.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a valuable asset.  What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $11,000? I'm willing to take on some risk to get a good deal, and I think this price is a fair reflection of the product's value to me.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you on the budget constraints, but $11,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $11,750? That's a significant price adjustment on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product will bring you. Let's close this deal - I'm confident you won't regret it.",11750.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $11,250? I'm willing to take on some risk to get a good deal, and I think this price is a fair reflection of the product's value to me.",11250.0,Bob,8,
