"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in it.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while still allowing us to reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal. While $975,000 is closer to a fair price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000. I believe this offer represents the significant value this product holds for you, while still being acceptable on my end.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  I'm willing to pay $985,000. This is a small adjustment from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",985000.0,Bob,6,
