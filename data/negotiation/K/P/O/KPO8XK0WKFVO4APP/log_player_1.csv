Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  I think it's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,500** is a good starting point. It's less than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message** is friendly and straightforward. It emphasizes the value to Bob without being overly aggressive. 
* **This offer allows for negotiation** without immediately going for the highest possible price.  It gives Bob a reason to engage and potentially counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** This is a strategic starting point.  Your next moves will depend on Bob's response and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at $14500. However, I am hoping to stay within a budget of $12000 for this purchase. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is tempting, it's important to remember:

* **Your minimum acceptable price is $12,000.** You can't lose money on this deal. 
* **Bob is already showing a willingness to negotiate.**  His offer is lower than your initial price, but he's not walking away entirely. 
* **There's still room for a better deal.**  You can likely get more than $12,000, considering the value of the product to Bob.

**By rejecting Bob's offer:**

* You demonstrate that you're not desperate to sell at his price.
* You create the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.

**The next step:** You'll need to carefully consider your counteroffer, taking into account Bob's budget and your own desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $13,000? This still allows me a fair profit margin, and I believe it's a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  $13,000 is a compromise, showing you're willing to negotiate. It's  significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but still lower than your starting price.
* **Message:** The message reaffirms your willingness to negotiate and highlights the ""fairness"" of your offer. It also subtly points out that it's a good compromise for *both* of you. 
* **Strategic Consideration:** This counteroffer is a way to test the waters and see how committed Bob is.  If he's serious, he might be willing to come up a bit from his $12,000 offer. If he rejects this, you can consider another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose $12500 as the price for the product. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but still within my budget range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to your minimum acceptable price.**  You can't lose money on this deal, and it's still a good deal for you.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation.**  You might be able to get a little more, but Bob could also walk away entirely.
* **John's offer is lower.** While it's guaranteed, it's less profitable than Bob's offer. 

**By accepting Bob's offer:**

* You secure a sale at a price that's within your desired range.
* You avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection. 

It's a sensible choice to accept Bob's offer and move forward with the sale."
