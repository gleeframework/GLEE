Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since I know the product is worth at least $120 to me, I'm leaving room for negotiation while still seeking a decent price.  Let's see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better price in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  It's a good deal, and I'll take it."
