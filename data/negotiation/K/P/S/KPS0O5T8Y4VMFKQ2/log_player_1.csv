Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold opening, but I'm hoping it will set a strong baseline and leave room for negotiation.  I'm also factoring in that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,600,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a healthy profit for me.  I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,700,000. This is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm also considering that I have only 6 rounds left, and the risk of ending up with John's offer of $1,500,000 is becoming more real."
