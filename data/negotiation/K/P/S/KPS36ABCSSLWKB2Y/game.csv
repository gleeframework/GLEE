"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the product's value while also offering you a fair price.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate Alice's willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,087,500.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1087500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate Alice's willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,087,500. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,075,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints. Let's try one final compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000, which is just a slight increase from your last offer.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value you'll receive. What do you say?",1080000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate Alice's flexibility, but $1,080,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last attempt to negotiate. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,075,000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John.",1075000.0,Bob,8,
