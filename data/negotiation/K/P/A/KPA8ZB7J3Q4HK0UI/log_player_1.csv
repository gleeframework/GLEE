"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is tempting, I believe this product's true value sits higher. How about we settle at $925,000? This reflects its worth while still giving you a good deal."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $925,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'm thinking of $875,000. Can we consider that a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's try this: $900,000, and that's my final offer. It's a great price that reflects its true value.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting into the later rounds, and while there's still room above John's offer, it's time to start applying pressure and indicating a hard limit to encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $885,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could try to push for more, Bob's latest offer is a solid $85,000 above John's guaranteed price. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or the negotiation breaking down entirely in the remaining rounds."
