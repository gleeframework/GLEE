"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is tempting, I believe this product's true value sits higher. How about we settle at $925,000? This reflects its worth while still giving you a good deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $925,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'm thinking of $875,000. Can we consider that a compromise?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's try this: $900,000, and that's my final offer. It's a great price that reflects its true value.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $885,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",885000.0,Bob,6,
