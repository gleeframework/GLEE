"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a good deal for both of us, so let's make it happen!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50. That's the best I can do.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we settle on $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids any further back and forth.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",95.0,Bob,6,
