"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price.  Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, it's always worth attempting to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. Starting with a lower price increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation.  By offering $700,000, Bob leaves room for potential concessions from Alice, allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is significantly closer to Bob's counteroffer of $700,000. This suggests that further negotiation might be difficult and time-consuming.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that is much lower than John's offer, achieving the goal of saving money."
