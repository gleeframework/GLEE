```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $108. It's a great price for a high-quality product like this, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. $108 is within your budget, and it's a good deal considering you're close to your target price of $100.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will walk away or you'll run out of rounds. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the opportunity completely."
