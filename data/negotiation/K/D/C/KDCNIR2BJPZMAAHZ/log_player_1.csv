Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and while my asking price is $1,450,000, I'm open to discussing a figure that benefits both of us. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price slightly below my guaranteed sale price to John ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This makes Bob aware I value the product highly.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""open to discussing""  signals willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob encourages him to consider the potential benefits, even at a price exceeding his initial valuation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer aims to secure a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation while leaving room for negotiation before resorting to selling to John."
