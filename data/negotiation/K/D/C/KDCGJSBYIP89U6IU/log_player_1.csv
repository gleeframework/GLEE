Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This gives you room to negotiate if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Value justification:**  While brief, the message hints at the product's value without revealing too much. 
* **Sense of urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive or dislikes negotiation, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Market dynamics:**  While not explicitly stated, understanding the broader market for similar products could influence your pricing strategy."
