"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me, and still a good value for you.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $950,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $980,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $980,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,015,000. This is a fair price that's closer to your offer, and still allows me to get a decent return on my investment.",1015000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,015,000. How about $990,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",990000.0,Bob,6,
