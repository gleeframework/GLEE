"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to emphasize potential value to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for discussion and counteroffers. 

I want to see if I can secure a good price early on, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and also lower than my initial offer of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's willing to negotiate. I believe I can still get a better price. 
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a secure option, I'm hoping to maximize my profit through negotiation with Bob. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a middle ground by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Win-Win Framing:** I'm emphasizing that this deal is beneficial for both of us. 

I'm trying to find a price point that's acceptable to Bob while still maximizing my profit."
