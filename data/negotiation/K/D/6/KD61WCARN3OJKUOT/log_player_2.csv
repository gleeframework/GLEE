{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2

```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $12,000 to show that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to compromise.  I'm also emphasizing the possibility of finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my initial price. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $15500. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,500. I'm willing to offer $14,500.  This would be my final offer. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to show that I'm still serious about buying the product. However, I'm also setting a clear limit and stating that this is my final offer. This gives Alice a strong incentive to accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go below $16000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $16250. This is my final offer. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $16,250 is still above my budget.  I've already negotiated for 6 rounds, and I'm not willing to go higher than $14,500. It's time to move on to John's offer of $12,000, which fits within my budget. Even though it's not the best possible price, it's the most financially responsible choice at this point."
