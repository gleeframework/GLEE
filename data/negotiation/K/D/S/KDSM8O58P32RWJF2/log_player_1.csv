""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential profit margin of $200,000 ($1,000,000 - $800,000).

By offering the product at $925,000:

* **High likelihood of acceptance:** Bob gains a $75,000 discount, making it a compelling deal.
* **Maximizing profit:** You secure a significant portion of the potential profit margin, earning $125,000 more than your fallback option.

The message also introduces a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially influencing Bob to accept quickly."
