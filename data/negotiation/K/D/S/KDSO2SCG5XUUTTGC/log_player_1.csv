Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. "",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $15,000. 
* **John's Offer:**  You have a guaranteed offer for $15,000 from John.

Since you know Bob values the product, you start with a price higher than both John's offer and your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, while ensuring that if he accepts, you maximize your profit."
