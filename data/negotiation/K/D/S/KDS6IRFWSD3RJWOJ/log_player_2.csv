"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and well above my minimum. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great:** It's below your maximum, but you can likely get a better deal.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  You have a clear advantage in this negotiation. Alice's offer is significantly above her minimum, leaving room for you to negotiate.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Buying from John is a guaranteed outcome, but it's the most expensive option. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price from Alice. 

**Next Steps:** You'll need to formulate a counteroffer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down to $1,000,000.  However, I'm still looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for both of us, as it's well above your minimum and significantly below my maximum. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's still a good deal for her as it's well above her minimum. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering $900,000, we're leaving space for further negotiation if Alice wants to counter.
* **Clear communication:** The message highlights the benefit of the offer for both parties.

**Next Steps:**

* Wait for Alice's response. She can either accept your counteroffer, reject it, or make a new counteroffer. 
* Be prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we split the difference and agree on $950,000? This is still a great deal for you, as it's significantly below your estimated value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal for you:**  $950,000 is significantly below your maximum price of $1,200,000. 
* **Fair compromise:** Alice has met you halfway, and this is a good compromise.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While you could try to negotiate further, you risk Alice walking away and you'd have to buy from John at a higher price.

**Next Steps:** 

* Accept Alice's offer and finalize the purchase."
