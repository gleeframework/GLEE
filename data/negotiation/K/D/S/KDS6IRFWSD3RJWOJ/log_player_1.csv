Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down to $1,000,000.  However, I'm still looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for both of us, as it's well above your minimum and significantly below my maximum. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
