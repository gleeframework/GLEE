"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $10,000 by you. I am proposing to sell it to you for $9,500. I believe this price offers a great value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

This is a great deal! Alice is offering the product for less than your maximum price and even lower than what John is offering."
