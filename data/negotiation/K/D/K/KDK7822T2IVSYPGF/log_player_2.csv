"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is far above his budget of $8,000. There are more rounds of negotiation, and he can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is far too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still significantly higher. There's no reason for him to accept it yet, especially since he has more rounds to negotiate and can always opt for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this transaction. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He has more rounds to negotiate and can always choose to buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, as I'm making a significant increase from my previous offer and you're coming down from your previous offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's already willing to pay $10,000, and Alice is only offering a $500 reduction. There's still room to negotiate for a better price, and he can always buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still slightly above what I can afford. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $10,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  

Here's why:

* **Alice's final offer is still too high.** While she's come down in price, $10,250 is still more than Bob's preferred price of $10,000.
* **Only one round left.**  There's little chance that Bob will get Alice to go lower in the final round.
* **John offers a better price.**  John's price of $8,000 is the best deal available. 

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and John's offer gives him the most significant savings."
