"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your product is valuable, but I am only able to pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,250. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly the minimum I'm willing to accept.  While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk he'll walk away, and I'd have to settle for the $10,000 from John.  It's better to secure the deal at this point."
