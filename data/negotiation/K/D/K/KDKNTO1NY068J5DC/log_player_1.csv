"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts high but leaves room for negotiation. It signals that I'm willing to compromise, while also ensuring I make a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about $12,000? That's a fair compromise, and it still gives you a great deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11,500? That's the highest I can go, but I'm really interested in making this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to $12,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer again, but I'll need to be mindful that we're getting close to the number of rounds. If we don't reach an agreement soon, I may need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about the budget. $11,500 is definitely getting closer.  To make this work for me, I'd need to come down to $11,800.  This is my final offer, and it's a good price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $11,800 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11,600? That's the absolute highest I can go, and I'm really hoping we can make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to $12,000, we're running out of rounds.  Accepting $11,600 ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of selling to John for a lower price."
