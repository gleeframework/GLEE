Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something you're interested in, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $9,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $10,000. Offering it slightly below this at $9,500 gives Bob a good deal while still maximizing Alice's profit. 
* **Urgency:**  By mentioning an ""exclusive opportunity,""  we create a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to accept quickly. 
* **John as Backup:** It's important to note that while we have John as a backup buyer, we shouldn't use that information in negotiations with Bob. Revealing this could weaken our position."
