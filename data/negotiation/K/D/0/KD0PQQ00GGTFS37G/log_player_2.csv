"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $150 or more to you, and while I value it at $120, I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to make you think the product is worth more than it is to her, the offer of $140 is still less than your maximum price of $150 and better than John's offer of $150. Accepting this offer saves you money."
