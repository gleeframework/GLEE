Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value this product offers, $950,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product, which reflects its market value and my current investment capacity. I'm confident this price is fair and mutually beneficial, allowing for a quick and mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

* **Aggressive but realistic:**  This counteroffer starts the negotiation by demonstrating your commitment to a deal while leaving room for compromise.
