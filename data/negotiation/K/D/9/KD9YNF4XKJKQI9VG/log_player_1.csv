Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While John offers a guaranteed $12,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $10,000 positions it as a potential bargain for Bob (considering it's worth $8,000 to him) while still leaving a significant profit margin for you. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message is framed as a starting point, implying a willingness to discuss the price further if Bob shows interest.

This approach aims to secure the best possible outcome for Alice."
