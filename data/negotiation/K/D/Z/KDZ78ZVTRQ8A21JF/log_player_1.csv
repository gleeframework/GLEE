I'm offering the product to Bob for $175. This is a starting point, and I'm open to negotiation, but I won't go below $150. If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer, but I also have John as a backup buyer willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I'd like to sell the product, $145 is below my minimum price. I'll counter with a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway at $155. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $148. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $148
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While Bob has come up slightly, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not confident he'll budge further, and John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price."
