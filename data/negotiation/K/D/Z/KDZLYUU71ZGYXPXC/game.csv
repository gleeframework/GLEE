"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2,300,000 is well above my budget. Given the product's worth to me, I can offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $2,100,000. This offer reflects the product's potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,100,000 remains out of my price range. I'm still committed to acquiring this product, but I can only offer $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering my own valuation and your need to sell.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
