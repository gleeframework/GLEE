{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you at $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up. Please let me know your decision as soon as possible."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning another potential buyer (John), we incentivize Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid losing out on the deal.
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** While we could ask for a price closer to $1,500,000, there's a chance Bob will reject it outright. Offering a price of $1,300,000 still represents a significant profit margin while increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting. 

This strategy aims to maximize our potential profit while minimizing the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
