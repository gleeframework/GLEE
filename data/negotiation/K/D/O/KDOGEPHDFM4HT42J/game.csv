"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Would you be open to that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the value it will bring to your business.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm prepared to pay $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in this product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to make this happen.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $11,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my initial asking price.",11500.0,Alice,5,
