"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation to save more money.  Rejecting allows for a counteroffer to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  While it's a step in the right direction, there's still room to negotiate. I'll continue to counteroffer in hopes of reaching a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'll meet you at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly, and while it's still a bit higher than my ideal price, it's getting close. Accepting this offer means a significant savings compared to buying from John.  It's a good compromise and a fair deal."
