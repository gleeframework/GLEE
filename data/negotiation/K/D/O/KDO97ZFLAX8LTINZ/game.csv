"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a price that I think is very reasonable, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price that I believe you'll find acceptable, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still allows you to save some money, but also reflects the value of the product to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something more affordable.  Would you be open to $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,300,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $1,280,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
