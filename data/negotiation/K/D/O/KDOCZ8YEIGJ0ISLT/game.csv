"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $600,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  That said, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $750,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $950,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",950000.0,Alice,5,
