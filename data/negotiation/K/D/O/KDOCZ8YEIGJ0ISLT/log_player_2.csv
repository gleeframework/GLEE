Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $600,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  That said, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $750,000?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $750,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $950,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below $900,000. She explicitly stated $950,000 is the lowest she'll go. Rather than risk the negotiations failing and potentially ending up with nothing, it's the safest option to buy from John for $800,000.  This guarantees you get the product at the best possible price."
