"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $115.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $115 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you leave open the possibility of her making a lower counter-offer.  This strategy maximizes your potential savings."
