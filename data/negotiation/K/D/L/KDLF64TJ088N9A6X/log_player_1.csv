I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me a good profit. I'm hopeful that he'll find the value proposition compelling, but I'm prepared to counter if he rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $17,000 is a decent price, I'm not ready to sell just yet. I believe I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering Bob's offer with $18,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway. I believe this price is still fair, while also demonstrating my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still not ready to sell for $16,500.  I believe I can get a better price, and I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering Bob's offer with $17,500. This is a small compromise, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer, as it's still above my minimum and a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm no longer confident I can get a better price from Bob. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, the risk of further negotiation back and forth isn't worth it.  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed sale and ensures I meet my minimum requirement."
