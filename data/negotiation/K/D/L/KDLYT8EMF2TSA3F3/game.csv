"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product to me. Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $950,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
