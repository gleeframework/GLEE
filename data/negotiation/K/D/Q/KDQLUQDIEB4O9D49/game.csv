"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this reflects the product's true worth and allows for a fair deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your desired price.  Let's try to find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
