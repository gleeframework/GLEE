"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an exceptional opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its intrinsic value and the benefits it offers, I am confident it would be a valuable addition to your endeavors.

To make this opportunity even more appealing, I am offering you the chance to purchase this product at a special introductory price of $950,000. This represents a significant saving compared to the market value, which stands at $1,200,000.

Please consider this offer carefully. If you decide to proceed, please let me know, and we can arrange the details for a smooth transaction.

Thank you for considering my proposal. I look forward to the possibility of working together.

Best regards,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below her stated market value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at $800,000, making Alice's offer unattractive."
