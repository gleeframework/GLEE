"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Friendly tone:**  Using a friendly and positive tone helps establish a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and even below my initial offer of $1,200,000.
* **More negotiation needed:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range. There are still 8 rounds left, giving me time to negotiate further.

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my desired price but still within a reasonable range for him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I've dropped the price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $1,000,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, but it's a price I'm willing to accept for now.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation going smoothly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm ready to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a higher offer:** While I'm open to negotiating, I believe Bob might be willing to go higher. We are getting closer, and I don't want to settle too quickly. 
* **Plenty of rounds left:** With 6 rounds remaining, there's still time to explore further negotiation. 

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above his current offer, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $950,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000.
* **Emphasizing a fair deal:** I'm framing the offer as a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Urgency to close:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting we ""finally close this deal.""

**Next steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider my options. If I believe we're close to a deal, I might make another counteroffer. However, if I feel Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price, I will strongly consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is getting closer, I'm still only able to offer $925,000. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Final offer from Bob:** Bob has stated this is his ""final offer,"" which may create a sense of urgency and make him less likely to budge.
* **Risk of missing out on higher price:**  If I accept this offer, I'll be leaving a significant amount of money on the table. Selling to John at $1,500,000 is still a very attractive option. 
* **Rounds remaining:** With 4 rounds left, I have time to explore other options.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired range but acknowledging Bob's budget constraints. If Bob refuses, I will seriously consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is a compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm only dropping my price by $10,000, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to accept a significantly lower price.
* **Highlighting compromise:** I emphasize that this offer is a compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Urgency to finalize:** I reiterate the need to ""finalize this and move forward,""  creating a sense of urgency to close the deal.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, we close the deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John. The remaining rounds are limited, and I don't want to risk losing a good deal with John."
