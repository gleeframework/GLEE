Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, still well above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""potential worth"" to entice Bob.

**Why not higher?**  While Bob values it at $1,500,000, starting too high could make him immediately reject the offer without considering a counter-proposal."
