"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I recognize its value, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1050000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's worth to both of us. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $1050000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1150000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
