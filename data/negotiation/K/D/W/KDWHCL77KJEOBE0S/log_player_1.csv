Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I recognize its value, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1050000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's worth to both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
