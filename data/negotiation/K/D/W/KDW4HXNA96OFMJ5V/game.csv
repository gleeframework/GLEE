"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product.  Let's make this deal happen!",11500.0,Alice,3,
