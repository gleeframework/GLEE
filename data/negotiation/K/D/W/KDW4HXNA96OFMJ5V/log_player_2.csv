"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot more to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.**  
* **There's no guarantee that further negotiation will bring the price down to Bob's acceptable level.**  
* **Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his maximum price point.** 

Even though Bob might be able to negotiate a slightly better price with Alice, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and potentially increasing the price outweighs the potential savings. Buying from John ensures a guaranteed deal within his budget."
