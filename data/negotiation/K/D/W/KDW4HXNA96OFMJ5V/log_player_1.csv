{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot more to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to me, making it more likely that Bob will consider it.  I am willing to negotiate with Bob, but I am also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
