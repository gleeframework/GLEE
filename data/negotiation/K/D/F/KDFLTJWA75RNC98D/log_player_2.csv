Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $120 by you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you not to miss. Let's discuss a fair price. Would you consider purchasing it for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $95. This allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while respecting the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
