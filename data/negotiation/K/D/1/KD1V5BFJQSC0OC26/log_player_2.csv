"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth $14,000 to secure this opportunity. Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product,  $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is still higher than his absolute maximum, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while leaving room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of that, I would like to propose a price of $13,500 for the product. This offers a middle ground between our previous offers. I hope this suggestion will be more suitable for your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $12,000. Bob has room to negotiate further and should try to secure a lower price. There are still several rounds remaining, and rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to close the deal right now at $13,000. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to close the deal, but is still pushing for a lower price. By offering $13,000, he's showing a strong commitment to the deal while still being within his budget. This counteroffer is also a significant step closer to Alice's price, suggesting a willingness to meet halfway."
