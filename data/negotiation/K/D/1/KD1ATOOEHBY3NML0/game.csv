"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This takes into account your budget and still allows me to get a fair price for my product.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. It gives you a good price for your product while still allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's make this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
