Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in.  It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts high but leaves room for negotiation. It also subtly reminds Bob of the product's value to him, which could encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to counter-offer Bob and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $110? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it still feels like a loss for me. John is willing to pay the minimum I'm comfortable with, so I'll take his offer and sell him the product."
