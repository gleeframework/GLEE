"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but I'm hoping we can find a price closer to my budget. How about we aim for $850000? I believe this would still provide a good return for you while allowing me to make the purchase.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 doesn't quite meet my minimum expectation. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, and propose a price of $900000. This price allows for a mutually beneficial transaction and reflects the value we both recognize in this product. I'm open to discussing further, but I'm confident this is a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
