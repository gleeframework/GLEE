Round 2
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but we're still significantly above our minimum. We need to show him we're willing to negotiate but also hold firm on a price closer to the product's value.  We'll try to meet him closer to the middle in the next round."

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting very close to our minimum! He's clearly interested and willing to negotiate. We're only slightly above John's offer now. We'll push for a slightly higher price one more time, but we're ready to take John's offer if needed."
