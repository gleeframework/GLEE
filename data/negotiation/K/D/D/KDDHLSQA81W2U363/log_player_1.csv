{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a good profit for me.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm mentioning the product's ""great value"" to imply it's worth the price. 

This approach aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is offering the minimum I'm willing to accept, which means I'm not getting any profit beyond my minimum.  
* **Negotiation:** While I could accept his offer, I'd like to try and get a better price. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a bit more, especially if he's genuinely interested in the product.
* **Counteroffer:** By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer and continue the negotiation process.

**Next Step:** I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $17,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my initial offer of $20,000 and Bob's offer of $15,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a ""great deal"" for him, implying that the product is worth more than $15,000.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the need for a ""fair price"" for my product, making the negotiation seem like a balanced exchange.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our initial positions and potentially reach an agreement that satisfies both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $17500. How about we meet at $16000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  This is a decent profit, and it's likely that further negotiation might not result in a significantly higher offer.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk that he might lose interest or walk away altogether. 
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing the negotiation could take more time, and it's possible that I could find a better offer from John during that time.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale that is close to my desired price and minimizes risk."
