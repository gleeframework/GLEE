"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. $1,200,000 is still significantly more than the product's value to Alice ($800,000). It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, given its value to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for the product. Can we discuss further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still higher than Bob's desired price point.  There's room for further negotiation as Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 showed Alice is willing to come down. Bob wants to try to get closer to his target price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product. Can we discuss further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's price point, but he's still not willing to accept. He can afford to be a bit more stubborn, as he has several rounds left and he doesn't want to pay more than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm still at $1,000,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll make a final offer of $1,075,000. This is my last concession, and I hope we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting very close to Bob's desired price point. While Bob can still try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice will stick to her last offer.  Accepting at this point saves Bob the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's a good balance between saving money and ensuring Bob gets the product."
