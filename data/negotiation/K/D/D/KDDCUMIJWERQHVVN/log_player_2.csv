"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially save money by counter-offering.  He knows the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $9,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. That still gives you a good deal, and I'm sure we can finalize this. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer again.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and she's already come down from her initial asking price.  By continuing to counter-offer, Bob has a chance to get the price even lower."
