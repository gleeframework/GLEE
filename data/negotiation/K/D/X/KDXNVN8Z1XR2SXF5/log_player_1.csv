Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you, and this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so Alice needs to offer a price lower than his valuation but high enough to be profitable.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. Alice can be slightly more aggressive with her pricing to Bob.

By offering the product at $11,999, Alice aims to capture the maximum possible profit from Bob while still making the offer attractive compared to his $10,000 valuation. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything because she has John as a guaranteed buyer."
