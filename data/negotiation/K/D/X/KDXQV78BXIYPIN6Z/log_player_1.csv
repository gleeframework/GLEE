Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6

**Reasoning:**

Bob has indicated this is his final offer, and his price increases are relatively small.  It's unlikely he'll come close enough to the $1,500,000 John is offering. Cutting our losses now and selling to John guarantees us the best possible outcome."
