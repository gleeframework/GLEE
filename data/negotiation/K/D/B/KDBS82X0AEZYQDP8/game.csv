"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that the product's value to you is even higher than that, so I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
