"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is far too high.  Bob should reject the offer and counteroffer a much lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, my original offer reflects the true value and potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

Alice's offer is still too high, even with a reduction. Bob is better off buying from John for a much lower price."
