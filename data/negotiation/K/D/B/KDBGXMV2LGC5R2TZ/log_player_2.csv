"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. You know you can get the product from John for the same price. It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong negotiating position and leaves room for compromise.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, but there's still room for improvement.  It's worth trying to push for a lower price before accepting or resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:** 

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,150,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating but also demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise.  The goal is to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,250,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and saves me $250,000 compared to buying from John."
