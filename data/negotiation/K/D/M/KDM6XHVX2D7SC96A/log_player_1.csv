Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $800000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. This is a fair price considering I'm still paying a premium for the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the premium you're willing to pay. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
