Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $925,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal.

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $985,000, and you're running out of rounds. John's offer of $1,000,000 is your best bet at this point to ensure you get the product without overpaying."
