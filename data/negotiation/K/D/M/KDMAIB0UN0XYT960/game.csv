"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $115? I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $115 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. It's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a little hesitant about $125.  How about we split the difference and settle on $120? That way we both get a fair deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
