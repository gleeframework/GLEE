Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message also leaves the door open for further discussion and negotiation. 

I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum value of $12,000, but I'm also prepared to negotiate and possibly accept a lower price if it means a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Could we possibly come to an agreement within this range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he acknowledges the product's value and is open to negotiation. This suggests there might be room for a counteroffer that would be more favorable to me.
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John is always an option, but I want to exhaust the negotiation with Bob first.  John's offer is my fallback if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product.  While $8,000 is below what I'm hoping to get, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing $9,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm taking his budget limitations seriously.
* **Highlighting the Value:** I'm reminding Bob about the value of the product to emphasize that $9,500 is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I am still looking to keep the price at $8,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Persistent Low Offer:** Bob has remained firm at $8,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Time is Money:**  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a price closer to my minimum.  
* **Secure a Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired $12,000, securing a profitable sale.

While I prefer to make a sale to Bob, his unwillingness to budge means it's more efficient to move on and accept John's offer."
