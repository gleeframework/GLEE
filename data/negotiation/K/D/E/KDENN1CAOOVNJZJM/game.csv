"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to start with this offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is considerably below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,075,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while still being a good deal for you. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,025,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
