"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I've got to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a good deal:** $11,500 is significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **The negotiation has progressed:** Alice has already lowered her price from $12,000 to $11,500. Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk Alice will walk away, leaving Bob with no option but to buy from John.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** Accepting the offer ensures a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing the opportunity to buy from Alice."
