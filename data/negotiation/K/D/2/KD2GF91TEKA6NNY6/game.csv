"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still sticking to my budget of $10,000.  I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,400?",10400.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,400 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,700?  This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",10700.0,Alice,5,
