"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for negotiation or allows you to purchase from John at a lower price."
