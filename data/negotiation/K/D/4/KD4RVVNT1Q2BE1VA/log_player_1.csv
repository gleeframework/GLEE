Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Ensure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down, selling at $1,100,000 still yields a much higher profit than selling to John for $800,000.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale to John if Bob declines."
