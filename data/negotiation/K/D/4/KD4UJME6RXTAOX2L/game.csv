"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Could you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This recognizes the value it holds for you while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,075,000. Would you be willing to meet at that price point?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
