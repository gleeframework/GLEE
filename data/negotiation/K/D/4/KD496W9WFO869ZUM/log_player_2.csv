It's not worth paying $90 for a product you value at $80.  You can get it from John for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to either make a counteroffer or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, while still being within your budget and leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79

Alice has lowered her price to $79, which is within your budget and a better deal than buying from John for $80. It's worth accepting this offer."
