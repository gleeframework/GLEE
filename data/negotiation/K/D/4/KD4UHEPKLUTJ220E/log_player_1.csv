Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a price close to your minimum ($15,000) but lower than that allows room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.  
* **Appeal to Value:** The message doesn't explicitly mention Bob's perceived value ($8,000). Instead, it focuses on framing the product as ""fantastic"" and ""valuable,"" hoping to potentially shift his perception. 
* **Time Sensitivity (Implied):**  While not explicitly stated, the fact that you have another buyer (John) creates a subtle sense of urgency. Bob might be more inclined to accept a price closer to your asking price if he believes the product could be sold elsewhere. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might need to start with a lower price.
* **Risk Tolerance:** There's always a risk Bob could reject your offer. You're balancing a higher potential profit with the certainty of John's offer."
