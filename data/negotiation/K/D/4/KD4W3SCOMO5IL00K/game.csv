"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,575,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1575000.0,Alice,5,
