Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant benefits it will bring to your operations."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high at $925,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while staying comfortably above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Time Sensitivity (Implied):**  By mentioning it's a ""unique"" opportunity and an ""initial"" offering, it subtly implies that this offer might not last forever, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes some degree of risk tolerance. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, leading you to sell to John for $800,000. However, the potential for a significantly higher profit justifies the slightly riskier opening move."
