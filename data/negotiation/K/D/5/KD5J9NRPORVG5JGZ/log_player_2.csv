"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As the product is worth $800,000 to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a good deal, it's still above the maximum I'm willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're presenting, I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000 on this.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe you'll find it a great investment.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is within my budget and is a good compromise. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she could reject my offer and I'd end up paying the full $800,000 to John. Accepting her offer secures the product at a good price."
