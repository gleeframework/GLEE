Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  To be frank, $850,000 is just a little too low for me to accept. How about we settle at $925,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while recognizing your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for understanding.  $925,000 is still a bit rich for me. I could potentially make it work at $875,000.  This is a fair offer, considering the value and my budget. Let me know."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your budget constraints.  Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.  What do you say, shall we close the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but her ""final offer"" of $900,000 is still above your maximum budget and John's offer. While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and you risk her sticking to her final offer. Buying from John guarantees you stay within your budget."
