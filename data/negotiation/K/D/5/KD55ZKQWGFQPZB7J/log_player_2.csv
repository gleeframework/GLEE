"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair for both of us. Let's talk about a price of $13,500. This allows you a significant profit margin while still being a great deal for me.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is less than your maximum price, but there's room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer might lead to her proposing a lower price, closer to her product's value of $10,000. You can always fall back on buying from John for $15,000 if Alice doesn't budge."
