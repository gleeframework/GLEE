# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm asking $1500000 for it. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will deliver a strong return.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's initial offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
* There's no information on the product's value, so I'll try to negotiate a lower price. 
* I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so I'm not in a rush to accept the first offer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds intriguing, but $1,500,000 is a steep starting point. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. This reflects the potential value I see, but I need some room to make this a worthwhile investment for me."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 3

```
