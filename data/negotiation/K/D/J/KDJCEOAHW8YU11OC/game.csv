"Alice, your product sounds intriguing, but $1500000 is a steep starting point. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This reflects the potential value I see, but I need some room to make this a worthwhile investment for me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1000000 is a bit too low for me at this point. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This reflects the value I believe the product holds and gives you some room to profit. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1250000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1100000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. How about we meet in the middle at $1150000? This shows my commitment to making this deal work while still ensuring I get a fair price for my valuable product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, your product sounds promising, but $1150000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1125000. This represents a fair compromise and keeps us moving towards a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1125000.0,Bob,6,
