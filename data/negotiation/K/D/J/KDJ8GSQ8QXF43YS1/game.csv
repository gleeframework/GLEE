"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I'm confident that this product is worth more to you than $120. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $155, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good deal for you.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $155 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $145 for the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the market value. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might not be able to find a better deal elsewhere, though.",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're getting a bit anxious, Bob, but I'm not willing to go much lower than $155. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free accessory that normally costs $20, so the effective price would be $135. What do you say?",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extra accessory, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $135 is the right price for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product and the accessory. Let's meet in the middle!",130.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $132.50, but I need to make sure I get a good deal for this product. I'm confident that you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a small concession to get the sale done.",132.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate all your efforts, Alice, but I've reached my budget limit. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product, and that's the highest price I'm willing to pay. If you're willing to accept it, I'll make the purchase. If not, I'll have to look elsewhere.",130.0,Bob,10,
