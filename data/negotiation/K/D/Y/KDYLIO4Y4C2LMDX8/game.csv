"Alice,  Thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $1,700,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to move down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000. This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
