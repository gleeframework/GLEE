"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth significantly more. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your budget and what John is offering. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit too high for my budget right now. Would you be willing to come down to $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price but still leaves room for further negotiation. It aims to:

* **Anchor a lower price point:**  Starting lower can shift the negotiation in your favor.
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** Her response will reveal how much she's willing to budge. 
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  It shows you're serious but also want a fair deal. 

Remember, you always have the option to walk away and buy from John for $8,000 if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice moved closer to your range, $8,500 is still higher than John's offer. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to go up to $7,000, but that's really the most I can do. It's a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Moves closer to a compromise:** You're acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate by increasing your offer while still staying below her price and John's offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""market value,"" you subtly remind Alice of alternative options without directly threatening to walk away.
* **Sets a firm limit:** The phrase ""the most I can do"" signals that you're reaching your upper boundary, pushing Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint. However, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $7,500, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant savings:** You're getting the product for $500 less than John's price and $2,500 less than Alice's initial offer.
* **""Final offer"" signal:**  Alice has indicated this is her bottom line, making further negotiation unlikely.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you push further, Alice might move on to other buyers, and you'll be left with John's $8,000 offer."
