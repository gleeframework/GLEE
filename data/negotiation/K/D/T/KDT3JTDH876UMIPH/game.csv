"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,500? It's a fair compromise, and it still leaves some room for both of us to be happy.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
