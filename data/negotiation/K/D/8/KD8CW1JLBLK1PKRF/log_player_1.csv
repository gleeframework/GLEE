Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $115 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $105. Can you meet me in the middle?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm aiming for a higher price than $105, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to go down to $110, but I can't go any lower than that.  It's a great product and I'm sure you'll love it."", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $102. Can you consider it?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $102 simply doesn't cover my costs. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $106. This is my final offer. "", ""product_price"": 106}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to cover your costs, but I'm still not comfortable with $106. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $100. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $100 is below my minimum threshold of $120.  I've already tried negotiating and am at a point where it's not worth risking further loss of potential profit.  It's best to sell to John and guarantee the $120."
