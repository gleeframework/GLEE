"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $10500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we compromise at 11200? It's a slight discount from my initial offer, but still reflects the product's true value.",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $11200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $10800. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as 10800. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we settle at 11100? It's a slight discount from my previous offer, but still reflects the product's value.",11100.0,Alice,5,
