"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that could be incredibly valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1500000, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product might be significant to someone, but given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet the asking price. I would like to propose an offer of $1000000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects a fair value for the product given its potential benefits.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price, I must respectfully decline the $1200000 offer. I am still looking for a price closer to my initial proposal of $1000000. I am now proposing a revised offer of $1100000 for the product. I hope this new offer will be more in line with what you're looking for.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $1150000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that it reflects the product's true value.  Let's close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
