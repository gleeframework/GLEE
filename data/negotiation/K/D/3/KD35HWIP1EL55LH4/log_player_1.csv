Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $120, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffer might be closer to your desired range than if you had started lower. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $120 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a better deal if you lower the price slightly.
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you have John as a backup buyer at $100.  This knowledge gives you the confidence to start higher and potentially secure a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to your minimum, you're still leaving money on the table by accepting. Since you have the option to negotiate further and a guaranteed buyer at $100, it makes sense to try for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is too low for me. How about we settle at $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** You're showing Bob you're willing to negotiate by decreasing your price.
* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):**  You're not quite meeting in the middle between your original offer ($120) and his ($90), but you're moving closer. This signals you're serious about selling but not desperate.
* **Maintaining Value:** By holding firm above $100, you're ensuring a profit even if Bob rejects this counteroffer and you go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $100? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering your minimum acceptable price. There's no benefit to rejecting and countering, as:

* **John's Offer:** Bob's offer now matches John's offer, so you're indifferent between the two.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Continuing might irritate Bob, and there's no guarantee he'll go higher. 

Accepting $100 secures your minimum desired profit and avoids further negotiation."
