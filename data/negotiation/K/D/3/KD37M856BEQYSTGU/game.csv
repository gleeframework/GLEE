"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a fair price considering the value to you, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's a price I know I can afford.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
