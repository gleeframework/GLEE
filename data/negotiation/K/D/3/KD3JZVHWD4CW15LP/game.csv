"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price for my product. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $1,150,000. Let's meet at $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can offer $1,075,000. Can you meet me at this price?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,075,000 is still too far off from what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,087,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to save a bit. How about $1,075,000 is still a bit too high, but $1,082,500 is more reasonable for me. Can you meet me at this price?",1082500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference and settle at $1,085,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",1085000.0,Alice,7,
