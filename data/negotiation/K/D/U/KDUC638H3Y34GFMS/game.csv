"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $100? That's the most I can justify spending right now.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that low. I'm willing to meet you at $110, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
