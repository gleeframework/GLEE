Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I know it's of considerable value to you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get closer to Bob's perceived value of $800,000 to maximize my profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 creates a significant profit margin for me ($300,000) while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other potential buyers creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly."
