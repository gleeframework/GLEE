,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I need. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating, but $920,000 is still not enough for me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $940,000,  which is a good middle ground. This will allow us to close the deal without me having to go to John. What do you say?",940000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles here. $915,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $930,000. This is my final offer. If you reject it, I'll be forced to move on to another buyer who values the product more.  Let's make a decision and get this done.",930000.0,Alice,7,
