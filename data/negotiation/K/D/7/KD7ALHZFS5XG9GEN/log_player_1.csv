"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, especially since I have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm dropping my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my valuation.  I believe this is a fair offer, and it gives Bob some room to potentially counter without feeling like he's getting a raw deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my valuation, and I'm getting a little nervous about the time ticking away.  I've had two rounds where I've been close to the $1 million offer from John, and I don't want to risk losing out on the opportunity.  I'm going to accept this offer and secure the sale."
