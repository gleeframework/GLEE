"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that is significantly below its true market value. I'm confident it would be a tremendous asset to your company, given its potential to generate substantial profits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.  This is a price that is more than fair, considering the product's worth to you. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested party willing to pay $800,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
