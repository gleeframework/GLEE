"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum.  This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price we're both comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking for a price closer to $100. Can we negotiate towards that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject it and see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $137.50. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 137.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can still find a middle ground. How about we aim for $120? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but still within your original asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$120 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $120 is still too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again. How about $128.75? This is a fair price that's closer to your offer, but still allows me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 128.75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. Considering your last offer, I would like to propose $125 as a compromise. It's slightly above your previous offer, but still within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original goal, $125 is above my minimum acceptable price and allows me to secure a sale without further negotiation."
