Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what you're willing to pay and still allows me to get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm framing the offer as beneficial to both of us, emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further discussion, making it clear I'm willing to negotiate.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a good price and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly above your valuation, and it allows me to save a substantial amount of money. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  There's still room for negotiation.  Bob's willingness to counteroffer indicates he's interested in the product and willing to pay more than his initial counteroffer.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** Selling to John would guarantee me $1,000,000, but I could potentially get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for this product.  This still represents a substantial saving for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Firm but Reasonable Price:** I'm raising the price to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for Bob, considering his valuation of $1,200,000. 
* **Highlighting the Value:**  I'm emphasizing the ""substantial saving"" for Bob to encourage him to see the value in my offer. 
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Approach:**  This phrasing suggests I'm open to compromise and willing to find a mutually agreeable solution.

This approach aims to maintain a firm stance while still showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to make a final offer closer to my desired price."
