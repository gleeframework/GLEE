"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $150. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's more than what the product is worth to you, and you have a better alternative with John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, but it's important to remember that John is your fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still too high. You're willing to pay up to $100 for the product, and you've already established a lower price point with Alice. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get closer to your target price."
