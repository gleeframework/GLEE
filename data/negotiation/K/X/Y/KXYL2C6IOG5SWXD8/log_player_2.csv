"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire [product name], a product I know you've been interested in.  While I value this product at no less than $800,000,  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This price allows you a substantial profit while ensuring a fair deal for me.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John at $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might prompt her to come back with a lower price, getting you a better deal."
