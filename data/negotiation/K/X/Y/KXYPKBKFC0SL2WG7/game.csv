"Thanks for the offer Alice! While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this price is still fair given the value proposition and would be a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate further. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $1,100,000. This price still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target of $1,000,000.  Perhaps we can split the difference and agree on $1,050,000? This price would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1,080,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your target price, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
