Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me and to Bob.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering $10,500. This is a great compromise that still gives you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,750 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price of $12,000 with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,000, which would be $9,500. Can you consider that?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is getting closer to my goal,  I still feel like I can get a better price. I'm confident I can secure a price closer to $10,000 with a few more rounds of negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting anywhere. I'm willing to meet you at $9,750, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer. If you decline, I'm going to have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 9750}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me at $9,750, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go down to $9,500, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $15,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John. This is a difficult decision because I'm very close to a deal with Bob, but  $9,500 is still below my ideal price point.  With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob.  Selling to John will guarantee me a profit and protect me from potentially losing the deal entirely."
