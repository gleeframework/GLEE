"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're confident it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its worth to you, we propose a price of $100 for the product. This offer allows us to fairly compensate for our efforts and costs while providing you with an exceptional value. We hope you find this proposal attractive and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120, you know you have a fallback option with John at $120. There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she's willing to go lower."
