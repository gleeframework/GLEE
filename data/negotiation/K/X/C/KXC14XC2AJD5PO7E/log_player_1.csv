{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. It gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a decent profit.  I'll be ready to counter if necessary but also aware that John is waiting in the wings with a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to give up on this deal just yet. I believe there is still room for negotiation. I will counteroffer to keep the negotiation going and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,350,000 to make this work. It's still a significant discount from my initial offer and a good deal for you. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit far from your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000. How about $1,275,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,275,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable range. The negotiations are getting tedious, and I'm starting to feel like Bob is being stubborn.  Since John is a sure thing for $1,500,000, I'm going to cut my losses and sell to him. There's no need to waste more time trying to squeeze every last dollar out of Bob."
