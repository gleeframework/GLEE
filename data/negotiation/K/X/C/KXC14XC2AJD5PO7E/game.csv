"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,350,000 to make this work. It's still a significant discount from my initial offer and a good deal for you. Let's find a compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit far from your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000. How about $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
