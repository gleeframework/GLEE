"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I see the value in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Could you do $725,000? That would be a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is a competitive price that still reflects the product's value and my target profit margin. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting close to my limit.  Would you consider $750,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting close to the deadline, but I'm willing to make one more move. I can meet you at $800,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,7,
