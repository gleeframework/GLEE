"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,450,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1450000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I see you're coming up with a more reasonable offer, and I appreciate that.  However, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it reflects the value I see in our potential partnership.  Let's make this happen.",1550000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",1500000.0,Bob,6,,
