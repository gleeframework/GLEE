"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know you can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, there's no reason to engage in negotiations with Alice. 

Accepting Alice's offer would result in the same price, and rejecting it to counteroffer would risk Alice walking away or ending up at a price you're not comfortable with.  

Therefore, buying from John is the most logical and risk-free option."
