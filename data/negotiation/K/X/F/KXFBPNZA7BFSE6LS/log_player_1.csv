"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

While I could continue negotiating with Bob, it's unlikely he'll meet my minimum price.  It's more profitable to sell to John at $120 than to potentially get stuck in a protracted negotiation with Bob."
