Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is significantly below its value.  I can go as low as $10,000.  This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000. It's better to secure the product from John at $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
