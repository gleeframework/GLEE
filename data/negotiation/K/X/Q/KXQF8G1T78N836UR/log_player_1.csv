Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a fantastic deal, as you know the value it holds for your business. I'm confident this is a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and the price you're willing to sell it for. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $1,100,000 with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the significant value this product brings to your business and is a good compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This price is fair, considering the value it holds for me and the price you're willing to sell it for.  Let's close this deal and avoid further back and forth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,050,000, $1,000,000 is a good deal and it's better than selling to John or continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially losing him as a buyer."
