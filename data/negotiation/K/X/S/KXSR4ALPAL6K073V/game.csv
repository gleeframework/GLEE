,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, Bob, but I really think this product is worth more than $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we split the difference again and meet at $120? That's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $130, but I need to make a profit, so I'm not going to go any lower than that. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
