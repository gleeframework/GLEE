Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I truly appreciate your continued interest in my product. To be completely transparent, $1,060,000 is still not quite enough to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $1,085,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  It's a great opportunity for both of us.
