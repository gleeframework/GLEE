Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than the product's value to Bob, but not excessively so, leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept."
