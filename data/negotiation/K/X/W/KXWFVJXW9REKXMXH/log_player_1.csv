Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  You know Bob values the product at $12,000. Setting the price at $11,500 maximizes your potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($500) from the transaction. 
* **Negotiation Room:** This offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. You can potentially go as low as $10,500 and still make more profit than selling to John.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John's offer ($10,000). This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
