Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay close to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to make a deal, I can't accept such a low price.  I will counteroffer and try to find a price that's more reasonable for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm countering with $17,000. This is still a good price for me, as it's well above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this is a more reasonable price for Bob, and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob,  his latest offer of $12,000 is still too low. At this point, it's more advantageous for me to sell to John for $15,000. This guarantees a sale at a price that is at least my minimum value."
