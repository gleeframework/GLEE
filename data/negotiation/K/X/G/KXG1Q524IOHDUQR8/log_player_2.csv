Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand you're looking for a great deal, $1000000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated fairly for this valuable product.  I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1050000.  This price represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and is still a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!
