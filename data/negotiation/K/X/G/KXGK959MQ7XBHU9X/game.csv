"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1200000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits it could bring to my business.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price,  $1200000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum value. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1750000. This price still reflects the product's unique value, and I believe it's a fair middle ground.  Let's keep the conversation going, and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1500000 for the product. I think this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
