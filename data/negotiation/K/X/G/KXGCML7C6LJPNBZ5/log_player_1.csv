"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the value of the product, $900,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which is a fair price given my evaluation of the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is a significant amount, I'm confident I can secure a better deal.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept anything significantly below my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a significant step closer to your initial offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my initial asking price, $825,000 is a good deal and a significant amount of money.  It's worth securing the sale rather than risking further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a decision to sell to John."
