Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your target, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I can meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If not, I'm willing to walk away and explore other opportunities.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $1,200,000. Accepting now avoids the risk of her walking away, which would force you to buy from John at a higher price."
