# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further.

$1,900,000 is still too high, but it's good that Alice is showing some flexibility. You can try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer.  While $1,350,000 is still under what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price, but only if you can finalize the deal within the next 24 hours. This is a limited-time offer. Let me know if you're interested.

Although $1,350,000 is more than you initially wanted, it's still within your budget and Alice is offering a limited-time deal.  It's likely you won't get a better price, so accepting is the best option."
