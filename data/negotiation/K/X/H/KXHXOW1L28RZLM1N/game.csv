"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product but can only offer $800,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000?  This is the absolute maximum I can afford at this time, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer.  While $1,350,000 is still under what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price, but only if you can finalize the deal within the next 24 hours. This is a limited-time offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
