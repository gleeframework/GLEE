"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts at a price significantly lower than Alice's offer but still provides her with a profit. It also leaves room for further negotiation.  This approach aims to find a middle ground where both parties feel like they are getting a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is lower than her previous offer and closer to my maximum budget. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and potentially going back to her original price ($1,200,000) is too high.  Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a price slightly above my preferred budget, but still within a reasonable range."
