Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $14,000."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) to maximize our profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring we get a price significantly higher than our minimum ($12,000).
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** Starting too high (e.g., $14,500) might immediately turn Bob off. This offer aims to be strong while still seeming reasonable. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $14,000. We have a strong fallback with John at $12,000, giving us leverage in the negotiation."
