"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair compromise and would make this a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
