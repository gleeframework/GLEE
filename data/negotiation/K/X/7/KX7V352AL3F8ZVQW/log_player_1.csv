Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer leaves $1000 of profit for you, which is less than what you'd get from John, but it still gives Bob a chance to buy the product at a lower price than what John is offering. This strategy maximizes your potential earnings while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the offer."
