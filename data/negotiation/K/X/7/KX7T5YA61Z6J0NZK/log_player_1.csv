{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He values it at $12,000, so this gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're comfortable selling for $15,000, so you have room to drop the price if needed.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and maintaining a good relationship with Bob in case negotiations continue."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can reach a more agreeable price.  There's still potential to get closer to my desired price, and I'm confident I can do better than Bob's initial counteroffer."

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $11,800 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not yet ready to accept an offer that's significantly lower than what I could get from John. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, perhaps closer to $13,000."
