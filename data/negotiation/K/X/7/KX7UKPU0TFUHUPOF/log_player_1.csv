"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position that allows for potential negotiation.  It also demonstrates the value I place on the product and sets a high bar for Bob to meet.  

I will be carefully watching Bob's response and adjusting my strategy based on his actions."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject** Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a good price, it's still below my initial asking price. I believe there's potential to get closer to my desired price. 

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $975,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's interest while still holding firm on my desire for a higher price. I believe this price point is within the range of what both of us could find acceptable."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject** Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $925,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to $975,000. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer. I believe this price point is a good compromise and could lead to a deal being made."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject** Bob's offer. While $920,000 is getting closer to my floor, I'm still not satisfied with the price. We're getting close to the end of the rounds, but I'm hoping to get a slightly better price with one or two more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 935000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $935,000.  This is a small concession to try and meet Bob halfway.  We're getting close to the end of the rounds, and I want to close a deal, but I still need to get a price that's reasonable for me."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only three rounds left, I'm going to **sell the product to John for $800,000.**

While I'm not thrilled about accepting the price, I've reached a point where the risk of not closing a deal outweighs the potential to get a slightly higher price from Bob. It's better to guarantee a sale than to risk getting nothing at all."
