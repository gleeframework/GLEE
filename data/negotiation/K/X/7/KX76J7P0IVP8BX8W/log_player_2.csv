# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm looking for a quick sale.  How about $19,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $19,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the product for $12,000 from John.  It's better to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

While $15,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still over what he's willing to pay. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."
