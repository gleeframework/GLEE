"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $19,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $19,000 is pretty firm.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,3,
