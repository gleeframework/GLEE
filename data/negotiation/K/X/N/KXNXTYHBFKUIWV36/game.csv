"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This still represents a good deal for you, as the product is worth much more than that.  What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $140 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $150.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it's the best I can offer.  Let's finalize this, I'm ready to sell!",150.0,Alice,5,
