{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The message invites Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open.

This approach balances maximizing potential earnings with keeping the negotiation open.  I'm confident I can get a price closer to my minimum if Bob is genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $125 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest. I can likely get a better price by counter-offering.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I have John's offer of $150 as a backup, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's low offer.

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price closer to my minimum while still keeping the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This still represents a good deal for you, as the product is worth much more than that.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $175 to $160.  
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to make the price seem more appealing.
* **Keeping Negotiation Open:**  I'm using a friendly tone and asking for Bob's opinion to keep the dialogue open. 

This counteroffer balances the need to get a better price with keeping the negotiation moving forward. I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value in my offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still a small window for negotiation, and I believe I can likely get him to go up to $150.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $150 is tempting, I'm hesitant to sell to him just yet.  If I can get Bob to $150, it's a better outcome for me.

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to close the gap and reach a mutually acceptable price."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer, as it's my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that Bob will understand the value of the product and agree to this price.
* **Strong Closing:** I use strong language like ""final offer"" and ""ready to sell"" to show that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I emphasize that this price is fair for both of us to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.

This counteroffer is my last attempt to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob. If he rejects it, I will sell the product to John for $150."
