"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down a little more, to $1,000,000. That's a significant compromise from my initial position. Let's see if we can find common ground here. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
