Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $80 is quite a bit lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. Is that something you'd consider?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $90 is still quite low for me. How about we split the difference and call it $115? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear that Bob is very reluctant to move significantly from his offer.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price that's acceptable for you. Taking the guaranteed $150 from John is the best option."
