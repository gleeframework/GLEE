"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm offering $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
