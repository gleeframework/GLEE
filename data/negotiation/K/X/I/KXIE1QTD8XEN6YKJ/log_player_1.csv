"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm confident that once you see its potential, we can find a mutually agreeable price."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the ""unique value proposition,"" we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth above his estimated $1,200,000.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Assuring Bob that you're willing to find a ""mutually agreeable price"" encourages him to engage in the negotiation process.

**Important Considerations for Future Rounds:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Pay close attention to how much lower Bob goes. This will indicate how aggressively he wants the product. 
* **Time:**  We have 10 rounds but always have the option of John's $1,500,000 offer.  As rounds progress, the value of accepting a lower offer from Bob increases due to the time pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob meeting your initial offer exactly halfway is a strong signal of his interest and a willingness to negotiate fairly.  While you could try to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk:

* **Bob Walks Away:** He might be turned off by further haggling, especially since he met you in the middle.
* **Time Pressure:** Each round that passes increases the risk of not reaching a deal and having to settle for John's offer, which is the same as Bob's current offer.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a good price for the product and avoids the potential downsides of continued negotiation."
