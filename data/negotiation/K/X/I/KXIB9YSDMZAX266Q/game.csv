"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product for a price that I believe is fair. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"While I appreciate the offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm happy to negotiate further, and I believe a price of $900,000 would be a fair compromise for both of us. This price still allows you a substantial profit, and I'm confident I can make this product a valuable asset. ",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a significant profit, while also giving you a good deal on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a good profit, Alice, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This price allows for a decent margin for you while still staying within my budget. I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This price still gives me a decent profit, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",980000.0,Alice,5,
