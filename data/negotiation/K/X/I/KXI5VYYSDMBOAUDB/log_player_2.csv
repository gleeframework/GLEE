"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your desired price point ($15,000).**  While it's a better deal than John's, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Rejection allows for a counteroffer.**  You can try to get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about $13,500?  I think that's a fair price, considering the value you place on this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget ($15,000) and closer to your desired price point.** You've already successfully negotiated the price down from $14,000.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation.** While you could try for a lower price, it's possible Alice won't budge, and you might end up paying more or going with John. 
* **Accepting minimizes risk.**  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product for a price that's good for you without the risk of further negotiation."
