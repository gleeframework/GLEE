{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $15,000.  We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about $13,500?  I think that's a fair price, considering the value you place on this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
