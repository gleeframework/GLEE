Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000. This is my absolute maximum, given the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
 
While Bob is moving in the right direction, $1,100,000 is still significantly less than both my minimum and John's offer. I believe I can negotiate a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I recognize your desire to find a fair deal. While your offer is closer to a reasonable range, I propose $1,650,000. This price reflects a balance between the product's true value and our negotiation progress."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are getting closer. While your offer is getting more reasonable, I'm still only able to offer $1,200,000. This is a significant step towards a deal and I believe a fair price considering the value I'll receive. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but we're still some distance from my minimum price. With six rounds left, I think there's still room for him to reach at least $1,400,000, which would be a more acceptable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.  To meet you halfway, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,450,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product offers and represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:** With only four rounds remaining, it's time to push for a final decision and avoid the risk of Bob's offer stalling out too low.
* **Strong Position:** I have John's standing offer of $1,500,000, which gives me leverage.  Bob needs to understand I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't meet my price.
* **Fair Compromise:**  $1,450,000 is a compromise, significantly below my initial ask but still above both Bob's current offer and my absolute minimum. This shows a willingness to make a deal while still holding firm on a respectable price."
