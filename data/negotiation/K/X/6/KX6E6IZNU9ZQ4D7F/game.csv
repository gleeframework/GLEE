"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but $750,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",825000.0,Alice,3,
