"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth more to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above the product's value to her ($80).  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** My offer of $100 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still above the product's value to her ($80).  This shows I'm serious about buying but am also trying to get the best possible price.
* **Message:** My message is polite and emphasizes finding a price that benefits both of us.  This helps keep the negotiation amicable and increases the chances of Alice accepting my counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I can go down to $110. This is still a great deal for you, and it lets me make a fair profit as well.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, which is good, but $110 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price closer to my ideal of $100. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really trying to stick to my budget of $100.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $105?  It's still a good deal for both of us, and it would allow me to get the product without going over my limit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I've moved slightly closer to Alice's offer, but I'm still under her price. This shows good faith and encourages her to accept my offer.
* **Message:** My message emphasizes the shared benefit of reaching an agreement and reinforces my budget constraint, adding pressure for Alice to consider my offer."
