Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to be more convinced of its value. My counteroffer is $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to be convinced that the product's value justifies the cost. My counteroffer is $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the unique capabilities of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my price, the increments are too small to justify continuing the negotiation. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000. It's better to take the sure profit now than risk Bob not reaching an acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
