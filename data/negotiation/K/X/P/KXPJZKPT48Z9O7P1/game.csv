"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is capped at $15,000. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this counteroffer.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however,  $12,500 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,250? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to both of us.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $12,500. Would you be willing to go down to $12,750? I'm trying to stay within my budget and think this price is a good balance between value and cost.",12750.0,Bob,4,
