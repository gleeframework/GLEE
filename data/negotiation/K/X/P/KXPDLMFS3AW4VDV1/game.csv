"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $105? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a little more than I'm willing to pay. How about $102? This is a fair price that reflects our both needs, and I'm confident that we can both be happy with this deal.",102.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $102. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $108? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a good compromise.",108.0,Alice,5,
