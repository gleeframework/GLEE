I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, while still being a decent profit over my minimum value."

$10,000 is significantly less than my minimum value. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a compromise, but it still gives me a reasonable profit."

Bob is consistently offering lower prices than my minimum.  I'm not confident I can get a better price from him, so I'll sell to John for $12,000."
