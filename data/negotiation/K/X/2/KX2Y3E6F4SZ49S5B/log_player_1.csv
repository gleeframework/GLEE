Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's well worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, $1,500,000. This allows room for negotiation and ensures I'm maximizing my potential profit.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and framing it as a unique opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000. It's not worth accepting at this point. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum value but shows flexibility.  I'm also reaffirming the product's worth to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1150000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below $1,200,000. I'm going to reject it and see if I can push for a higher price.  I have a few rounds left, and I don't want to settle for less than what the product is truly worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still not enough.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000,  which is a significant compromise on my part. This price reflects the product's value while still being fair to both of us.  Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm getting closer to my minimum value, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing my willingness to compromise to encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
