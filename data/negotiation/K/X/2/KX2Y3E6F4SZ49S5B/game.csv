"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1150000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still not enough.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1250000,  which is a significant compromise on my part. This price reflects the product's value while still being fair to both of us.  Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
