I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This leaves some room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm countering with $1,250,000.  This is still a significant profit for me, and hopefully, it's more appealing to Bob than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum value. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. I'll sell to John for $1,200,000 to ensure a guaranteed profit."
