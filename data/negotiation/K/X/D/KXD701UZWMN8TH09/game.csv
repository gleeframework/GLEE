"I'm interested in the product, but $1300000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1100000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but $1250000 is my lowest possible price. It's a fair midpoint between our initial offers, and I believe it still represents a good deal for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1150000. Can you consider this price?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  While I appreciate your offer,  $1150000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but $1200000 is my final offer. It's a fair price for the product and ensures both of us get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
