"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $150, but Alice's offer is $120.  
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:** There's room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price.
* **Avoiding John for now:**  While John is an option, it's better to try and get a lower price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  $105 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's still above her minimum value. This shows you're serious about negotiating.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  You've left space for Alice to counter, which keeps the negotiation moving. 
* **Focus on your value:** You're clearly stating your maximum price while also demonstrating that you're willing to be fair."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $115, which is a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's a compromise, $115 is still above your desired price range. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and you're still in a good position to get a lower price. 
* **Avoiding John for now:** You want to explore all options with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down. However, $115 is still a little more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but consistent movement:**  You're showing a willingness to meet halfway, but still pushing for a better price.
* **Keeping the pressure on:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and emphasizes your commitment to getting a good deal.
* **Leaving room for a deal:** You're still offering a price that's above Alice's minimum, which keeps the possibility of a deal alive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** Although it's a compromise, $112.50 is still more than you want to pay.
* **The negotiation is close:** You're within a small price range, and there's a good chance you can push Alice down to your target price.
* **Avoiding John for now:**  You're getting closer to your desired price, and it's worth trying to close the deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $112.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really hoping we can find a price we're both comfortable with. Would you consider $110?  It would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding firm:**  You're sticking to your last offer, showing Alice that you're serious about your price point.
* **Appealing to mutual benefit:** Emphasizing that $110 is a ""great deal for both of us"" tries to make the deal more appealing to Alice.
* **Creating urgency:** By suggesting it's a ""great deal,"" you're implying that the deal might not be on the table for long."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $112.50 is still a bit high for you, but I'm really close to my minimum price. I can do $111, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your range:** While $111 is slightly higher than your desired $110, it's within your maximum price range. 
* **Limited negotiation time:**  You've reached Round 7, so you're running out of opportunities to negotiate further.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject Alice's offer, there's no guarantee she'll counteroffer again.  You might end up having to buy from John at a higher price.

**Conclusion:**  It's a good deal for you, considering your maximum budget, and accepting it minimizes the risk of getting stuck with a higher price from John."
