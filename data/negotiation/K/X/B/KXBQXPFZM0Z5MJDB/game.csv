"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $115, which is a great compromise. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down. However, $115 is still a little more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's see if we can make this work.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $112.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really hoping we can find a price we're both comfortable with. Would you consider $110?  It would be a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $112.50 is still a bit high for you, but I'm really close to my minimum price. I can do $111, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",111.0,Alice,7,
