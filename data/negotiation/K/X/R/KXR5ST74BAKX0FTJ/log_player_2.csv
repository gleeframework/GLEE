Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal.  What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still not quite meeting my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, but that's my absolute lowest. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know if you're able to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  At this point, Alice has shown a resistance to going lower than $1,300,000.  While Bob might be able to negotiate further, he's getting close to his limit.  John is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is within his budget and a better deal than anything Alice has offered so far.  It's time to move on and avoid further negotiation."
