# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's a great deal for you, and it's worth at least that much to you.  Let me know if you're interested! If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is happy to pay $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product for $11,000, which is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  You can get the same product from John for $10,000, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
