Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation or for Bob to accept outright. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** If Bob accepts the $150 offer, you earn an extra $30 profit compared to selling to John.
* **Backup Option:** You're not losing anything by trying to sell at a higher price, as you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120."
