"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1250000.  This is a significant discount from what I believe its true value to be, and it reflects my confidence in your ability to maximize its potential. Let's discuss further if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
