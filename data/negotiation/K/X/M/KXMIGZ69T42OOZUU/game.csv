Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our premium product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. What do you think?,2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $2000000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in the product and I think it has a lot of potential. Would you be willing to come down to $1600000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $1600000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1800000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1700000? I truly believe this is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal efficiently.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $1700000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1750000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me. However, $1750000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1725000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1725000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go down to $1725000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $1800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,7,
