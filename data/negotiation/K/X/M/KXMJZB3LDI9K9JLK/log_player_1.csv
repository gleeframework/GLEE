Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is a significant price point. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I'm making a good profit.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the product's worth to Bob to create a sense of urgency and value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I clearly state that I'm open to negotiation, suggesting a willingness to compromise and avoid a stalemate. 
* **Plan B:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I can walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $1,200,000 and even below my initial offer of $1,100,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does indicate that he's interested. I can use this to my advantage in the next round of negotiation.
* **John is a Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I can afford to be firm in my negotiations with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired amount. I'll need to consider how far I'm willing to go down to secure a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900,000 is too far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still represents a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:** I'm coming down from my initial offer, but not drastically. This shows flexibility while maintaining a respectable profit margin.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's worth to Bob to keep the focus on its value and justify my price. 
* **Confidence:**  By stating ""I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile,"" I'm subtly suggesting that Bob should accept this offer as it's a good deal for him.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to weigh whether to lower my price further or move on to John. My goal is to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open as long as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum price of $1,200,000 and significantly lower than the product's worth to me.
* **Negotiation leverage:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, indicating he's interested in the product. I can use this to my advantage in the next round.
* **John remains a backup:**  I can still sell to John for a higher price, giving me the freedom to be firm in my negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired amount.  I'll have to consider how much more I'm willing to lower the price to secure a deal with Bob, while keeping in mind my minimum price and the potential of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still quite a bit below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, considering its value to you.  It's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product at a price that's within your budget."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows a commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasizing value again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify my price. 
* **Focus on win-win:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great opportunity"" for Bob, highlighting that he's getting a good deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as the price difference between John's offer and my minimum is negligible."
