"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I understand that it's worth $15,000 to you, but my budget is limited. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go as low as $10,000.  The product is worth a lot to me, and I'm confident it's worth the investment for you. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's still a great deal for you and allows me to get closer to my goal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
