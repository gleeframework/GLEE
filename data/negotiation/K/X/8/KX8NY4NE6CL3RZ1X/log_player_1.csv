"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Gauge the Waters:** This first offer is also designed to gauge Bob's willingness to pay. His response will give us valuable information about his negotiating strategy.
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping the $800,000 offer from John in mind provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob stall, we have a fallback plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Could you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000).  There's room to negotiate further.
* **Early Stage:** It's still early in the negotiation. Rejecting this offer signals that we're serious about obtaining a better price.
* **John as Leverage:** We can use the standing offer from John as leverage. While we haven't revealed this to Bob, it provides us with a strong negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm eager to find an agreement, $900,000 undervalues the product's true worth. Could we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects its value while acknowledging your initial offer."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** We're proposing a price that's a significant decrease from our initial offer ($1,100,000) but still well above Bob's offer and our minimum. This shows flexibility while aiming high.
* **Justification:** We're reinforcing the product's value to justify the higher price. This reminds Bob of the benefits he gains while countering his lower offer.
* **Time Consideration:** With each round, we edge closer to the deadline.  Proposing a strong counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving efficiently."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Signals, But Room to Grow:** Bob's message is positive, suggesting he's serious about purchasing. However, the price gap is still considerable, and we believe he's willing to go higher.
* **Negotiation Tactics:** Accepting at this point might leave money on the table. We need to test Bob's resolve further before settling.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** We're still well above John's $800,000 offer, giving us a safety net while pushing for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. Let's make this happen.  How about we settle at $985,000? This represents a significant concession on my end and reflects the true value of this deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 985000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  We're making a smaller concession this time ($40,000 down from $1,025,000) to signal that we're getting closer to our bottom line. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's make this happen"" injects a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to move closer to an agreement.
* **Mutually Beneficial Framing:**  We're highlighting that this price is a win-win,  reinforcing the value Bob gets while solidifying our profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer and I appreciate you working with me.  To get this done, could we settle at $970,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $970,000 is a significant profit margin above our minimum price ($800,000).
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob is negotiating in smaller increments now ($15,000). Pushing further risks a stalemate or an insignificant gain.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value. Further negotiation delays the realization of this profit.
* **Bob's Tone:** Bob's message conveys a sense of finality. He's likely reached his upper limit, and pushing further might make him walk away."
