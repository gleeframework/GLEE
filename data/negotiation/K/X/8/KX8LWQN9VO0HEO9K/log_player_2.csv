"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is exactly your maximum budget. There's no immediate benefit to accepting, as you could get the same product from John. By rejecting, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  The product seems interesting, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still very interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a good deal for me. This is significantly lower than John's price, and I'm likely to get a better deal than if I continue negotiating. It's worth accepting to avoid further haggling."
