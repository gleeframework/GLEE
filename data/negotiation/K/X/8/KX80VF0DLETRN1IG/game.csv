"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $12000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $11000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle on $10500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. ",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to meet you at $10500 just yet. I'm willing to go slightly higher than my previous offer, to $11500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
