"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me. While I'm interested, $120 is a bit outside my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, so how about we meet at $102? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
