"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. Her initial offer is above your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($80) than Alice's asking price ($120). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** My message is polite and explains that while I'm interested, the initial price is outside my budget. I provide a clear counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving.
* **Goal in Mind:** My goal is to get the product for as close to $100 as possible, but I also know I have the backup option of buying from John. This knowledge gives me some leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is meeting me halfway, but the new price is still above my budget and my ideal price from John. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit further before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Alice's price, showing that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still aiming for a price below $100.
* **Direct and Clear:** My message is straightforward, suggesting a specific price and highlighting it as a fair compromise.
* **Time Consideration:** While I could continue negotiating in smaller increments, I'm conscious of not dragging the negotiation on for too long.  There's a balance between getting the best price and potentially losing the deal to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your latest offer, but I still think the product is worth more than $95. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a fair price considering the product's quality and value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $105, and while that's close to John's price, I know I can get the product for $100 from John without further negotiation.  It's not worth the risk of continuing with Alice and potentially ending up with a price higher than John's."
