{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've been interested in. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $175, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob but lower than my minimum selling price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open-ended, inviting Bob to respond and potentially start a conversation. 

**Strategy:**

* By starting with a higher price, I aim to maximize my potential profit.
* This strategy allows for negotiation and a potential middle ground to be found. 
*  If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum selling price of $150 and even lower than what the product is worth to him ($100).  It's not worth accepting such a low offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to see if there's a possible middle ground without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm counteroffering at $125, which is still above my minimum price but significantly lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also protecting my value.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and open-ended to encourage further discussion.

**Strategy:**

* By counteroffering at $125, I'm hoping to find a middle ground.  
* I'm staying firm on my minimum price of $150 but showing flexibility to reach an agreement. 
* If Bob still refuses, I'm prepared to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $95? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $95 is still well below my minimum selling price of $150.  While it's closer to what the product is worth to him, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $150.

**Reasoning:**

* **Financial Gain:** Selling to John ensures a higher profit for me compared to accepting Bob's offer.
* **Time Efficiency:** Further negotiation with Bob might take more time and effort without a guarantee of a better offer.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John offers a certain sale and avoids the risk of Bob continuing to haggle. 

**Conclusion:**

Given the circumstances, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John and secure the higher price."
