"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. I understand its worth to you is significantly higher than my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a substantial discount from its true value to you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
