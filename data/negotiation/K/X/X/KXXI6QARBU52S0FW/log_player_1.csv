"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. It's priced at $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is interested and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $115? It's a fair compromise that leaves us both with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $105? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for that price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $110 as a final offer.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but I'm really close to my budget. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll take the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not willing to go any lower than $110.  Bob is stubbornly sticking to his $105 offer, and I'm concerned that we're getting too close to the end of the negotiation.  Rather than risk getting a lower offer or ending up with no deal at all, I'm choosing to sell to John for $150.  This ensures I meet my minimum price and avoid further negotiation."
