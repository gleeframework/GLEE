"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price is more reasonable for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,250. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value.  If you're still interested, let's close this deal.  I'm confident you won't regret it.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is the maximum I'm willing to spend, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
