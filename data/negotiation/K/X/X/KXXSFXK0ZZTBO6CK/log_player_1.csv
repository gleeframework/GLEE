Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but higher than your minimum threshold. It also leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  I'm proposing $1,050,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
