"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is quite high, leaving little room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer and providing a counteroffer significantly below $950,000 allows for exploration of a better deal. Remember, you can always buy from John for $1,000,000, providing a price ceiling for your negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, aiming to gauge her flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** While a low starting point, $700,000 still offers Alice a considerable profit over her perceived value of $800,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves ample room for further negotiation and compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves room for a profitable deal for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved down a bit, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, the price is still closer to your maximum budget than it is to her initial offer. Rejecting and countering again keeps the negotiation moving and gives you a chance to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $775,000?"",
""product_price"": 775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer aims to find a compromise between your previous offer of $700,000 and Alice's counteroffer of $850,000. 
* **Demonstrating Flexibility:** By moving closer to Alice's asking price, you signal a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Maintaining a Reasonable Position:**  $775,000 remains a substantial saving from Alice's initial offer and John's alternative price."
