"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's value to her ($8,000). This indicates there's room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer isn't too low that it's likely to be immediately rejected, allowing for potential bargaining.
* **Clear Communication:** The message clearly states Bob's counteroffer and shows he's engaged in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That way we both get a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair Compromise:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer. $11,000 is a reasonable compromise, especially considering Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* **Avoiding John's Price:** Buying from John would cost significantly more, so accepting Alice's offer is a better financial decision.
* **Potential for Future Negotiation:** While accepting this offer, Bob still has the option to negotiate for a better price on future purchases from Alice."
