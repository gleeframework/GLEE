Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but is still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of the product. This gives me room to negotiate if he counters, while still leaving me a good profit.  I'm also leaving the door open for a potential counteroffer to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a good amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That way we both get a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}
