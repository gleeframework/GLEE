Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the considerable value it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $900,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.  Would you consider $750,000? That's a significant investment on my part and reflects a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $750,000 is a tempting offer, we are still early in the negotiation. Bob clearly sees significant value in the product, and we have room to push for a higher price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This feels like a fair compromise considering the potential return on investment this product offers you."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, there's still a gap between our positions. My best and final offer is $800,000. This is a very serious offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now matched John's offer. While we might be able to push for slightly more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting the $800,000 offer guarantees a good sale price without the uncertainty of further negotiation."
