Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.

Alice's offer is quite high.  It's much closer to my maximum budget than it is to her perceived value. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the considerable value it will bring you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
