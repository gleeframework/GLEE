"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I can realistically accept. Let's meet in the middle. How about $100? It's still a fair deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $60 is low, Alice. How about $75? That's a pretty good price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again? Let's try $110. This way we both get a good deal, and I can ensure you get a quality product.",110.0,Alice,5,
