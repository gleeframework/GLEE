{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so $130 is a significant price increase but still within a range that might be acceptable.
* **It's below your minimum value:** You won't sell for less than $150, so you have room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **It's a clear opening statement:** This sets the stage for further discussion and allows Bob to respond with a counteroffer or acceptance.

I'll be ready to respond to Bob's next move, whether it's a counteroffer or a rejection. I'll also be keeping John's $150 offer in mind as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low.  It's well below my minimum value of $150, and even significantly less than his own stated value of $80.  I'm not willing to sell at such a drastic loss.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'll make sure it's a price closer to my minimum value and a more fair reflection of the product's worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I can realistically accept. Let's meet in the middle. How about $100? It's still a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Reiterate my minimum value:** $100 is still well above my minimum of $150, demonstrating my commitment to a fair price.
* **Show flexibility:** While I'm not accepting his $60, I'm willing to compromise.
* **Frame it as a win-win:**  $100 is a better deal than John's $150 offer and still below his $80 perceived value.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'll be prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $60 is low, Alice. How about $75? That's a pretty good price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is a slight improvement over Bob's previous offer, it's still far below my minimum value of $150. I'm not willing to sell at such a substantial loss. I'll proceed to the next round and make another counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum value while remaining open to further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again? Let's try $110. This way we both get a good deal, and I can ensure you get a quality product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm sticking to my goal of getting closer to my minimum value while also being flexible and open to negotiations. $110 represents a compromise: it's higher than Bob's latest offer but lower than my previous counteroffer. I believe this will encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously."
