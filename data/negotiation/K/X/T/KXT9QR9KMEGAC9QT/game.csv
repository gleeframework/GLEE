"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. It's a fair price considering we're both getting closer to a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
