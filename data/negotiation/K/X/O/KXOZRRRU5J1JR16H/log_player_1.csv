Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,700,000. This is higher than the value to Bob but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives us room to negotiate and leaves me some wiggle room to potentially accept a counteroffer if it's close enough to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still below it. I'm going to reject this offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm offering a price of $1,600,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident that further negotiation will get me closer to my target.  John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm going to sell to John."
