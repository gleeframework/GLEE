"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In order to find a mutually beneficial solution, I propose adjusting the price slightly higher than your offer. I suggest considering $1100000 as a fair price for the product. This proposal allows for a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive in the market.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see your point about a fair profit margin, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1050000.  This would allow me to purchase the product within my budget while providing you with a reasonable return on your investment. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
