Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold opening move that allows for negotiation. It's important to remember that my minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000, but I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'll use the remaining rounds to adjust my price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob right away. There's still room for negotiation and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}

I'm countering with $1,800,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a decent profit for me. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a reasonable price and accepts."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left and can try to get a bit closer to my desired price. There's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle too early."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,700,000.  I'm getting closer to Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. However, I still want to see if I can get a little more."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're getting close to my minimum price, and it seems like we're both willing to compromise. I don't want to risk losing the sale by being too stubborn. I'm happy to accept $1,650,000 and move on."
