"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $130 is above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob's counteroffer is $25 below Alice's initial price, reflecting a significant discount.
* **Reasonable Offer:** While still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price of $100, $105 is a more reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly but firm, expressing a willingness to compromise while establishing Bob's budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  While Alice has come down from her initial price, $115 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, suggesting there's still room to reach a price that works for both parties. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Bob is reluctant to buy from John at this point because there's a chance Alice might eventually come down to a price Bob can afford.  However,  Bob is getting closer to his limit of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $115 is closer, I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm happy to pay $110, but I'm really at my limit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small step:** Bob is only offering $5 less than Alice's counteroffer, showing he is serious about a deal but trying to get the best price possible.
* **Limit reached:**  The message clarifies that $110 is the most Bob can afford, adding pressure to Alice.
* **Maintaining goodwill:** The message remains polite and focused on finding a solution, keeping the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is your limit, Bob. I'm willing to give you a bit more wiggle room. I'm now offering the product to you for $112.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** While Alice's offer is getting closer, $112.50 is still over Bob's $100 limit. 
* **Negotiation window closing:** Bob is getting closer to his limit. There are only 5 rounds left, and it's becoming risky to keep rejecting. 
* **John's offer:**  John's offer of $100 remains a viable option, especially as Alice might not budge much further. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:** The next round will be crucial for Bob to make a counteroffer that either pushes Alice to accept or forces a decision to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. While I appreciate your offer, $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. This is really my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  Bob is sticking to his $110 limit, but he's also signaling that he's ready to close the deal.
* **Closing the gap:**  The counteroffer is only $2.50 lower than Alice's offer, showing a genuine desire to find common ground.
* **Finality:** The message emphasizes that this is Bob's absolute limit, adding pressure to Alice.
* **Time is running out:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob is getting closer to John's offer and needs to push for a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'm going to throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $110, plus a special discount of 5%. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Within budget:** The offer of $110 is within Bob's budget limit. 
* **Sweetener:**  The additional 5% discount, while small, makes the offer more attractive than John's flat price. 
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 3 rounds remaining, it's becoming riskier to keep rejecting. 
* **Possible future discounts:**  Even if Bob buys from Alice now, there's a chance she might offer him a similar discount in the future. 

By accepting the offer, Bob achieves his goal of buying the product at a price he can afford while also getting a slight bonus discount."
