"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, you can likely get a better price. There are 10 rounds, and you're aiming to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer and counter-offering gives you the chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good initial negotiation point.  A $100,000 reduction from Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I'm still within the range of what the product is worth to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to move a bit, but her offer is still too high.  There are still many rounds left, so rejecting and continuing to negotiate is the best strategy to try and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating but still want a price lower than her current offer. I'm aiming for a gradual approach, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still unwilling to come down to a price I'm comfortable with. It's early in the negotiation, and I have several rounds left to push for a lower price. I'll continue to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice I'm willing to meet halfway.  This should hopefully get us closer to a deal while still staying within my budget.  I'm hoping that with a few more rounds, we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with it. We have a few more rounds, and I'm confident I can get her down further.  I'm not willing to settle for anything too close to her initial price, and I'm still aiming for a significant saving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm now offering Alice's initial price from Round 1. This signals that I'm willing to meet her halfway, and hopefully encourage her to accept.  We are in the latter stages of the negotiation, and this is a reasonable compromise. If she rejects, I'll consider the option of buying from John as we're approaching the end of the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,115,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,115,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are in the final rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Alice is not willing to budge much further.  While I can continue negotiating, the risk of not closing a deal and having to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  With only one round left, it's more advantageous to secure the product now and avoid the uncertainty of the final round."
