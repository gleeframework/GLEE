It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. You can likely get a better price than $110, especially since you have the option of buying from John for $80."

I will reject Alice's offer again.  It's still better to try to negotiate further, as I know I can get the product for $80 from John."

I'm going to offer $95. This is a reasonable compromise, and hopefully Alice will accept it. I still have the option to go with John, but I want to see if I can get a slightly better price from Alice."
