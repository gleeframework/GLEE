Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're really close, Bob! I can see you're making a strong effort to reach a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer you $10,250. That's my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it!

Alice has signaled this is her final offer and we are getting close to the halfway point between our starting positions.  While we might be able to get the price lower, it's getting risky and we risk losing the deal entirely. This is a reasonable compromise."
