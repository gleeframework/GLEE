"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $11,000 is still a stretch. Could you do $9,500? I think that's a fair price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your budget, Bob. I can do $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you!",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I can see the value, but I have a strict budget. How about we split the difference and do $10,000 even? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close, Bob! I can see you're making a strong effort to reach a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer you $10,250. That's my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it!",10250.0,Alice,7,
