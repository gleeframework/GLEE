Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is also below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is my final counteroffer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go below $14,000, but I can see that we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is my last concession before I have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  

While Alice is coming down, she's still significantly above your maximum price. You have a guaranteed option with John at $12,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice and potentially missing out on the product entirely."
