"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value, but $18,000 is too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is also below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is my final counteroffer.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $14,000 is still a stretch for me.  Could you do $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go below $14,000, but I can see that we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is my last concession before I have to consider other options.",13500.0,Alice,5,
