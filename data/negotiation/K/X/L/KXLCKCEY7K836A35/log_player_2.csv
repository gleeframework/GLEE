"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $150 from John.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum price point of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $130, which is still above Alice's minimum price of $120 but lower than her initial offer of $140. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it shows I'm willing to compromise but also trying to get the best deal possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $142 is higher than my initial offer of $130, and it's also higher than my maximum price point of $150. At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. I can get the product for $150 from John, which is a better deal than what Alice is offering."
