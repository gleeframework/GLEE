"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $850,000? That's still a significant profit for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
