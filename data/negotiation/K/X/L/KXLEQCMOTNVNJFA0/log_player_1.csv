Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You have John as a backup buyer at $100, so there's no need to undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I can only go up to $85 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is below both your minimum acceptable price ($100) and your initial offer. While it's closer to his perceived value, there's still room for negotiation. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $100, so there's no need to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $85 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $102.5? It's a great deal for a product like this."",
""product_price"": 102.5
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Approximately):** This counteroffer signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price above your minimum.  
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reinforces the product's worth to nudge Bob towards a higher price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** You're now closer to your fallback option ($100 from John), giving you leverage in further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $102.5 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference at $93.75? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to your minimum price, his offer of $93.75 is still less than what John is offering ($100). There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will get you a better price. Accepting John's offer ensures you receive your minimum acceptable price without further risk or time spent negotiating."
