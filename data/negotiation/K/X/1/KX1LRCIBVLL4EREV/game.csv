"I appreciate your product, Alice, and I'm interested in making a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value and the market conditions.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  It's significantly below what I need to consider selling. I'm willing to meet you halfway though. How about $750,000? This price still gives you a good deal while allowing me to get closer to my asking price.  What do you say?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of what I'm comfortable paying. How about $725,000? I think this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference again? $737,500 would be a fair price that gives us both some room to maneuver.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",737500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there. How about $730,000? I think this price is a fair compromise that gets us closer to the middle ground.",730000.0,Bob,6,
