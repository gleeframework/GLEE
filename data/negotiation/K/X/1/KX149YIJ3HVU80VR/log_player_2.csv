"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's more than your maximum budget and more importantly, you have a better alternative. You know John will sell you the product for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can secure a better deal with John."
