Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be a great value at $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product might be even more valuable.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering it at $120, we can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, great! If he counters, we know he's interested but wants to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

This strategy maximizes the potential to get a price higher than our minimum while still ensuring a sale."
