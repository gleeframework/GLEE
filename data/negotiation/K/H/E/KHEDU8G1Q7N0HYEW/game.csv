"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's closer to your value than my offer.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This still gives you a good price and allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's work this out.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10750 for the product, which is a fair compromise. It's closer to my budget and still a decent profit for you.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing your efforts to reach a fair price, but $10750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11250. This is a fair compromise and a great opportunity for you. Let's close the deal!",11250.0,Alice,5,
