"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer it to you for $10,200. It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your budget constraints.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,200 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,500. It's a slight compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",9500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further.  $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  However, I'm willing to go up to $9,200, which is my absolute limit. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize this deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",9200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,800. I believe the product's value warrants a premium price, and I'm willing to compromise, but not to the point where I'm giving it away. I can offer it to you for $9,800. It's the best I can do.",9800.0,Alice,9,
