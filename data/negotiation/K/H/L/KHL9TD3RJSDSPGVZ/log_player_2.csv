{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer, but still within a range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. My goal is to find a price we both can agree on within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $11,000 is still above my budget. I will continue to negotiate with Alice, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product. However, I'm still keeping it within my budget and hoping she'll consider this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer it to you for $10,200. It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your budget constraints.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, $10,200 is still outside my budget. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Alice. There's a good chance she'll lower her price further, and I'm not in a rush to make a deal yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,200 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my previous offer. Alice has lowered her price, so I'm hoping this will show her I'm serious and willing to compromise. If she rejects again, I'll consider buying from John, but I'm still hoping we can reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,500. It's a slight compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further.  $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  However, I'm willing to go up to $9,200, which is my absolute limit. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize this deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly but still staying within my budget. This shows Alice I'm serious about making a deal, but also sets a clear boundary.  With only a few rounds left, I'm pushing for a final agreement."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,800.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $9,800 is still above my budget. With only one round left, I don't have enough time to negotiate further. It's better to accept John's offer of $8,000, which is within my budget and guarantees I get the product."
