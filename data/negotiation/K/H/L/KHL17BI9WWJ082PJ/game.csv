"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good price.  While $12000 is my absolute minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $15000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and shows my willingness to work with you.  What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. Can you meet me at this price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While $12500 is tempting, I'm really hoping for a little more to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $13750? This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think!",13750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12000, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Can you seriously consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,6,
