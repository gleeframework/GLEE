"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get a bit closer to my initial offer before settling.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good price.  While $12,000 is my absolute minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $15,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer than Bob's in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While $12,500 is tempting, I'm really hoping for a little more to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750? This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12000, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Can you seriously consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I would like to make a bit more, Bob is adamant about his $12,000 offer and I've reached my limit on negotiating.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John for $12,000."
