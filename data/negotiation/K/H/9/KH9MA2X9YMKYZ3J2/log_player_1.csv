Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to my $1,500,000 goal as possible, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to come up significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's closer to my goal, I'm still losing a significant amount of money compared to what I'm willing to accept.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but I'm still aiming for a price that's more advantageous to me. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still leaving room for a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  At this point, it's clear he's not going to come up to my price.  Selling to John is the best option to ensure I get my desired value for the product."
