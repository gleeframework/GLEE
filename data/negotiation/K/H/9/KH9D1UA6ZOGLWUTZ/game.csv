,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the offer, $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $130.  Would you be willing to consider that?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $130 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $155. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we settle on $140?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $150. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer you a small discount and sell the product to you for $147. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",147.0,Alice,5,
