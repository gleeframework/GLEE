I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential negotiation range. I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I hope this shows a willingness to negotiate while still being profitable for me."

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John. I'm happy to close the deal at this point."
