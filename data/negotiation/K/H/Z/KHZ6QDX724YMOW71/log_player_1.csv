Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe you'll find immense value in.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  Simply stating a high price isn't enough. Highlighting the ""unique features and benefits"" adds perceived value to the product, making the price seem more justifiable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone of the message is important.  By saying ""I'm proposing a price"" and asking ""What do you think?"", you signal that you're open to discussing the price and potentially negotiating.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a negotiation strategy in mind. 
* Be confident in the value of your product. This will help you justify your asking price throughout the negotiation. 
* Remember, you always have John as a backup buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
