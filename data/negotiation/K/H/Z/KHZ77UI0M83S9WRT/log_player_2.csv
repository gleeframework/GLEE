"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and a significant savings from what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 just isn't viable for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but  I need to get at least $1,000,000 for this.  It's still a significant savings for you, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,000,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which represents a substantial saving for you and a fair price for me.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but I'm still unable to accept $900,000.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This represents a significant savings for you, and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. Let's work together to finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is still above your budget, it's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and is much closer to your desired price.  It's a reasonable compromise that allows you to acquire the product while still saving some money. If you reject this offer and go to John, you'll get the product for less, but you could risk losing it to another buyer. It's a risk/reward decision. In this scenario, accepting the offer seems like the best strategy."
