"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $85 for it.  Let me know if you're interested in that.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $75? It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward. What do you think?",75.0,Alice,5,
