"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $1,200,000. Let's try $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $900,000.  It's a fair price, and it allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let's try to close this.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. Let's try $1,020,000. It's a bit above your initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",1020000.0,Alice,5,
