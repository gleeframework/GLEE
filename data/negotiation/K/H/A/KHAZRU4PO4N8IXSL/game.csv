,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited.  Let's meet in the middle at $110.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet at $115? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a decent profit on this sale.",115.0,Alice,5,
