"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering your potential profit and the value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves you with a significant profit, and allows me to make a reasonable return on my investment. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This would allow both of us to walk away with a reasonable outcome. Let's meet in the middle this time.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me, considering the value this product brings to your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's try to close the deal this round.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
