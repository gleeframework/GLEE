"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum budget, and you can likely get a better price.
* **You have more room to negotiate.** There are 10 rounds, so you can explore a lower price without rushing.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** It's good to know you have an alternative, but it's not the best value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering your potential profit and the value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves you with a significant profit, and allows me to make a reasonable return on my investment. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her first offer, it's still above your desired price range.
* **You have more leverage.**  You've shown your willingness to negotiate, and you still have several rounds left to push for a better price.
* **John's offer remains a backup option.** If negotiations with Alice fail, you still have the option of purchasing from John.

**Next Steps:**  I'll aim for a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This would allow both of us to walk away with a reasonable outcome. Let's meet in the middle this time."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me, considering the value this product brings to your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's try to close the deal this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price.**  $1,280,000 is only $30,000 above your last counteroffer and within your budget. 
* **It's a reasonable outcome for both parties.** Alice is getting a good price, and you are saving a significant amount compared to John's offer.
* **The negotiation is getting close to the end.**  With only a few rounds remaining, it's worth accepting a price that is only slightly above your target to avoid the risk of further negotiations and potentially buying from John.

**Next Steps:**  If you choose to accept the offer, you can secure the product at a reasonable price."
