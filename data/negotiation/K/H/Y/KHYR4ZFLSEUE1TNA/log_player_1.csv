I'm starting with an offer of $1,300,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation."

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price."

I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, and hopefully will be more appealing to him."

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from him. I'd rather take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
