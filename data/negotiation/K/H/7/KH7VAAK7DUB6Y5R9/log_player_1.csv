{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're starting at $13,000, which is $1,000 more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's within Bob's range:**  You know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, so this offer is within his potential buying range.
* **It allows for negotiation:**  By starting a bit higher, you leave room for negotiation and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's reaction. If he rejects, you can consider lowering the price slightly or using a different negotiation strategy. However, always keep your minimum price in mind and don't be afraid to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's good that he's showing interest, accepting his offer would leave you with a considerable loss.  It's best to reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,200 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's a reasonable compromise, and accepting it would allow you to make a good profit while still securing a sale. While you could continue negotiating, it's unlikely that Bob will go much higher, and risking further negotiation could lead to him walking away entirely."
