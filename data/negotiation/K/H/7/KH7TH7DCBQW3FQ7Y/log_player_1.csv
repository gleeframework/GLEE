"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly above my minimum ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price allows Bob to make a counteroffer without me immediately feeling like I need to accept.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and optimistic message might encourage Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can negotiate a better price. How about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Higher Price:** Bob's counteroffer is still within a range where I can potentially earn more. I'm not desperate to sell immediately, so I'll see if I can push for a better price.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Rejecting allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my ideal price. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John for $8,000 would be the absolute minimum, but I'd prefer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. How about $9,500? I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's in the middle between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:** The price is still above my minimum, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** Emphasizing the value of the product can make Bob more inclined to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose $9,200 as a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer is only $300 away from my previous counteroffer of $9,500.  
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're already in Round 4, so I'm getting closer to the point where I might have to sell to John.
* **Slight Loss but Better Than Selling to John:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, accepting this offer will net me a profit of $1,200, which is better than the $8,000 I'd get from John."
