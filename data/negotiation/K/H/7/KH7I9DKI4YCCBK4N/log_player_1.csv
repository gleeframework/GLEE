"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a reasonable starting point, leaving some room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering $100 to Bob. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round. I'm confident that I can either get a better deal with Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering $95.  This is my final offer, and it's still a reasonable compromise.  I'm willing to go slightly below my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not going any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my price, and the negotiations are getting close to the end. I'm choosing to sell to John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price and a much better deal than Bob is offering."
