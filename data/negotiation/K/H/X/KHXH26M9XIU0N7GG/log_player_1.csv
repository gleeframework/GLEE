Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95.  It's in great condition and a great value for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I think I can pay $88 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a bit more from Bob.  $88 is better than selling to John, but I think I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my asking price. How about $92?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Would $89 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd like to keep pushing for more, I think Bob is showing his top range and $89 is a decent deal.  I don't want to risk losing him entirely and having to sell to John for less."
