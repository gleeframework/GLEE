"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make a competitive offer of $950,000. This represents a 5% discount from its perceived value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly aware you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000 and is trying to anchor her offer close to that. While $950,000 is a seemingly small discount, you know you have a backup option with John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price or proceed with John if necessary, potentially saving $50,000 or more."
