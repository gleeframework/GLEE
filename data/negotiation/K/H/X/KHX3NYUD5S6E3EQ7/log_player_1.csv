Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider reducing the price?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This offer stands as a sign of my willingness to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I'm still unable to go above $10,000 for this product. Would you be willing to lower your price further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge beyond $10,000.  It's more profitable to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
