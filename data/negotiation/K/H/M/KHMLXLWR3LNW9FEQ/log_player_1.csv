"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good deal.  I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation.  I'll see if he bites, but I'm ready to make counteroffers if needed.  I also have the safety net of John's $10,000 offer if things go south."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is still lower than what I'm hoping for, and I think I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price to $13,000.  This is a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price, given the value Bob places on the product. I'm hoping he'll see this as a good deal and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $12,500 is a good price, and I'm getting closer to my desired outcome.  I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and I'm not sure if I can push for much more.  It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk losing Bob completely and having to settle for John's offer."
