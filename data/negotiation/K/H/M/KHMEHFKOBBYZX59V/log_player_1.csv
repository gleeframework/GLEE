Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $9,500."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer. It's significantly less than my minimum but still leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a somewhat good deal.
* **First Refusal:**  Offering it to Bob first at this price increases the likelihood of a sale before he knows there's a guaranteed backup offer."
