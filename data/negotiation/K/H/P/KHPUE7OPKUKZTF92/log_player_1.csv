Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal to someone who recognizes its value. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing above my minimum. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  A strong initial offer helps me understand how serious Bob is about the product. 

This strategy balances risk and reward. While Bob might reject a high offer, it positions me for the best possible outcome."
