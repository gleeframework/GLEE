"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming for a price of $8,000 or less.
* **You have room to negotiate.**  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better price.
* **Buying from John is always an option.** You can always switch to John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, showing you're serious about negotiating and making a clear starting point.
* **Reasonable offer:** $9,000 is still higher than your target of $8,000, giving Alice some room to compromise while still being within your budget.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and shows interest in the product, while also being firm about your desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to your target, you're still $2,500 above your ideal price.
* **You have more room to negotiate.** You have 7 rounds remaining, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, so there's potential for a better deal.
* **Buying from John is still a safe backup.** If negotiations fall through, you can always buy from John for your target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  This counteroffer is only $500 higher than your previous offer, showing a genuine effort to meet Alice halfway.

* **Positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and encourages Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it. It's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her previous offers, it's still $2,000 above your target price.
* **You still have leverage.** You have 5 rounds remaining and Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise. There's a good chance you can get closer to your target.
* **Buying from John is still a viable option.** If you can't get a better price from Alice, you can always buy from John for your desired price.

**Counteroffer Strategy:**

In the next round, you can try a counteroffer of $9,750. This shows you're willing to compromise further, but still aiming for a price closer to your target."
