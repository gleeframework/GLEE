Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my original offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept given the time constraint, $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it. It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down again.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,750.  This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I've already gone down significantly and am getting concerned that I won't be able to reach my minimum acceptable price within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
