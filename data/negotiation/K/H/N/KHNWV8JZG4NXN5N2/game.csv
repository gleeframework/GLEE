"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Considering its value to me, I'm willing to offer $8,500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm going to counter with $10,500. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $9,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm going to counter with $10,000. It's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $9,500.  This represents a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given our both our needs.  Let's finalize this deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
