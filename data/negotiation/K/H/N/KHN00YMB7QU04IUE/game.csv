"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? I'm willing to pay that amount for the product.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $110 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $120 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at this price?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. Would you be willing to consider a price of $115? I'm willing to pay that amount for the product.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $115 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell it to you for $117.50.  This is my final offer.  If you don't accept, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",117.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to split the difference, but $117.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $112 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",112.0,Bob,6,
