"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however, $650,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I could consider $975,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $975,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  Could you meet me in the middle at $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but $800,000 is  below the minimum I can accept. I'm willing to make one final concession at $900,000. This is my best and final offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $900,000. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $800,000, which meets your maximum budget. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the best price."
