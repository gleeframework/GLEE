"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $155. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $155 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you consider that?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $140 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $150, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",150.0,Alice,5,

"I really like the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $145. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Can you accept that?",145.0,Bob,6,
