Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling around $13,000-$13,500.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down, the price will still be significantly higher than John's offer of $12,000.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $14,500 or higher might make Bob feel like he's not getting a fair deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright."
