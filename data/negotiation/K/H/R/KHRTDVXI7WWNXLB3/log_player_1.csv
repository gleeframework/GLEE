Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While I'd like to make a quick sale, Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price. I'll counteroffer to try and secure a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives you room to negotiate. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That last price is very tempting.  How about we split the difference and close the deal at $1,525,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000

Bob's offer of $1,525,000 is just above my minimum desired price of $1,500,000, and I've already made several concessions.  Accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and a profit."
