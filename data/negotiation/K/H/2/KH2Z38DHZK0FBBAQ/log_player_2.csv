(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if you can get a lower price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget.  At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product from John for your maximum price rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice and risk her rejecting your counteroffer or making a new counteroffer that is still too high."
