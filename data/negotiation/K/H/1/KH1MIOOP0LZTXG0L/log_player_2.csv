"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on your needs and preferences. Given its high value to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its worth and your interest. Considering its market value and the benefits it offers, I suggest we start our negotiation at $120. This allows us to explore a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think, and we can proceed from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $120 is significantly more than your maximum budget of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Alice's message suggests she's open to negotiation. By rejecting this initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a lower price.
* **John's offer as a backup:**  You have the security of buying from John at $150 if negotiations with Alice fail. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting this offer, you aim to encourage Alice to propose a lower price, closer to your desired range."
