"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's not a good deal for Bob. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product has tremendous value, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it reflects the true worth of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her original price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm not comfortable going beyond $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the potential benefits for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're making progress, but $1,200,000 is still quite a gap from where I see the value. Let's try to find a compromise - how about $1,600,000? This feels like a fair deal considering the potential returns we've discussed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous ones, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's a chance Bob could negotiate a lower price, but given the time and effort spent, it's becoming increasingly likely that a deal won't be reached. 

At this point, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $1,000,000. This guarantees him the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
