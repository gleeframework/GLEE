"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm sure it's a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product has tremendous value, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it reflects the true worth of this product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm not comfortable going beyond $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the potential benefits for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're making progress, but $1,200,000 is still quite a gap from where I see the value. Let's try to find a compromise - how about $1,600,000? This feels like a fair deal considering the potential returns we've discussed.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
