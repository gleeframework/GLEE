Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $60?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to go up slightly, but $80 is the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is the best time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **You're exceeding Bob's valuation:** Bob has already stated his maximum price is $80. It's unlikely he'll go higher.
* **You're maximizing profit within reason:** While you could hold out for $100 with John,  getting $80 from Bob is a solid profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
