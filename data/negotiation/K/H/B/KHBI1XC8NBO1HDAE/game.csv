"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more than my initial asking price.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,800,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows us both to make a good deal. ",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However,  $1,400,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential for your business. I'm confident that it can generate much more value for you in the long run. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,700,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant investment for me and demonstrates my interest in acquiring the product. Let's find a way to make this work.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
