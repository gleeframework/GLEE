"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? I think that's a fair price.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit on the price, but $60 just doesn't work for me.  I understand your budget, but the product is worth a lot more.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's still a good deal for you, and it lets me make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's a good product, Alice, but $100 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $75? That's a significant increase from my last offer and puts us closer to a deal.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still too low for me. It's clear we're both trying to find a fair price, so how about we compromise at $90?  That's a good middle ground, and it gives us both something to work with. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
