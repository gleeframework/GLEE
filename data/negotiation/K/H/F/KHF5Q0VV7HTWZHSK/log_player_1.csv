Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120.  This is the price I would get from John, so I'm not losing anything by offering it to Bob first.  Since the product is only worth $80 to Bob, he'll likely reject the offer, but that's fine. I'll still be able to sell it to John for my minimum desired price."
