Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a better deal if he counter-offers.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth. 
* **Alternative:** By mentioning a public listing, Alice implies there's competition, even though John's offer is the same â€“ this could encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Politeness:**  A polite and open tone encourages a positive response and further negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still being realistic about Bob potentially rejecting the offer."
