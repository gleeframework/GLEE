Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, allowing room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that I value the product and am confident in its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is still a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm confident that Bob is genuinely interested in the product, and I'm willing to see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I'm hoping to demonstrate flexibility while still maintaining a profitable price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has come down to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not sure there's any more room for negotiation. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm going to take the sure thing and sell the product to him for $1,000,000. It's a solid deal, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on that security for the potential of a small increase."
