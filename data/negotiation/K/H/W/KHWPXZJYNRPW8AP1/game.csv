"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to show my commitment to a successful deal. This price still reflects the unique value of this product and gives you a significant benefit. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see a more significant reduction. How about $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer, but $775,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which reflects the unique value of this product and still allows for a good profit for you. This is my final offer before I consider other options. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
