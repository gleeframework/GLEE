Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it at $80, I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without losing him to a rejection.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $120 is a strong starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's valuation, making it attractive, while still securing a $40 profit for Alice. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John provides a safety net ($80), but we aim to get a better deal with Bob first."
