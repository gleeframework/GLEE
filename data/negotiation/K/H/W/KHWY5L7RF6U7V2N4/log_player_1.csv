"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm not willing to accept that. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While $75 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to go below $80. I'll counteroffer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
