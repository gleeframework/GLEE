"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the product's performance.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's true value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
