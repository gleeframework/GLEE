"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. Let's start with a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is high-quality, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we start the negotiations at $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the quality it offers. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $13,500 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we possibly settle on $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're making progress, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $11,500. I'm willing to meet you at $12,800, which is a compromise that's closer to my target price. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the quality it offers. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the counter-offer.  To be completely honest, I'm finding a similar product elsewhere for $12,000. If you're able to come down to that price, I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you've found a similar product elsewhere, but I'm confident that this product has unique features that set it apart. I'm willing to meet you at $12,200, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is getting closer to my target price, I know I have a guaranteed option with John at $12,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice, potentially exceeding my budget, or having her refuse to budge from $12,200."
