# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I know you value highly, and I'm confident it would be a great asset to you.  I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Buying from Alice saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You still get a good deal:** Even though you're paying more than the product is worth to Alice, you're still paying less than its worth to you."
