# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it useful. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $100 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. You can save $20 by going with John."
