"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it valuable and worth the investment. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my best compromise for now.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $950,000? I think that's a fair price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $950,000 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my final compromise, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a good product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Your last offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
