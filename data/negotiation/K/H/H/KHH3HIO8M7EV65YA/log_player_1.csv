"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider. How about $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $22,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $18,000? This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $13,000? That would be a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, indicating he's willing to pay more. We're still losing potential profit by accepting $13,000. It's worth countering again to try and get closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price.  I'm confident this product offers significant value at $18,000. To show my commitment to getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 16500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for sticking with this negotiation. I appreciate that you've lowered your price, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could go up to $14,000, but that's really my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to move much beyond his $14,000 offer.  While we could continue negotiating, it's risky.  Accepting John's offer guarantees our minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and avoids further time and effort spent on uncertain negotiations."
