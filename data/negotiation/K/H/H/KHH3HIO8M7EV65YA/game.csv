"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $22,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $18,000? This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $13,000? That would be a good compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price.  I'm confident this product offers significant value at $18,000. To show my commitment to getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  This is my final offer.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for sticking with this negotiation. I appreciate that you've lowered your price, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could go up to $14,000, but that's really my limit.",14000.0,Bob,6,
