"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1250000 to find a middle ground. This still represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to achieve a fair price for my product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1100000. This represents a significant investment on my part and hopefully allows us to reach a fair agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
