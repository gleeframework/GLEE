Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I want to see if Bob values the product highly enough to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm countering with $12,000. This is a compromise,  halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm about the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more,  I don't want to risk losing the sale and getting stuck with the product. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and move on."
