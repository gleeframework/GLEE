"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This gives you a significant advantage while still allowing me to earn a substantial return.  Let me know your thoughts.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is selling for $1,100,000 while John wants $1,200,000. 
* **You still get a good deal:**  Even though the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, you're getting it for $100,000 less.  

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best financial decision."
