"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the pricing. While $775,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This reflects the significant value the product holds for you, and it's a fair compromise considering my own needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
