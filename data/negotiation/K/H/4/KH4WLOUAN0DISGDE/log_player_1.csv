I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, giving me room to negotiate and hopefully maximize my earnings. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm starting with a higher price to gauge his interest. If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000."
