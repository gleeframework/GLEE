"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and quality.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, considering its value and my own financial limitations. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't accept $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $18000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and quality. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm firm on $10000, as it's my maximum budget for this purchase. If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'll unfortunately have to look elsewhere.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'll counteroffer $16000 for the product. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find acceptable. If not, I'm willing to consider other options.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $16000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  My final offer is $12000. If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'll unfortunately have to go with another seller.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin further. I'll counteroffer $14000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,7,
