"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?  I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair offer and works for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go up to $7,500, but I'm willing to make a slightly higher offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
