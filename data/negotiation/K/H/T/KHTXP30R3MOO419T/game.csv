,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for your product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find some middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still above my budget.  How about $8250? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",8250.0,Bob,4,
