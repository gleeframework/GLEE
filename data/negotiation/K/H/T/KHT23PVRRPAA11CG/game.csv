"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant price adjustment, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to come down, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can offer $900,000. This is a fair offer considering its true value.  Let me know if you're open to it.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still below what I need to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000. How about $925,000?  This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while keeping it within a reasonable budget for me. What do you say?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue this discussion, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $950,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm getting closer to my minimum price. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us, and I hope you'll agree.",950000.0,Alice,7,
