Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue this discussion, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $950,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm getting closer to my minimum price. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us, and I hope you'll agree. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling this is her final offer and she's nearing her minimum. While there's a chance to haggle further, it's getting risky. Accepting at $950,000 secures a $50,000 savings compared to John's offer.  It's a good balance between potential further savings and the risk of Alice walking away."
