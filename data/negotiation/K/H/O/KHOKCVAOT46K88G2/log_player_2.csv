"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $180 is way over his budget of $120. He should try to negotiate with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $120. Would you be willing to come down to $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, $155 is still above his limit of $120. He can try to negotiate further, or simply buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably spend.  How about $140?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my budget."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $145? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to sweeten the pot. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  While $145 is close to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to spend. John offers a price that fits perfectly within his budget, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a lower price."
