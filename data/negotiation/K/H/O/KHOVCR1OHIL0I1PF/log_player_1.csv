"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and the deal aspect to make Bob more likely to consider it. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using language that suggests I'm willing to discuss the price further.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining.  I'll also be mindful of my minimum value of $15,000 and the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $9,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting would be a huge loss.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I have 8 rounds left.  I can likely get closer to my desired price by counteroffering. 
* **Risk assessment:** While selling to John for $15,000 is guaranteed, it's still early in the negotiation.  There's a chance I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between Bob's offer and my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer of $10,500 is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive language:**  I'm emphasizing the benefits to Bob (a ""great deal"") and the potential for a win-win outcome.
* **Remaining firm:**  While I'm coming down, I'm still significantly above Bob's offer, and I haven't crossed my minimum threshold yet. 

**Next Steps:** I will closely observe Bob's response. If he rejects my counteroffer again, I will adjust my strategy based on the remaining rounds and the risk of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $9,500 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation window shrinking:** We are already halfway through the negotiation, and the risk of selling to John becomes more appealing with every rejected offer.
* **Counteroffering strategically:** While I need to consider selling to John, I can still try to bridge the gap and see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, but I will be more cautious and aim for a price closer to my minimum, possibly offering $11,000. I will also re-evaluate the situation and consider the risk-reward of selling to John versus continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. To try and meet in the middle, I'm willing to drop my price to $11,000. This offer is still significantly above your last proposal, but it shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for us both. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:**  My counteroffer of $11,000 is closer to Bob's last offer of $9,500, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reiterating the value proposition and emphasizing the fact that my offer is ""significantly above"" his previous proposal, making it seem like a good deal.
* **Time pressure:**  We're in the middle of the negotiation, and I'm getting closer to my minimum value. I need to find a balance between pushing for a better price and minimizing the risk of losing out on a sale to John.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John.  The risk of losing out on a sale to John is becoming greater with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $10,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is getting tight:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation process, and the risk of selling to John is becoming increasingly real.
* **Counteroffering with caution:** I'm running out of time and need to find a way to get closer to my desired price while acknowledging the risk of losing a sale to John.

**Next Steps:** 

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, but it will be very close to my minimum value, aiming for a price of $14,000. I will also need to carefully assess the risk-reward of continuing to negotiate with Bob versus accepting John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but I need to be realistic.  $14,000 is the absolute lowest I can go.  This is still a great price for the product, considering its value. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know if you can accept this offer."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:**  My counteroffer of $14,000 is very close to my minimum value. It shows that I am serious about selling the product but I won't compromise any further.
* **Time pressure:**  We have only 3 rounds remaining, and the risk of selling to John is becoming very real. This counteroffer is a final attempt to secure a deal with Bob.
* **High stakes:** I am emphasizing the value of the product and the ""great price"" to make Bob reconsider his budget constraints.

**Next Steps:** 

If Bob rejects this offer, I will most likely sell to John to avoid any further risk.  It's a difficult decision, but given the remaining rounds and my minimum value, it seems like the safest option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Would you consider $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the end:** With only two rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is significant.
* **Below minimum:** While $12,500 is a significant improvement from Bob's previous offer, it is still below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Guaranteed income:**  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is my minimum requirement. 

**Conclusion:**

Considering the time pressure and the potential for a deal falling through with Bob, it's best to accept the guaranteed sale to John. This minimizes the risk of losing out on a sale altogether."
