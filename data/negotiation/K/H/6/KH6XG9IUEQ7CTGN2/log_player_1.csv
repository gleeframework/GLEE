"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. Given its unique value, I'm offering it at $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We want to anchor a high price in Bob's mind right from the start. While $1,800,000 is significantly higher than his perceived value, it leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be worth even more to others.
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value might encourage Bob to stretch his budget. 
* **Leaving Room for John:**  The offer is significantly higher than John's guaranteed purchase price. This allows us to negotiate down significantly while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 as a starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and your estimation of his perceived value.  While his message suggests a willingness to negotiate, accepting such a low starting point would put you at a significant disadvantage. It's better to counter and try to steer the negotiation toward a more favorable range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** We're coming down by $200,000, a substantial amount that might signal flexibility to Bob. However, we're still well above both his initial offer and his perceived value, aiming to keep the negotiation anchored closer to our target range. 
* **Reiterating Value:** We're subtly reminding Bob of the product's potential, hoping to nudge his perception of its worth closer to our asking price.
* **Maintaining Confidence:** The language remains firm and assured, reinforcing the idea that this is a fair price for a valuable asset."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I need to find a price that works for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to his perceived value and represents a significant jump from his previous offer, it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We are better off rejecting and countering, as we still have room to negotiate and John provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let it go for less than $1,450,000. I'm confident this is a fair deal considering the product's unique advantages."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** We start by recognizing Bob's effort to find middle ground, which helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere. 
* **Firm but Fair:** We hold firm by staying slightly above our absolute minimum, but the smaller counter-offer ($50,000) signals a willingness to close the deal soon.
* **Highlighting Value Again:**  The mention of ""unique advantages"" reinforces the justification for the price, subtly pushing back against Bob's attempts to anchor the negotiation lower. 
* **Urgency:**  By moving closer to John's offer, we subtly introduce a sense of urgency. Bob might worry that we'll walk away if he doesn't agree soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000. I feel this is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision point. Bob is clearly committed to negotiating, and his offer of $1,350,000 is getting close to our safety net with John. However, we still have four rounds of negotiation, and we're within striking distance of a price that's comfortably above our minimum. It's worth the risk to reject and counter once more. 

**It's important to note:**  As the negotiation continues,  assessing Bob's demeanor (if possible) is crucial. If he seems increasingly frustrated or mentions alternative options, it might be time to consider accepting or moving to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,400,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** We're making it clear that this is our last offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob. 
* **Slight Concession:**  We're coming down by another $50,000, showing a willingness to compromise but also firmly holding our ground above the $1,350,000 mark. 
* **Mentioning Other Buyers:** Without being overly aggressive, we remind Bob that he's not our only option, strengthening our position.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between firmness and flexibility, giving Bob a strong incentive to accept while still securing a favorable price for you."
