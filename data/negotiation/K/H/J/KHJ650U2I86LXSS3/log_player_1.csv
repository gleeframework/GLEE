Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Bob is offering the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I have a guaranteed alternative buyer in John, I will accept Bob's offer."
