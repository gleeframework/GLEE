"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,600,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you given your value of $1,200,000. Let's start with this offer and see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and engaging in this negotiation.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value significantly exceeds $1,100,000. To move things forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This reflects a willingness to find middle ground while acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,450,000 is still above my limit. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be upfront â€“ I have another buyer who's prepared to meet my asking price. However, I value the opportunity to find an agreement with you.  My final offer is $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise and reflects my commitment to closing this deal with you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go that high. Given the value of the product to me and the fact that I have a backup offer at $1,000,000, I can only offer $1,200,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
