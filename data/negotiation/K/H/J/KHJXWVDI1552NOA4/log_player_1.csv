Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product will be incredibly valuable to you, just as it has been to me. I'm offering it to you for $1,900,000. I think it's a fair price considering its potential return on investment."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I'm in a strong position.  I can aim high with Bob because even if he rejects the offer, I'm not losing out.
* **Perceived Value:** By stating the product's value to both of us, I reinforce its significance.
* **Negotiation Room:** The high initial price provides room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also anchors his perception of the product's value at a higher point.

While this strategy is aggressive, it maximizes my potential profit. If Bob accepts, I'll earn significantly more than my minimum. If he rejects it, I still have my guaranteed sale to John."
