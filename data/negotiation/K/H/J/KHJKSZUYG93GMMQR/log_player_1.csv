Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Being friendly:** The message is friendly and open to negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer. 
* If the negotiation drags on, or if Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'll switch to selling the product to John for my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and only slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000.  
* **I have a better option:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, making selling to him the more advantageous option. 

**Next steps:** 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob that is closer to my desired price point. If he rejects my counteroffer, I will immediately sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant discount from my original price, but it shows I'm serious about making this deal work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** $9,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Creating urgency:** I'm emphasizing the discount from my original price to make Bob feel like he needs to act quickly.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts the offer, I'll finalize the sale.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll immediately sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $9,250. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $9,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **I have a better option:** I can sell to John for a price that meets my minimum requirements and ensures I don't lose out.
* **No further negotiation:** Continued negotiations with Bob would likely just waste time and energy. 

**Next steps:**

I will contact John and finalize the sale to him for $12,000."
