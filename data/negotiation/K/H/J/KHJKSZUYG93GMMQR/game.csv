"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant discount from my original price, but it shows I'm serious about making this deal work.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $9,250. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",9250.0,Bob,4,
