Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate and leaves open the possibility of getting a better price from Bob. If he rejects, I'll reassess my options based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $150.  I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering a price of $140. This is still higher than Bob's offer of $120 but lower than my initial offer of $175.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob while still getting me closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer of $110 is still too low for me.  It's below my minimum acceptable value of $150, and I'm not willing to go that low.  Since John is willing to pay $150, I'm going to sell the product to him instead."
