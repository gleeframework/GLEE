You're very close to your target price of $8,000!  It's worth trying to negotiate one more time with Alice to see if you can get that last bit of discount."

This counteroffer is a small increase from your last offer, signaling that you're willing to meet Alice halfway.  It's also just a bit higher than John's price, giving you a good justification for making one last push to see if Alice will budge."

Alice is being stubborn and you're only $850 away from your goal price. It's time to cut your losses and go with John.  You've already made significant progress in negotiating with Alice, but it's not worth risking getting stuck at a higher price than you're willing to pay.  John offers a guaranteed price within your budget."
