"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth $11000. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is close to Bob's limit, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $11,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to his maximum price while still leaving room for negotiation. By offering $10,500, Bob shows he's serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we aim for a middle ground? I would be willing to sell the product for $10750. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  However, it's getting closer.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to his limit, or at least keep Alice from raising the price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking with his previous counteroffer of $10,500.  He's shown he's willing to negotiate and has made a fair offer. By reiterating his previous offer, he's showing persistence and demonstrating that he's serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, how about we settle on $10600? This is a fair compromise, allowing us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,600 is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget, but it's getting very close. Bob should continue negotiating because there's a possibility Alice will come down further, especially with the time running out.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows Bob to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,600 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a fair price for both of us. It's the most I can afford, and I'm confident we can agree on this number.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again reiterating his previous offer of $10,500, showing persistence. He's emphasizing the fairness of the price and the urgency of closing the deal. This strategy aims to push Alice into accepting his offer. With only four rounds left, Bob needs to finalize the deal, or he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
