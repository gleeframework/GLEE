,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10600 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10500, which is a fair price for both of us. It's the most I can afford, and I'm confident we can agree on this number.  Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Bob,6,
