"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price that takes into account both of our needs. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $130 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $100 just doesn't work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  I'm confident you'll find this product is worth every penny.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $105.  What do you say?",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, but that's my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I might have to sell to another buyer.",110.0,Alice,7,
