"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value of the product, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. I'll be prepared to lower the price if necessary, but I'll use the 10 rounds to try to get as close to my minimum value as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my minimum price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90.  If you're open to that, we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more. It's worth trying to squeeze out a few more dollars before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $90 just doesn't quite work for me.  How about $93?  It's a small compromise on both sides, and we can finally close this deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 93}
```"
