"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential benefits it holds. Please let me know your decision. If you're not interested, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. You have no incentive to accept her offer because you can get the same product from John for the same price. By rejecting, you might even be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller."
