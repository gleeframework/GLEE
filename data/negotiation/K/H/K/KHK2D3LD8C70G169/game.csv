"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I agree your product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to let it go for $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal happen.",9250.0,Alice,3,
