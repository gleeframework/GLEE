"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's below your maximum price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffer:** You have a better chance of getting a lower price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's price is a backup:**  John's offer is your safety net if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint approach:**  This counteroffer is halfway between Alice's offer ($9,500) and the product's worth to her ($8,000). 
* **Fair compromise:**  It's a reasonable starting point for a potential compromise, giving Alice a bit of profit while still saving you a significant amount compared to her initial offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  If Alice rejects this offer, you can still adjust your offer slightly higher in the next round if needed, but you want to avoid going too high too quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  Alice's offer is still higher than the product's worth to her, which means there's still room to negotiate.
* **Potential for better price:**  By rejecting this offer and counteroffering, you might be able to get closer to your target price or even get Alice to accept a price closer to her value.
* **John's price is a backup:**  As before, John's offer acts as a safety net if negotiations with Alice ultimately fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** This counteroffer is slightly higher than your previous offer, showing Alice that you're willing to negotiate but not willing to pay her full asking price.
* **Reaching a middle ground:** It's halfway between your previous offer ($8500) and Alice's current offer ($9000), increasing the likelihood of finding a compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By not jumping too high with your counteroffer, you retain leverage and can still adjust your offer in future rounds if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** Alice's offer is only $100 above the product's worth to her ($8,000).  It's very close to your target price, and you're likely to save a significant amount compared to John's offer.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While you could counteroffer, there's a risk that Alice will counter back, leading to a prolonged negotiation with no guarantee of a lower price.
* **Time and effort:**  Accepting this offer avoids further rounds of negotiation, saving you time and effort. 

By accepting this offer, you get a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing out on the product or wasting time in negotiations."
