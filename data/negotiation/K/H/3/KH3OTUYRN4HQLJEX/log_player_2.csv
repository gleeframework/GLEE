"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible, and $90 is still a bit too high.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm thinking around $75. Would you be willing to go that low?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still confident this product is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still looking to save more money.  While $82.50 is closer to your ideal price, you can likely push for a lower offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. How about $80? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $85. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $84. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $84
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, it's likely you've reached the best deal you can get from Alice. Accepting her offer for $84 saves you $36 compared to buying from John.  While you might be able to push for a lower price, it's risky given the limited rounds and the possibility that Alice will walk away."
