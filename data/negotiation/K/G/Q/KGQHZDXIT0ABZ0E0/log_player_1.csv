Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair.  This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a very profitable range for me.
* **Consider the Alternative:** I have a guaranteed offer of $800,000 from John, so my offer to Bob needs to be significantly higher to be worthwhile.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, increasing the chances of a successful sale to Bob at a price significantly above my minimum."
