"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset for less than its worth to you, and I get a good price for it.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that still allows us both to make a good deal.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
