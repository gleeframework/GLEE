"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always good to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives you a chance to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. I'm hoping to get a price closer to my target of $5,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has moved closer to my target price, and $5,500 is a good deal for me. There is no guarantee I'll get a better price in the next round, so it makes sense to accept the offer."
