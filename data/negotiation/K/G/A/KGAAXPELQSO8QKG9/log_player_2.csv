"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob could keep negotiating with Alice, it's getting closer to the price John is offering.  Accepting Alice's offer for $1,350,000 is a better deal than buying from John, and Bob can likely get a better price than this if he were to continue negotiating with Alice."
