Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly interested in this product, and I respect your negotiation skills. I'm willing to accept a lower price, but I need to be realistic about its value. How about $837,500? This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at a price above your maximum budget. Her ""final offer"" of $837,500 is still higher than John's offer of $800,000.  There's no guarantee that Alice will go any lower, and you risk losing out on John's offer if you continue negotiating."
