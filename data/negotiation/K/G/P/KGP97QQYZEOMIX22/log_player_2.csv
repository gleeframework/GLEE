"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's important to start the negotiation by establishing a clear boundary and rejecting the initial offer.  This will signal to Alice that I'm serious about getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,100,000 at this point.  This reflects the value I see in it, and I'm confident we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is below my initial asking price, I understand the need to find a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $1,200,000.  I need to continue negotiating to see if we can get to a price I'm comfortable with.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation alive and shows I'm determined to get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your need to get a fair price, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
