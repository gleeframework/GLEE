"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  $2,300,000 is not within my budget. I could consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product. While $2,300,000 represents its true worth, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.  This offer reflects a significant reduction on my end and ensures you're getting a good deal on an exceptional product.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,850,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer that recognizes its value while fitting within my financial constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,550,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're trying to meet me halfway. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000. This is a strong offer, and I hope we can make a deal at this price.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting close.  To be frank, I have a hard limit on what I can accept.  I can come down slightly to $1,475,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",1475000.0,Alice,7,
