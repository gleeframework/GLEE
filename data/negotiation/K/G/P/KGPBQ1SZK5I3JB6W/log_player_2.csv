"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating. There are 9 more rounds, and Bob has time to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $11,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by offering a price that's closer to his desired price point but still leaves room for compromise. By offering $10,500, Bob shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but also demonstrates his willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer allows for a reasonable starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm still confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $10,800 is well within Bob's budget of $12,000 and significantly lower than John's price. 
* **Progress:** Alice has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, moving closer to Bob's desired price.
* **Risk:**  There's a risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and potentially driving the price back up. Accepting the offer ensures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation. 

Bob should accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a favorable price."
