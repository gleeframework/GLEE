"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $14,000. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $12,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $12,500 is a fair offer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price point. Could you do $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than John's price of $15,000.  There's not much room for further negotiation, so accepting this offer is the best course of action to save money."
