"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's a good starting point to negotiate and try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering this product. However, $2,250,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is my maximum for this product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've described."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but my initial offer reflects the true value and potential this product holds.  To move towards a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to $2,000,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. While she has lowered the price, it's not enough for Bob to accept. Bob should continue negotiating to try to get a price closer to his budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that this product is worth $1,500,000, and I'm prepared to pay that amount. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a significant compromise while still reflecting the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, and it might give Alice an incentive to lower the price further. Bob can continue to make counteroffers and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,500,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
