"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $10,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and propose a new price of $12,200. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm a little surprised to see the price go up. I'm still very interested in the product, but I need us to be closer to my budget.  To be frank, if we can't agree on a price around $10,500, I might have to consider other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
