"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe the product's value will benefit you in the long run, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product. If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll have to take my business elsewhere.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what you're willing to pay.",10500.0,Alice,5,
