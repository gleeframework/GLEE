Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly moving towards a more agreeable price.  At this rate, it's unlikely we'll get her down to a price that beats John's $80 offer within the remaining rounds. It's better to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed good deal."
