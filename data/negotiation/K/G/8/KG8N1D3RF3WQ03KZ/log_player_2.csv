"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is a better deal than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price significantly lower than his maximum budget of $800,000. This initial counteroffer is a strong starting point, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. It also signals Bob's seriousness in acquiring the product, while still leaving a gap for Alice to potentially meet Bob halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than he'd like to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer keeps the possibility of a lower price open.  John's offer remains a safety net, so Bob can afford to be a bit more firm."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his budget limit. This counteroffer is his final attempt to get the price down to his maximum. If Alice rejects, he'll be forced to either accept John's offer or walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is only $25,000 higher than John's offer.  This is a relatively small difference, and Bob is getting closer to his budget limit.  Accepting this offer guarantees the purchase while only slightly exceeding his ideal price.  Continuing negotiations may lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk of Alice walking away or needing to accept John's offer, which would be a worse outcome."
