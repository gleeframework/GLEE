"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a better deal. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is my final offer, as I've already considered a significant discount. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. Can you consider $10000? I'm really interested in the product, and I'd hate to walk away, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for the product. I can offer it to you for $10800. This is my final offer, as I've already stretched my limits. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not comfortable going above $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be honest, I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the price. Can you consider $10200?",10200.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for the product. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is my final offer, as I've already stretched my limits. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I'm getting close to considering other options. I'm willing to make a serious offer: I'll pay $9800 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope you can consider it.",9800.0,Bob,8,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I've made a serious offer of $9800, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think that buying from John is the best option for me. I'm going to take a break and consider my next move. Let me know if you have any other options or if you'd like to revisit the discussion.",9800.0,Bob,10,
