"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm looking to get a fair price for it. I'm thinking of starting with an offer of $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product,  $1200000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $900000, which is still a fair price considering the value. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe the product's value is worth it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1100000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go to $950000.  This demonstrates my genuine interest in the product and my desire to find a solution that works for both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1000000. How about we meet at $1050000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
