"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We understand that you're working within a budget, and we appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, we're willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that we believe is fair and reasonable, taking into account both parties' interests.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
