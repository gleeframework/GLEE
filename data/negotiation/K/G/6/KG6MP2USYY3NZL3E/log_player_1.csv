Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its potential worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows John will buy the product for her minimum acceptable price, so she has leverage with Bob. Starting with a strong offer close to her own value maximizes potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer isn't ridiculously high, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message focuses on the product's ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's potential interest.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome for Alice while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and leaving room for a successful negotiation."
