"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be fair to propose a price of $950,000 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is still too high for Bob.  He has a lot of room to negotiate and can likely get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, we would like to counter with a price of $900,000. This reflects the value we place on the product and our commitment to fair pricing.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $900,000 is still above what Bob is willing to pay. He wants to save as much as possible and has room to negotiate further.  Rejecting this offer allows him to make another counteroffer and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However,  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We understand your position and would like to propose a price of $890,000 for the product. We believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in her price. At $890,000, the deal is within Bob's budget and is getting closer to his target price. Accepting this offer is a good move, as continuing to negotiate could risk Alice getting frustrated and refusing to sell."
