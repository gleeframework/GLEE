Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept, I'm going to try and squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $1,550,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but closer to my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, this will be enough to get Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I've already given him two counteroffers. At this point, it's clear that we are not going to reach an agreement. I'm better off selling to John for $1,500,000."
