"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I can't quite agree to that price.  How about we meet in the middle somewhat?  Would you consider $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,275,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but no more. I'm hoping we can meet at a price that works for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
