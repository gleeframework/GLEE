"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

Bob is offering $8,500, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer.  This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it signals that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also unwilling to pay the full asking price."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $8,750. This shows Alice he is willing to compromise, while still trying to stay below his $8,000 limit. This is a reasonable counteroffer, as it is halfway between his last offer and Alice's latest offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's the closest Alice has come to his budget, it's still $900 over his limit. With 5 rounds remaining, Bob has time to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

Bob is offering $8,800, which is just $100 above his maximum budget. He's showing that he's serious about buying the product, but he's not willing to go any higher. This is a strategic move to see if Alice is willing to concede a little more to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,850

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's very close to his budget, he still has a few rounds left and can try to push for a better price. There's a chance Alice will concede further in the remaining rounds to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer of $8,800.  He's shown that he's willing to pay a price that's just a bit above his maximum budget, but he's not going to go any higher. This strategy could work in his favor, as Alice may be more likely to accept a slightly lower price than risk losing the sale altogether with only a few rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,825. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,825
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  It's the last round, and while Alice's offer is very close to his maximum budget, it's still over his limit.  He's already shown his willingness to negotiate, and Alice doesn't seem ready to budge further. It's better to buy from John and avoid going further over budget."
