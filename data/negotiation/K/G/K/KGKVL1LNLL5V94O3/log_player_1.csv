"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm looking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $150, knowing that Bob values the product at $80.  This gives us room to negotiate.  I'm confident I can get a price closer to my minimum of $120 within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to take the $60, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  While $105 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $75? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum of $120, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I believe I can get a better offer from Bob.  I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $75 is still too low for me.  Let's try $90.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
