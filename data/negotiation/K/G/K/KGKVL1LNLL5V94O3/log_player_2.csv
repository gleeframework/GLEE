"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm looking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $60 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in a negotiation. It leaves room for you to gradually increase your offer while staying well below your $80 maximum.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This counter-offer will help you understand how willing Alice is to negotiate.  If she outright rejects $60, you know you'll need to go higher. 
* **Alternative Option:** You always have John's offer of $80 in your back pocket if the negotiation with Alice doesn't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $105 is still significantly over your $80 budget. While Alice moved from her initial offer, it's not enough of a concession.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still a considerable gap between your offer and Alice's. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a more acceptable price.
* **John's Offer:** Remember, you can always buy from John for $80 if the negotiations with Alice don't yield a good price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  While $105 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $75? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  You increased your offer from $60 to $75, showing Alice you're willing to negotiate but remaining firm within a reasonable range of your budget.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating you're ready to close the deal at $75, you add a bit of pressure without being overly aggressive.
* **Below John's Price:** Your offer remains strategically below John's $80 price, leaving room for potential further negotiation with Alice if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $75 is still too low for me.  Let's try $90.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Over Budget:** $90 is still above your $80 budget.
* **Slow Progress:** While Alice is negotiating, the progress is slow. You're at round 5 out of 10, and she's only come down $60 from her initial offer. 
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $80, ensuring you won't overspend and can get the product.

It's unlikely Alice will come down to your desired price range quickly enough, so it's more strategic to buy from John."
