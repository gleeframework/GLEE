{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and the price is getting close to her perceived value.  While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk Alice will walk away, and we'll be stuck paying John's higher price.  Accepting at $8,100 secures a decent discount."
