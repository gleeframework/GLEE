"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the potential value, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget right now.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800,000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm confident this product will generate significant returns for you, so I'm willing to lower the price to $1,000,000. This reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement.  Let me know if you're open to this compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
