Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This price is still significantly higher than what it's worth to you and allows for a profitable transaction. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
