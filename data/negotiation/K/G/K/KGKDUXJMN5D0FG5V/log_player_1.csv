{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without him rejecting the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $130 is a strong starting point, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down if he wants.
* **Backup Option:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John, ensuring we won't make a loss. 

By starting high, we aim to maximize potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
