,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $75?  I'm really interested in the product and think that's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the price.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82.50 is still a bit high for me. How about $80?  That's my absolute limit, and I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",80.0,Bob,4,
