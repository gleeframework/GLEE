"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,250,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?  This would still give you a great deal, and I could move forward with the sale.  Let me know your thoughts.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
