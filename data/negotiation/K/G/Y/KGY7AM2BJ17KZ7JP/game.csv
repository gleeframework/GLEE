"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects the true value of this item. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth $10,000 to me at most. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $14,000 is still too high for my budget. I could potentially go up to $9,000. Would that work for you?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, I need to get at least $12,000 for this product. Would you be willing to meet at that price?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is pushing it for me.  My absolute maximum I could offer is $9,500.  Let me know if that's acceptable.",9500.0,Bob,6,
