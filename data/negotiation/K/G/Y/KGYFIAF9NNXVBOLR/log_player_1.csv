{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, leaving room for potential counteroffers while still ensuring you get a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than your desired profit margin. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially reaching a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit margin. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $850,000. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than your initial goal, it's only $25,000 less than your counteroffer, and it's a significant improvement over selling to John.  It's better to close the deal at this point and secure a profitable sale."
