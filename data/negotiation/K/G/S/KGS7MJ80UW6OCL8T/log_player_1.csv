Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $9,500.  I believe it will greatly benefit you and it's a fantastic deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than John's offer.
* **Create Urgency:** The ""limited time"" phrase adds a bit of pressure for Bob to act quickly and increases the chance of a sale. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
