"I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can we meet in the middle at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $825,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my need to get a decent return on my investment.  What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $850,000. This is my final offer, please let me know if it's acceptable to you.",850000.0,Bob,4,
