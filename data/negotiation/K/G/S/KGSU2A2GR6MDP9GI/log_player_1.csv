Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $900,000 is higher than the $800,000 Bob values the product at, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's below your minimum of $1,000,000, leaving you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It's a strong initial offer:** It shows you're serious about selling to Bob, but you're not giving away the farm. 

By starting with a strong offer and leaving room for negotiation, you increase your chances of reaching a deal that's beneficial to both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can we meet in the middle at $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $825,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you'd ideally like to get. There's room for further negotiation with Bob.  By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're not desperate to sell at his price, and you maintain your leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $825,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my need to get a decent return on my investment.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable price point.
* **Is within your range:** $875,000 is still above your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** It creates space for a potential middle ground that both parties can agree on.

By offering a counteroffer, you're continuing the negotiation process and working towards a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $850,000. This is my final offer, please let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is still less than your ideal price, it's a decent offer considering Bob's stated budget constraints.  It's also worth noting that Bob explicitly called this his ""final offer.""  Rejecting this offer risks losing the deal altogether, leaving you with only the option of selling to John for $1,000,000.

Considering the potential for further negotiation to stall or completely break down, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice at this point. It secures a sale and ensures a good return on your investment."
