# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price of $100. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($100) is within your budget of $120.** 
* **You can save $20 compared to buying from John.** 
* While the product is only worth $80 to Alice, that's irrelevant to your decision. You're focusing on getting the best deal within your budget."
