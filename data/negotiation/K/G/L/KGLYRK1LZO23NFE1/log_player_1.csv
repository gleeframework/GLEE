Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants a lower price.  I'll be watching closely for Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $9,000. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,200.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still higher than John's offer and gets me closer to my target. It's also clear that Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my desired price, which suggests that I could potentially get an even better offer if I continued to negotiate. However, the risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer and potentially lowering his offer further is not worth the potential gain. Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the best decision in this situation."
