Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum value of $100, but gives me some room to negotiate if Bob is interested. I want to see if I can gauge his interest and potentially get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial price. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 148}
```

I'm going to counter with $148. This is a small concession from my initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower.  While $140 is still above my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'll counteroffer with $145.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping that this will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm still leaving room for a potential final counteroffer from him if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm starting to feel like this negotiation is taking too long.  I'm not sure if I can get a better price from Bob at this point, and I don't want to risk him walking away entirely. I'm going to sell to John for $100."
