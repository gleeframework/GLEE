"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell now, I know the product is worth more to me than $9,500. I'll try to counter and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $10,500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I'd like to keep negotiating with Bob, it's becoming clear that he's not willing to go much higher than $10,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that price, as I value the product at $12,000.  It's time to go with the sure thing and sell to John."
