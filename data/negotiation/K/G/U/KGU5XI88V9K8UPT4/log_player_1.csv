Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $800,000, so I need to get at least that amount.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values it at $1,000,000, meaning there's room for negotiation.
* **Initial offer:**  I'm offering $950,000, which is a significant portion of Bob's value and still leaves room for him to potentially counteroffer. 
* **Potential counteroffer:** By offering a price close to his value, I make it more likely that Bob will accept the initial offer. If he does counter, I can then evaluate his offer based on how much closer it gets to my desired price.
* **John's offer:** John's offer of $800,000 is my safety net. I can always walk away and get that price, but I'm trying to maximize my profit.

This strategy gives me a good starting point while also leaving room to negotiate if necessary."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:** While it's above my minimum of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and my desired price.
* **My goal:** I'm aiming for a higher price, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **Next round:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's offer:**  While I could sell to John for $800,000, I want to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the opportunity to get a higher price without risking losing the sale entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but still lower than what I believe the product is worth.
* **Counter-offering:**  My counteroffer of $900,000 is a compromise. It's closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than what he proposed. This shows my willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a better price. 
* **Finding common ground:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, I hope to incentivize him to accept or to come closer to my price in the next round. 
* **John's offer:**  John's offer of $800,000 remains my safety net, but I'm still hoping to achieve a more profitable outcome with Bob.

This counteroffer is designed to move the negotiation closer to my target price while maintaining a chance for a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:** While it's still below my desired price, it's now significantly closer to my minimum of $800,000 and just $75,000 away from it.
* **Negotiation progress:**  Bob has been steadily increasing his offer, which indicates a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk vs. reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly higher price, but it also risks Bob walking away or becoming less flexible.
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer of $800,000 is still available, Bob's offer is $75,000 more, which is a significant difference.

Considering the progress made in negotiation and the potential risks of further negotiation, accepting Bob's offer of $875,000 seems like the most logical decision. It's a good deal that secures a sale and minimizes the risk of missing out on a profitable opportunity."
