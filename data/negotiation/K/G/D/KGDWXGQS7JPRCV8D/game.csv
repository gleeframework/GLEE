"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant potential for you, even beyond your initial assessment.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,112,500?",1112500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,112,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I can also consider $1,092,500. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",1092500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. How about we settle this right now at $1,101,250? It's a strong price that recognizes the value you're gaining.",1101250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,095,000, but I'd like to get even closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,097,500?",1097500.0,Bob,6,
