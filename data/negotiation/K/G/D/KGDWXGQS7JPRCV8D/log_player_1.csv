"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, creating a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm prepared to negotiate, but I want to gauge Bob's initial reaction and willingness to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my target price. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter-offer in Round 3 to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant potential for you, even beyond your initial assessment.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,112,500?"", 
""product_price"": 1112500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection with Justification:** I politely reject Bob's offer, explaining that it falls short of my expectations.
* **Highlighting Potential:** I reinforce the product's value and potential, subtly reminding Bob of the missed opportunity if we don't reach an agreement.
* **Compromise:** I propose a counteroffer that splits the difference between our previous offers. This demonstrates flexibility while still striving for a strong price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,112,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I can also consider $1,092,500. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,092,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,092,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and negotiating, but he's incrementally increasing his offer.  While $1,092,500 is tempting, I believe I can still get closer to $1,100,000, especially with several rounds left.  I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. How about we settle this right now at $1,101,250? It's a strong price that recognizes the value you're gaining."", 
""product_price"": 1101250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Interest:** I want to reinforce that I see Bob as a serious buyer, encouraging him to close the deal.
* **Finality and Value:** I'm framing this counteroffer as a final offer to expedite the process while still aiming for a price slightly above his last offer.
* **Slight Concession:** By coming down slightly, I signal a willingness to compromise, but I'm holding firm above $1,100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,095,000, but I'd like to get even closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,097,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,097,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,097,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Strong Offer:** $1,097,500 is a very good offer. It's significantly above my minimum and close to my ideal price.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  We've been going back and forth for several rounds.  Continuing could risk Bob's interest or lead to smaller concessions.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I might squeeze out a bit more, the difference is likely small compared to the risk of Bob walking away entirely. 

This offer represents a solid win for both parties."
