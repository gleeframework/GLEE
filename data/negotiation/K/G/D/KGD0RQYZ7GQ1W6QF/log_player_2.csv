"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I can see that you're interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $725,000 and my previous offer of $1,000,000. I'm offering a price of $912,500. This is a compromise that should be more acceptable to both of us. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still think the product is worth more than $818,000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'll meet you at $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?

It's time to cut bait. Alice is very unlikely to go below $800,000 and has indicated this is her final offer. You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price."
