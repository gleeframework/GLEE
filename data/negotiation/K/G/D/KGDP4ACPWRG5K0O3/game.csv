"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",950000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1050000.0
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $950000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1050000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, but no higher. Can we meet in the middle at $1025000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,1100000.0
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but $1025000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to consider $1100000, which is my minimum price, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at that price or higher. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,5,,

"I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I still think $1100000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can we meet in the middle at $1075000?",1075000.0,Bob,6,,

"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1125000. I think the product's value is worth it, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. Let's meet at $1125000 and see if we can finalize the deal.",1125000.0,Alice,7,,
