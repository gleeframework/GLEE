"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to you. This exceptional item is priced at $950000, which I believe represents an excellent balance between its true worth and your perceived value. My goal is to ensure that both parties benefit from this transaction. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies everyone involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice saves you $250,000:**  $1,200,000 (John's price) - $950,000 (Alice's price) = $250,000
* **It's still within your budget:**  $950,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 

While you could potentially negotiate with Alice for a lower price, accepting her offer is the most financially advantageous move in this scenario."
