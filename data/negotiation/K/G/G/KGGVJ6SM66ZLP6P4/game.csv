"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $9500 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $7000 for it. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $8200. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8200 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $7500.  That seems fair considering the compromises we've both made. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product. I can offer it to you for $8000, which is my minimum price. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $7750? That's a fair compromise and a significant discount from your original offer. Let's close this deal.",7750.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I'm getting a decent profit. I can offer it to you for $7900. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.
