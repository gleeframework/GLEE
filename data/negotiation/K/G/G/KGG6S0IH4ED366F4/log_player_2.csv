"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a fantastic opportunity for you, Bob! This product is a rare find and I'm willing to let it go for a steal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $110. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While Alice's offer of $110 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a counter-offer, allowing you to save even more money."
