"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree the product is unique, $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $500,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects my budget."", ""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Explanation:** We start with a significantly lower offer ($500,000) to gauge Alice's flexibility. This tactic leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a substantial discount. The message is framed positively, expressing interest and a desire for a mutually beneficial deal."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $800,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the effort to find a compromise. While $700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $600,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Explanation:** We acknowledge Alice's compromise but stand firm on seeking a lower price. By suggesting $600,000, we aim for the middle ground between her current offer and our previous counteroffer.  We maintain a collaborative tone, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $650,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000.

```explanation: Alice has come down considerably and stated this is her final offer.  While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk she'll stand firm, and we'd end up with John's offer of $1,000,000.  Accepting $650,000 secures a significant discount and avoids the risk of losing the deal.```"
