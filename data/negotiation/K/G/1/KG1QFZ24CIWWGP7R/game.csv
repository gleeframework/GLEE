"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree the product is unique, $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $500,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects my budget.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $800,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the effort to find a compromise. While $700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $600,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $650,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",650000.0,Alice,5,
