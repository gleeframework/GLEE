"I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
