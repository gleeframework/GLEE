"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but we still need to ensure we're fairly compensated for the value the product brings. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. We believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account your concerns while still recognizing the product's worth.",750000.0,Alice,3,
