"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good deal for Bob.  While he values the product at $1,200,000, he can acquire it for $300,000 less than buying from John. This saves him a significant amount of money."
