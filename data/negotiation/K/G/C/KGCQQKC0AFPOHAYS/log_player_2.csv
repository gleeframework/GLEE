Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay, and you've already stated your maximum.  It's better to go with John's offer and secure the product at your desired price."
