Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:** This leaves me room to negotiate and still make a profit.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  This makes it more likely Bob will accept or at least counteroffer.

I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup option, which will help me if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** and proceed to the next round. While I'd love to make a sale, $10,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my minimum."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I really appreciate your flexibility. However, I still can't go above $10,000 for the product. I hope this meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob has made it clear that he won't budge from his $10,000 offer.  While I appreciate his persistence, this is just too far below my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000.  I'd rather make a decent profit than continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting nothing."
