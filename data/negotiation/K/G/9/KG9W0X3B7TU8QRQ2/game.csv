"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the product's value, $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's potential benefits to my business. I'm open to further discussion if you have any concerns.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to accept $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $725,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this price reflects the product's worth and is a fair deal for both parties.",725000.0,Alice,3,
