"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get closer to your target price of $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with a price of $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a reasonable price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than your budget.  You can likely still negotiate a better price, as you are only $25,000 away from your desired price.  Rejecting the offer will allow you to try and get even closer to your target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,000,000. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm not willing to sell it to you for less than $1,100,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has returned to her original offer of $1,100,000. You've shown your willingness to negotiate, but she's not budging further. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $1,000,000. You'll save $100,000 compared to Alice's final offer. While you may have hoped for a better deal from Alice, it's not worth risking further negotiations that might not be successful."
