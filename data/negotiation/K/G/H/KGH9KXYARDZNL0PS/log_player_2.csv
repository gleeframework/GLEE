"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This item is not just any commodity; it's an investment in excellence and efficiency. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth every penny of the $10,000 you're willing to pay. However, to facilitate a transaction, I propose a price of $9,500. This offer allows us both to benefit: you receive a high-quality product at a reasonable price, and I secure a sale that exceeds my cost while maximizing my earnings. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further terms. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is starting at $9,500, which is too high.  You know you have a backup option at $10,000 with John, but there's room to negotiate with Alice. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price."
