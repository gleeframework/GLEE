"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the transaction. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,250,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. Would you consider $1,125,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $1,187,500? This is a significant concession from my side, and I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. Let's get this deal done!",1187500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting close! I'm willing to bump my offer up a bit to meet you closer to the middle. Would you be willing to settle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
