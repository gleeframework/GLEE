"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the transaction. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not desperate enough to accept such a low offer this early in the game."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,250,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. Would you consider $1,125,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,125,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a bit too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a deal that leaves me significantly under my desired price. There are still more rounds, and I might be able to get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $1,187,500? This is a significant concession from my side, and I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1187500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting close! I'm willing to bump my offer up a bit to meet you closer to the middle. Would you be willing to settle at $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,150,000 is tempting, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a few more rounds of negotiation.  I'm not in a rush to sell, so I can afford to be patient and see if Bob will come up further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still hoping we can reach a deal that's mutually beneficial.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,162,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1162500}
