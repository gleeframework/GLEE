"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth more than $120 to you. Given its exceptional quality and unique features, I would like to propose a fair price of $150 for it. I understand that this might be higher than what you were expecting, but I assure you that it reflects the true value of the product. Please let me know if this offer suits you, or if you have any other suggestions for a price that would work for both of us.",150.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",120.0,Bob,2,
