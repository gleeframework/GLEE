{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $950,000 is above your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You're not asking for the full $1,000,000 value to Bob, giving him space to counter and potentially find a mutually agreeable price.
* **It shows you're serious about the deal:** Offering a specific price indicates you're ready to negotiate."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to my business.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more to you than that.  Let's find a compromise.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business.
