"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value this product brings to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our needs and the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $950,000 is your maximum budget, and I'm willing to meet you there. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
