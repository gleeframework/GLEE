"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, but she's offering it for $1,200,000. That means there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."

I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Bob has reached his maximum budget of $950,000, and Alice's final offer of $1,050,000 is still above that.  It's time for Bob to secure the product and avoid any further negotiation. Buying from John at $800,000 is the best option."
