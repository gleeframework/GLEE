"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Since you're willing to pay up to $120, there's room for a counteroffer that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
