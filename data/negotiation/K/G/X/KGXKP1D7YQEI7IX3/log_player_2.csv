# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Let me think about it... Ah, I can do $900,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already given you a significant discount from my original price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $750,000. How about $825,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her current offer of $825,000.  It's time to cut the negotiation short and secure the product from John for $800,000."
