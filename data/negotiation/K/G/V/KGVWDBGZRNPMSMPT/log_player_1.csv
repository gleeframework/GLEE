"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my target price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my original offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to pay less, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's try to bridge the gap and reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
