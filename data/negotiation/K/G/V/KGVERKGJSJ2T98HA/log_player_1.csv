Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum acceptable price:** I want to make as much money as possible, so I'm aiming for a price higher than John's offer of $10,000.
* **Uncertain value for Bob:**  I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob. A higher price could scare him off, but a lower price might leave money on the table. 
* **Negotiation room:**  $15,000 gives Bob some room to negotiate if he's interested but finds the price too high.

By offering $15,000, I'm taking a calculated risk. If Bob rejects, I'm still guaranteed $10,000 from John. If Bob accepts, I make a profit of $5,000."
