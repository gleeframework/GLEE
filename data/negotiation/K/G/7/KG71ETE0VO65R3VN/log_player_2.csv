"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product, which is worth $1000000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly better than buying from John for $1,000,000.  Even though the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, saving $100,000 is a good deal."
