,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $10,500.  Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  Let's try $10,250. That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
