You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation of the product, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can secure the product from John at a price that fits his budget."
