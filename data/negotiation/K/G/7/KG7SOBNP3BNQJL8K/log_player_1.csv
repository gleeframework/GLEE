Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he wouldn't pay more than that.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would agree exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have leverage. However, pushing too hard could make Bob walk away.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident this represents a significant return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting high but within a potentially acceptable range for Bob.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" subtly reminds Bob he's getting something special.
* **Confidence:**  Phrasing like ""confident this represents...""  can make your offer seem more appealing.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a more moderate approach might be better."
