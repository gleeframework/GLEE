"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I think it's worth closer to $700,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. Can you consider this offer?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below my valuation for this product. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can find a better middle ground. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but it's more in line with my budget. Can you consider this offer?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is closer to my bottom line, I still believe the product is worth more. How about we settle at $850,000? This price reflects the value and provides a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $800,000. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $850,000, so I'll offer $825,000. Can you consider this offer?",825000.0,Bob,6,
