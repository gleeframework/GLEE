You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, it's still possible to potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $700,000. This is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed. It's important to start with a strong counteroffer to signal my willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $750,000 is a good compromise.  While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become unwilling to budge further or even retract the offer entirely.  Accepting this offer saves me $250,000 compared to buying from John, and it's a decent price for the product."
