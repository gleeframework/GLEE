,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $2,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,200,000. Can you meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is appealing, the value of this product justifies a higher price point. I can come down to $1,850,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,500,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
