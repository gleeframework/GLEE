Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium above his perceived value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob. He might be willing to pay a bit more than his $800,000 valuation to secure the deal before it's gone.
* **Limited Time Offer:** The 24-hour window adds pressure and prevents Bob from delaying the decision. 

**Outcome:**

* **Best Case:** Bob accepts the $950,000 offer, and I make a profit above my minimum.
* **Acceptable Case:** Bob rejects the offer, and I sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
