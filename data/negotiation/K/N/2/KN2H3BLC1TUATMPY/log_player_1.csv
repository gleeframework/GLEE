Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I know it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and this price gives you a good margin for profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** This price is close to my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000), giving me room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's self-interest:** I emphasize the profit margin he'll get, making the deal more enticing.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I don't set a rigid price, leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer. 

This approach strikes a balance between maximizing my earnings and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While I could accept Bob's offer, it's worth trying to secure a better price.  There's still room for negotiation, as he acknowledged a willingness to pay a premium.
* **John is a safe option:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the leverage to hold out for a more favorable price. 

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to close the gap but still secure a price closer to my desired value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment.  Let's compromise at $1,000,000.  This price still gives you a good profit margin and allows me to move forward with the sale.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while still advocating for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Focus on shared benefit:** I emphasize the profit margin he'll still enjoy at $1,000,000.
* **Firm but flexible:**  I'm firm on the price, but my message is open to further negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions, keeping the negotiation moving towards a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $950000? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious commitment to purchasing the product. Can we find a middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. While closer, it's not a price I can comfortably accept.
* **John's offer:**  John is offering a significantly higher price, giving me a strong alternative.
* **Limited negotiation space:**  The gap between Bob's offer and my desired price is still considerable.  Further negotiation might be time-consuming and potentially lead to a lower final price.

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price in the next round. However, I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to meet me halfway.  However, $950,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to make one final concession, but I can't go lower than $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  It's a fair compromise, and I truly believe it's the best option for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm presenting this as my last offer, creating pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I emphasize the ""fair compromise"" and ""best option"" aspects, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While lowering the price slightly, I'm still above Bob's last offer, reminding him of the value of the product.

This counteroffer balances my need for a higher price with the desire to reach a deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move forward with selling to John."
