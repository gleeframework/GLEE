Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is simply too far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment.  Let's compromise at $1000000.  This price still gives you a good profit margin and allows me to move forward with the sale.  What do you say?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to meet me halfway.  However, $950000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to make one final concession, but I can't go lower than $1050000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  It's a fair compromise, and I truly believe it's the best option for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to finalize this deal.
