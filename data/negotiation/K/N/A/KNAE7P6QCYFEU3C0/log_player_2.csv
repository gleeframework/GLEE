"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500.  This is a fantastic opportunity to get a valuable product at a great price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have John as a backup option at $10,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting this offer, you can gauge her willingness to negotiate."
