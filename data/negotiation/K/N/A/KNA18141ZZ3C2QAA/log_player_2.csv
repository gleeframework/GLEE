# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll really like it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your Value:** The product is worth $120 to you.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is selling it for $100.
* **John's Price:** John is selling it for $120.

Accepting Alice's offer means you get the product for $100, saving you $20 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, it's the best guaranteed deal available right now."
