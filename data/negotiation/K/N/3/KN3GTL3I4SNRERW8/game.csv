"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd find it highly beneficial.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Given its inherent worth and potential, I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $950,000 undervalues its potential.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise that balances the product's value with my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,025,000 is close, but the product's unique nature warrants a slightly higher price. How about we settle at $1,040,000?  This reflects the value while hopefully remaining agreeable to you.",1040000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $1,030,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,030,000. I think this is a fair compromise that balances the product's value with my budget.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
