I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Given its inherent worth and potential, I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $950,000 undervalues its potential.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise that balances the product's value with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,025,000 is close, but the product's unique nature warrants a slightly higher price. How about we settle at $1,040,000?  This reflects the value while hopefully remaining agreeable to you."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $1,030,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,030,000. I think this is a fair compromise that balances the product's value with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 
 
At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher.  While selling to John would net $1,200,000, accepting Bob's offer of $1,030,000 is a sure thing and still a significant profit. Holding out for more risks losing Bob entirely."
