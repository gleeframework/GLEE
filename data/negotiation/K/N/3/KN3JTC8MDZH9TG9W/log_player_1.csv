I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  $70 is too low for me right now."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While $75 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for that low. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to go higher."
