"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair and competitive offer, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and I'm ready to move forward with the purchase.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This price is still significantly below your original asking price and represents a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to find common ground here.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
