"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair and competitive offer, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,050,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  While I appreciate her willingness to negotiate, I'm not willing to pay more than my budget allows.  It's time to move on and purchase the product from John."
