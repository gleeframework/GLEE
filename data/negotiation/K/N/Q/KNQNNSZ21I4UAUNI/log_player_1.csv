Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I know Bob values the product at $8,000 and my minimum acceptable price is the same, I want to start with a higher offer to explore potential negotiation space.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $10,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, and I can potentially still secure a price higher than my minimum. 
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, I'm secure knowing I can sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price."
