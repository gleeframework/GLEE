Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it's worth $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
 
**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can always negotiate down towards $10,000, knowing I have John as a backup buyer."
