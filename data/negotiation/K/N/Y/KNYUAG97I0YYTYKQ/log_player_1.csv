Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $157.50?  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 157.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  $157.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150 for it.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, but I've already spent three rounds on this negotiation. Given the time constraint and John's willingness to pay my minimum, it's more efficient to sell to John now."
