Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11200}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing $11,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
It's a tough call, but Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting close to my minimum.  I've already made a few concessions and don't want to risk him walking away.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and gets me closer to my desired price than selling to John."
