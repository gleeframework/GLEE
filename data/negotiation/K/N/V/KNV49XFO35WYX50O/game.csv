"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm starting with $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, considering the value of this product.  How about we split the difference at $10,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's value, Alice, but I need to stay within my budget.  Could you do $9,750? That's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $9,750 is still a bit below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $10,125. This would give both of us a good deal.",10125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle at $9,900? I think that's a very fair offer.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,900 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and I think it's worth it for such a valuable product.",10000.0,Alice,7,
