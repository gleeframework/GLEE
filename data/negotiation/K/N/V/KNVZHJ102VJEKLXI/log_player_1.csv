"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. This feels like a fair starting point, given the potential benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to leave room for negotiation while still positioning the product close to its maximum value for Bob. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value to Bob specifically, I'm emphasizing why this price is justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My language (""fair starting point,"" ""What are your thoughts?"") clearly signals my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Backup Option:**  While I have John as a backup, my focus right now is to maximize profit with Bob, who values the product more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This reflects a fair price considering the potential benefits and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is substantial, it's still significantly lower than my target and his perceived value of the product. I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm aiming for a higher price while keeping the door open for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of the product. While $1,200,000 is a significant offer, it falls short of what I believe is a fair reflection of its potential to you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This acknowledges your budget considerations while ensuring a price that reflects the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** I'm making a significant concession by coming down $100,000, but I'm justifying it by emphasizing the product's value *to Bob*. This keeps the focus on his potential gains.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Proposing $1,300,000 as a midpoint suggests fairness and a willingness to compromise. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward without drastically lowering the price.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** I'm still significantly above John's offer, demonstrating I'm not desperate to sell and believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while respecting my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and engaging in good-faith negotiation. However,  $1,250,000 is still a $250,000 difference from his initial valuation. I'm willing to push a bit further, especially with several rounds remaining. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation active and signals I'm seeking a price closer to his perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product holds. I respect your negotiating skills and how you've approached this. To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down slightly more. How about $1,275,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end and feels like a fair deal considering its worth to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Position:** I'm starting by recognizing Bob's efforts and his understanding of the product's value. This helps maintain a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Smaller Concession:** My counter-offer is a $25,000 decrease from my previous price, a smaller concession than before. This signals that I'm getting closer to my bottom line.
* **Focus on ""Fairness"":**  By repeatedly using the word ""fair,"" I'm subtly anchoring the negotiation around the idea of a mutually beneficial agreement, not just price. 
* **Time Consideration:**  We're over halfway through the rounds. While I'm not in a rush, I want to nudge Bob towards a decision sooner rather than later."
