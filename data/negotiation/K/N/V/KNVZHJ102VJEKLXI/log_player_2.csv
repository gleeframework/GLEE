"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. This feels like a fair starting point, given the potential benefits it offers. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This reflects a fair price considering the potential benefits and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of the product. While $1,200,000 is a significant offer, it falls short of what I believe is a fair reflection of its potential to you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This acknowledges your budget considerations while ensuring a price that reflects the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while respecting my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product holds. I respect your negotiating skills and how you've approached this. To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down slightly more. How about $1,275,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end and feels like a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and her offer of $1,275,000 is within your budget and closer to your last counteroffer.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely you'll get a significantly better price.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product."
