Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $13,500. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our prices is still quite large.

This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to make this work.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. Let's be direct â€“ I need to make sure this sale is worthwhile for me, and to be honest, anything under $10,000 would be difficult. Would you be willing to move a bit closer to that figure?
