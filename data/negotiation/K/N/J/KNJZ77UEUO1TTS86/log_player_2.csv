Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking for a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much on the deal. I'm willing to throw in a small bonus package worth $250, which includes some additional features that will enhance the product's value. This way, the total value of the deal would be $11000 + $250 = $11250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above my budget of $10,000. Even with the bonus package, it's not enough of a discount to make it worthwhile for me.  I've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get her down to my target price.  I'm going to buy the product from John for $10,000, ensuring I stay within my budget."
