"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm ready to pay $10000 for the product, which is still a good value for something unique like this. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the unique features and quality of the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12500 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $11000, which is a significant step towards your offer and reflects the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $11750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your current offer is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a middle ground.  I'm ready to pay $11000, which is still a significant value to me for this unique product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're still looking for a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much on the deal. I'm willing to throw in a small bonus package worth $250, which includes some additional features that will enhance the product's value. This way, the total value of the deal would be $11000 + $250 = $11250. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,
