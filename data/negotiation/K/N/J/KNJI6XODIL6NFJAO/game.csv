"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for the product. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're still in the conversation, Bob. I can see you're serious about this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're both getting closer.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this deal.  Let's finalize this and make this happen.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're really close now, Bob. I can see you're making a serious effort to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,200,000, but I'd like to propose a slight concession. I'll throw in some additional perks and support for the product, worth an extra $20,000, if you're willing to meet me at $1,220,000. What do you think?",1220000.0,Alice,7,
