"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your budget constraints.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.
