# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $900,000 is still below the value I've placed on this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price would still be a significant gain for you while allowing me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment.
