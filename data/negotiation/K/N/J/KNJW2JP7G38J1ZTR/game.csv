"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $900,000 is still below the value I've placed on this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price would still be a significant gain for you while allowing me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment.",950000.0,Alice,3,
