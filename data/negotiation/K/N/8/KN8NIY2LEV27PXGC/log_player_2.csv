Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $900,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm to my budget constraint. This approach balances being aggressive with being reasonable.  If she rejects this, I'll be ready to buy from John in the next round."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm going to keep pushing for a better price.  It's possible Alice is getting desperate, and if I'm patient, I might be able to get closer to my target price.  I'm not ready to buy from John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $950,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also not going to overpay.  I'm trying to find the sweet spot where Alice is willing to sell and I can still stay within my budget. If this is rejected, I'll be ready to buy from John in the next round."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is slowly coming down, but I'm not going to settle for anything more than $1 million.  I have to push harder to get her to the price I'm willing to pay. If this offer is rejected, I'll be very close to considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm taking a slightly bigger jump in my counteroffer to $1,000,000. This shows Alice that I'm getting closer to my limit, and I'm hoping this will push her to make a final concession. If she rejects this, I'll be ready to buy from John in the next round."
