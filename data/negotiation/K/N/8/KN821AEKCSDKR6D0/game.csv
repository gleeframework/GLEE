"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Given your valuation of the product at $85, I propose a price of $90. This offer includes the one-year warranty and free shipping. Let's aim for a middle ground that respects both of our positions.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $87.50.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. In light of your proposal, I'd like to suggest a price of $89 for the product. This still includes the one-year warranty and free shipping, and I believe it strikes a good balance between our expectations. Let me know what you think.",89.0,Alice,5,
