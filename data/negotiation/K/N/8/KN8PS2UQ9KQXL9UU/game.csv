"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know if you're interested.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $90? Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
