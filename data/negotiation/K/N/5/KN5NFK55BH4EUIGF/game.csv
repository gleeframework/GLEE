"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true value to you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. To move this forward, I propose a price of $1,350,000. This reflects a willingness to compromise while still recognizing the product's true worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to move forward if we can agree on this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. Let's cut to the chase: I can't sell this product for anything less than $1,300,000. It's a final offer.  I believe it's a fair deal considering the value you'll gain.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with the cost. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $1,280,000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
