"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $15,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $13,500?  That seems like a fair compromise, and we could both be happy with the deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
