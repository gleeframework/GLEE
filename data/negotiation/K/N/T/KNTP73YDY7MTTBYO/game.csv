"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you say?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  This still leaves some room for profit for me, but it's also a good deal for you considering the value of the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $115. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
