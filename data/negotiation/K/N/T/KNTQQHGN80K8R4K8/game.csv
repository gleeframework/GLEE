"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's still a good value for you. Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $920,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm going to stand firm at $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great product at a competitive rate.  Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. However, $930,000 is still not meeting my minimum requirements.  I'm willing to go down to $940,000, which is a significant concession on my part.  This is my final offer â€“ let's make this deal happen.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll be forced to pursue other options.",940000.0,Alice,7,
