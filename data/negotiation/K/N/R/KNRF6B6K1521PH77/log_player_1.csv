Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable opportunity to purchase a high-end product. I'm looking for $10,000 for it. Would you like to make an offer or accept this price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is lower than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($8,000), I should accept the offer.
