Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $90 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $85, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $78? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $78 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $78 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $81?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 81}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $81 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $78 and $81, which would be $79.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John."
