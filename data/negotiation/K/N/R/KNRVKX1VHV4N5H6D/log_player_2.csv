Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your financial constraints. However, $1200000 is significantly below the product's true value, and I'm not comfortable accepting such a low offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1500000. This price still offers you a good deal considering the product's potential, and it allows me to recoup a reasonable amount for its worth. Please consider this offer carefully.
