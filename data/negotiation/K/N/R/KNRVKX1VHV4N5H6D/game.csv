"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Based on its unique qualities and market value, I believe a fair price would be $1800000.  I'm confident this represents a significant value proposition for you. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1800000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your financial constraints. However, $1200000 is significantly below the product's true value, and I'm not comfortable accepting such a low offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1500000. This price still offers you a good deal considering the product's potential, and it allows me to recoup a reasonable amount for its worth. Please consider this offer carefully.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1500000 is still higher than what I can afford at the moment.  To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to offer $1300000. This price represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's potential and my financial constraints.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
