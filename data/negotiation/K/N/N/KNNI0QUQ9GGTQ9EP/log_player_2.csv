You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can definitely do better than $12,000. Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price of $12,000 but still higher than her product's worth of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still being within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only slightly lower than her initial offer.  You can still do better by continuing to negotiate. Rejecting her offer allows you to make another counteroffer, potentially getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your previous offer of $10,000, showing a willingness to negotiate, but still lower than Alice's latest offer of $12,500.  It keeps the negotiation moving forward without risking losing the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to your desired price, you can likely get it lower. Alice has been lowering her price, indicating a willingness to compromise. Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially get a better deal. There's still some room for negotiation before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing that you're willing to meet Alice halfway. It's still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer of $13,000, leaving room for a potential agreement. It's also a reasonable price considering your maximum budget of $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is very close to your previous counteroffer of $11,500.  At this point, continuing to negotiate could be risky. There's a chance Alice might become unwilling to sell, and you might have to buy from John at a much higher price.  While $13,250 is not ideal, it's still a good deal for you, especially considering your maximum budget of $15,000. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product than risk losing the deal and having to pay significantly more."
