{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but it's still lower than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and creates the potential for a deal that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $80. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far below my minimum. It's worth exploring if I can get a better price by counteroffering,  rather than accepting his offer or immediately selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $80 is quite a bit lower than my asking price, I'm willing to compromise. Would you be interested in paying $120 for the product? This is still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $100 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering. I'm not willing to give up the product at such a low price. I will attempt to negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $110 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
