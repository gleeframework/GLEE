"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is way over his budget and he can get the product from John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  He should reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is still more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to me. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a profit, and $8,500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $9,800. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $9,800 is getting closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price. He should continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $9,800 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Let's try $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I need to make a profit, and $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go to $9,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Here's why:

* **Negotiation is Stalling:** Alice is coming down in price, but she's still not within Bob's budget. 
* **Time is Limited:** Bob only has 3 rounds left, and he doesn't want to risk Alice rejecting his next offer and ending up with a worse price.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John's offer of $8,000 is the best price Bob can get, and it's within his budget.

It's a better strategy for Bob to accept John's offer and secure the product at the best possible price rather than continuing a negotiation that might not lead to a successful outcome."
