"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that you could sell it to John for $10,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low.  Remember, this product is worth $10,000 to you, so it's a great deal at this price. We're only in Round 3, so let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and it's closer to your offer, showing my willingness to compromise. Let's try to reach an agreement in this round.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $13,000 is simply not enough for me.  Remember, this product is worth $10,000 to you, and we're already halfway through our negotiations! Let's try to be realistic. I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  This price is still fair, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $14,500 is still too high for me. I'm really looking for a price closer to $13,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This would be a fair compromise and we could finally close the deal. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's getting closer to where I need to be. However, $13,500 still falls short of what this product is truly worth. Remember, it's worth $10,000 to you, and with only a few rounds left, we need to find a solution quickly. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise considering the value and the time constraints.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still too high for me. Let's be realistic. We're running out of time, so I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  $13,750 would be a fair price for both of us.  It's a good compromise, and we can finally close this deal.
