"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $500,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still gives you a great value considering your own assessment.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $650,000? That's a fair offer considering my budget.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $650,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $800,000. This price reflects the value you see in the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
