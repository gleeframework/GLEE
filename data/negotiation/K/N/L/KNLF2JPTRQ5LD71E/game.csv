"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on its worth. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has value, but that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I can see the value of the product is worth more to you than that. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and the value I place on it.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However, $900,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you consider $650,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer to a price you're comfortable with. However, $650,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,
