"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on its worth. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has value, but that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I can see the value of the product is worth more to you than that. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're still quite a way from my ideal price. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However, $900,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you consider $650,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 650000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting closer to a price you're comfortable with. However, $650,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower and that price is already higher than John's offer. It makes more sense to buy from John at this point and secure the $800,000 price."
