Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you a slightly higher price at $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $100, and it's more beneficial for you to secure the product at your target price from John."
