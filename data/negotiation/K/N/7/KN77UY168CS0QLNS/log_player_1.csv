Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product ahead of other interested buyers. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, we want to start high to see if we can exceed that. Offering it at $18,000 aims to capture the maximum potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** This initial high price gives us room to negotiate down if Bob counters. It shows we're confident in the product's value but are open to finding an agreement.
* **Alternative Buyer Guarantee:** We have a safety net with John willing to pay $15,000. This means we don't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob. 
* **Scarcity Tactic:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response.  Remember, any price Bob accepts above $15,000 is a win!"
