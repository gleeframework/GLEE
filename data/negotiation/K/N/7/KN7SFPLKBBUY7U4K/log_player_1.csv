Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product, but I'm sure we can find a middle ground. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,950,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,950,000 is still out of my range.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $1,650,000.  I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and moving towards a reasonable price. While his current offer is still below my ideal, I'm confident I can negotiate him up further in the remaining rounds.  The potential profit from continuing negotiations outweighs accepting John's offer at this time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly recognize the value of this product.  Let's settle this - I'm willing to come down to $1,825,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1825000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,825,000 is still more than I can comfortably pay. Let's meet in the middle at $1,700,000. This would allow me to acquire the product while remaining within my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently increasing his offer, and we're now at $1,700,000. While I could potentially squeeze a bit more, the difference is no longer significant enough to risk losing the deal. Accepting his offer now guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
