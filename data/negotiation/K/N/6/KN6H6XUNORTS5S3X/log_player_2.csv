# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's a rare opportunity, and I'm confident it will be extremely valuable to you.  My starting price is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down, especially since you're a potential buyer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,325,000?  This price still allows me to make a fair profit while giving you a substantial discount from my initial offer.  What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop her price further, especially since she's already made a concession."
