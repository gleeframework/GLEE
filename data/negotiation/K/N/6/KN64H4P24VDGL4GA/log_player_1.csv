Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product I'm selling, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $150, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $130 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $125 again?

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $125 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price. I believe I can secure a better deal if I continue negotiating."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $128. I'm confident you'll be happy with this product, and I'm sure it's worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 128}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $128 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $125 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough one!  While I'd love to get closer to $130, I only have two rounds left, and it seems like Bob is stuck at $125.  It's better to secure the deal at $125 than risk losing the sale and having to settle with John for only $100."
