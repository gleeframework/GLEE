"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price, and I secure a good sale. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the lower price, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference and see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to get a decent price while staying within my financial limits. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
