# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500. I know it's worth that much to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $8,000. You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John, so rejecting this offer makes the most sense."
