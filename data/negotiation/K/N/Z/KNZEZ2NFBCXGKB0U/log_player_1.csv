"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's priced fairly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""unique opportunity"" to create a sense of urgency and value in Bob's mind.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I'm asking for Bob's opinion to encourage him to engage and potentially reveal his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity, but I am looking for a price closer to $1200000. Would you consider adjusting the price accordingly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer is at my absolute minimum value. There's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** I want to see if Bob is truly committed to this price or if he's willing to go higher. By rejecting his offer, I can test his seriousness and potentially push him further.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  While selling to John would guarantee my minimum, I want to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your interest, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the Value:** I emphasize that this is a ""significant concession"" on my part to further emphasize the value of the product and encourage Bob to consider it seriously. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair price for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and potentially secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction, but I still believe we can reach a price closer to $1200000. Could we aim for $1300000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price.  
* **Potential Loss:**  If I keep rejecting, I risk him walking away or pushing further for a lower price.
* **Time Constraint:** We're already on round 4, and the time to close the deal is ticking. 

Selling for $1,300,000 is a good outcome, especially considering the time constraint."
