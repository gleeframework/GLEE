"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference - $95. It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
