"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significantly higher than what you're proposing. I could consider a price of $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see your point, but that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product and what it can do for you. I'm willing to drop to $1,600,000, but I can't go any lower than that.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she's not willing to go much lower. Her ""final offer"" is still far above your maximum budget and John's offer. It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and secure the product from John at a price you know works."
