"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significantly higher than what you're proposing. I could consider a price of $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see your point, but that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product and what it can do for you. I'm willing to drop to $1,600,000, but I can't go any lower than that.  This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
