"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875000. After re-evaluating the market and our previous discussions, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $885000. This is a fair price that takes into account your willingness to negotiate and the value you place on the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's offer of $885,000 is significantly better than John's offer of $1,200,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might walk away or become less willing to negotiate. Accepting the offer secures a good deal for Bob and avoids potential further complications."
