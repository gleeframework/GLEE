"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. I believe it holds great value for you and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1000000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest closer to $800000.  I believe this is still a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget. However, $800000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference.  How about $850000?  This allows for both of us to get closer to our desired price.  What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Bob,4,
