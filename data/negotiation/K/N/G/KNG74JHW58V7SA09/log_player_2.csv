"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. I believe it holds great value for you and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows me to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest closer to $800,000.  I believe this is still a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  The counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate aggressively. However, it's still within a reasonable range, based on my budget and the potential value of the product.
* **Justification:**  The message provides a clear reason for the lower price, focusing on staying within my budget and suggesting a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message ends with an open-ended question, inviting Alice to engage in further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget. However, $800000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still aiming for a lower price if possible.  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe I can get her down further. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to continue pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference.  How about $850,000?  This allows for both of us to get closer to our desired price.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Adjustment:** I'm increasing my offer by $50,000, showing I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a lower price.
* **Fair Split:**  The offer represents a midpoint between my previous offer and Alice's counteroffer, emphasizing a fair compromise.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** The message remains polite and emphasizes a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message ends with an open-ended question, inviting Alice to continue the dialogue."
