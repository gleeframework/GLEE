"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm asking for $20,000.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for this product."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```

I'm starting with a low offer to see how Alice reacts. It's a common negotiation tactic to start low and work my way up."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is significantly below its true value. I could come down to $17,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice came down, her offer is still too high.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more movement from her side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $7,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

I'm increasing my offer significantly, but staying below my maximum budget.  This shows Alice I'm serious but also sets a firm limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  How about $14,000? I'm significantly reducing my asking price to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $14,000 is still too far from my ideal price. I'll counteroffer again, leaving some room for negotiation before I have to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's a fair offer considering the value and my budget."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

I'm offering a price closer to the middle ground but still leaving room for further negotiation. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm serious about staying within a reasonable budget."
