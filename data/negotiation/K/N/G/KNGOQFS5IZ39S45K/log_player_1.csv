Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This gives Bob a good deal, but it's also a significant markup from my minimum value of $120. This allows for some room to negotiate if he counteroffers. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could sell to John for $120, I'm willing to try and get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering with $130. This is still a good deal for Bob, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. It shows that I'm willing to compromise, but not to the point of losing a substantial amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $110 is not ideal, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $120. There's no guarantee that Bob will continue to increase his offer, and it's possible I could get stuck in a back-and-forth that wastes time.  It's better to accept this offer and secure a sale."
