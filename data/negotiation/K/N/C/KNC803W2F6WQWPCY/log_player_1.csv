"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000 for this product.  That's the price I'd need to make this deal work for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob before selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $1,350,000?  This price still gives you a good value for the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still feeling a bit high at $1,350,000. How about we split the difference and go with $1,275,000? This is a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$1,275,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure if I can close the deal with Bob. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $1,275,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,312,500?  This is a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1312500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $1,312,500 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,293,750.  This would allow us both to close this deal fairly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,293,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,293,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,293,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I believe we can still reach an agreement that benefits us both."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,293,750. I'm willing to come down to $1,303,125. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to close this deal.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1303125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,303,125 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,298,437.50, which is almost halfway to your offer. This would be a good compromise, and we can finally close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,298,437.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,298,437.5

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for several rounds, and while he's willing to come up on his price, we haven't been able to reach a point where I'm comfortable selling. I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  I'm going to sell the product to John."
