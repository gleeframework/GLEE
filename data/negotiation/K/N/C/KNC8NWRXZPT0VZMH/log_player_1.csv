Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to see if I can get a better deal.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving me a chance to still get a price above my minimum.
* **Potential Loss vs. Gain:** While Bob could reject the offer, the potential gain from a higher sale price outweighs the risk of losing out on a smaller profit with John."
