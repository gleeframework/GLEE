"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product. However, $110 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $105 is a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $108. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",108.0,Alice,3,
