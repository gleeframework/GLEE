"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is just a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to work with you. I'm happy to drop my price to $140. This would still be a good deal for you, and it's much closer to what I need to make this worth my while. Let me know if this sounds more reasonable.",140.0,Alice,3,
