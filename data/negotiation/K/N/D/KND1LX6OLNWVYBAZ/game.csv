"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $20,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $17,000?",17000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $17,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $18,500?",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $18,500 is closer than before, I still feel that the product is not worth that much to me. Could we possibly agree on $16,500?",16500.0,Bob,4,
