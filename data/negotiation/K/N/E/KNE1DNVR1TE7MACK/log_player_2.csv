"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above his ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially get the price closer to his target of $10,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $11,750? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $11,750 is closer to his target, he's not quite there yet.  He can try to negotiate a bit further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $12,200? It's a small step closer to your target, and I'm hoping it will be a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last offer of $12,200 is still higher than Bob's ideal price of $10,000, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will bring the price down to a level he's comfortable with.  To ensure he gets the product for his desired price, Bob should opt to buy from John."
