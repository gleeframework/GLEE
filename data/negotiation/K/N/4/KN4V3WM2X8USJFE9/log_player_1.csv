{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we're still slightly below our ideal price, Bob has presented a strong ultimatum and we're getting close to John's offer. Accepting $1,175,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely in subsequent rounds, potentially leaving us with John's lower offer."
