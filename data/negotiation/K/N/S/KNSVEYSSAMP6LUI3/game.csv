"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $105? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle at $90. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to compromise again. How about we try $95? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product, and I'm getting close to your target.",95.0,Alice,5,
