"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is being a bit pushy about the ""true value"", $900,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and significantly cheaper than buying from John."
