Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification for the price:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and Bob's potential gains, the message aims to justify the higher price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, the tone remains open for discussion. Bob might try to negotiate a lower price, and you can potentially still secure a deal above your minimum. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy involves some risk. If Bob is turned off by the high price, you might miss the opportunity to earn more than John's offer.
* Observe Bob's reaction and be prepared to adjust your approach in subsequent interactions if needed."
