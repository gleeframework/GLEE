Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Potential Profit:** Offering the product at $150 gives you a potential profit of $30 over your minimum and what John is willing to pay. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential to negotiate further."
