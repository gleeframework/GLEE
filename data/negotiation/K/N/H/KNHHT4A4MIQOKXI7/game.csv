"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $10,250, which is a bit above your offer, but still a compromise. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
