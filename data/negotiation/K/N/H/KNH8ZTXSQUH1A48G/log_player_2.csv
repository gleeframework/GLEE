"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that's fair to both of us.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something that's worth a lot to you.  I'm asking for $12,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's a significant markup from Alice's perceived value.  There's a chance you could get a better price by negotiating or seeing if she lowers her offer.  You can always fall back on buying from John for $15,000."
