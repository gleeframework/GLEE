Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. I am willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value of this product.  How about $1,600,000? It's a good middle ground that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,550,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's also higher than what I could get from John right now.  Since we're already in the 4th round, I don't want to risk going further and potentially ending up with a worse offer or losing time.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
