You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price.  There are 9 rounds left, so I have time to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range. This is a strong opening move that will likely prompt Alice to negotiate further. My goal is to push for a price closer to my ideal range while keeping the negotiation dynamic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for my budget. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm going to make another counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my target price while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still staying within a price range that's comfortable for me.  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and I hope this offer will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price and the rounds are getting short.  This is a good deal, as I'm saving a significant amount compared to buying from John.  With only 5 rounds left, it's better to accept and secure the purchase."
