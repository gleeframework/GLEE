"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $10,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
