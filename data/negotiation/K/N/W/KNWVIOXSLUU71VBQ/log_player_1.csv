"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is a significant markup from my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good starting point.  I'm also trying to build rapport by emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $8,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial price, and I know he's willing to pay more. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to offer $8,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is a better offer than Bob's previous one, it's still below my desired price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get closer to $9,000. I'll reject his offer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
