Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. I think you'll agree it's a fair price for what you're getting."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product is worth more than Bob might think. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While Alice has John as a backup, she doesn't want to reveal this to Bob.  Knowing she has a guaranteed sale could weaken her negotiating position. 
* **Direct and Confident:** The tone is polite but firm, showing Alice is serious about the sale. 

By starting at $20,000, Alice gives herself the best chance to secure a higher profit, while still staying within a reasonable range of Bob's perceived value."
