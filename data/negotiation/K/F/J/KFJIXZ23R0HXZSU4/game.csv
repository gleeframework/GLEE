"I appreciate you offering the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I also have to consider my own value for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $16,000 for it. Can we discuss a price of $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $16,000 is still higher than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which would be a good deal for both of us. How does that sound?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. Can we meet at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to get a good price, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",13000.0,Bob,6,
