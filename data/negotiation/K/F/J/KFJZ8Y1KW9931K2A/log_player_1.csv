Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He'll only accept offers below this price.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** The prices between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 represent potential deals where both you and Bob profit.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA to maximize your profit. However, starting too high risks offending Bob and losing the deal.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe its value far exceeds the asking price. Are you interested in discussing a purchase at $1,450,000?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,450,000 is a strong starting point, giving you room to negotiate while still being significantly above your minimum.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The language implies this is a starting point for a conversation, not a take-it-or-leave-it offer. 
* **Value Emphasis:** By highlighting the product's unique value, you're subtly justifying the high price.

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening move. Be prepared to negotiate. If Bob outright rejects the offer, you might need to come down in price, but always keep your $1,500,000 safety net in mind!"
