Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a higher price. I'm also trying to build a rapport by emphasizing the product's value and showing interest in Bob as a potential buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $7,500 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $8,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 for this exceptional product. This price still reflects its high quality and value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $8,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
