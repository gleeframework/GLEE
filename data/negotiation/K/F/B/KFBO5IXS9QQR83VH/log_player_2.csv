Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still potentially get a better price by negotiating further. He knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and he's already offered $850,000, so there's still room for a compromise."

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he might be able to get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate, it's likely that Alice will not go any lower.  Buying from Alice for $900,000 is a better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000."
