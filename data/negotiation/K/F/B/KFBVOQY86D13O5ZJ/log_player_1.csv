Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Your Goal:** Maximize profit, aiming for a price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer. This allows you to:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer significantly above Bob's perceived value to give yourself room to negotiate down.
2. **Justify Value:**  Don't just state a price.  Highlight the aspects of the product that make it valuable, even above Bob's initial assessment.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially valuing it at $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see. I'm open to discussing this further and demonstrating how this product can exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,400,000 gives you negotiating room while staying below your guaranteed price.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on ""unique features"" and ""potential,"" subtly suggesting the product might be worth more than Bob currently thinks.
* **Open to Discussion:** You show willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more comfortable counter-offering.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening move. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and be ready to adjust your price slightly downward if necessary. However, never go below your $1,500,000 guarantee."
