"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity with significant potential. I'm starting with a price of $1000000, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial deal.  What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $750000 is a good starting point, it's unfortunately below the value I need to receive. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $800000?  This seems like a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while still being within my budget. Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
