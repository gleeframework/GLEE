Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its potential benefits to you."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making him more likely to accept a higher price.
* **Alternative Option:**  It's important to remember Alice has a fallback option (John at $8,000), so aiming high with Bob makes sense."
