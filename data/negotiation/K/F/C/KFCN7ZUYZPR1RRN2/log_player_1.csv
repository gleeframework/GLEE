"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a significantly high offer to provide room for negotiation while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility while leaving space to lower the price in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still considerably lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter-offer to try and close the gap. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a last resort at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I appreciate your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,800,000 is significantly below its true value. Could we meet in the middle at $2,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Appreciate:** I want to maintain a positive negotiation environment by acknowledging Bob's offer and appreciating his perspective.
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating that my price is based on the product's inherent value, signaling I'm not willing to drastically drop the price.
* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a counter-offer that meets Bob halfway between his offer and my previous price. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, indicating a genuine interest in the product. However, $1,900,000 is still a significant gap from my $2,100,000 counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more movement from his side before considering accepting. I'm confident I can still reach a better deal than selling to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  It seems we both see the value in this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $2,050,000. This feels like a fair offer considering its potential worth."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Building Rapport:** I'm continuing to emphasize a collaborative approach by acknowledging our shared understanding of the product's value.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this round ($50,000) to signal that I'm reaching the limit of my flexibility. 
* **Justification:** The message reinforces that my offer is driven by the product's inherent worth and is a fair compromise.
* **Time Constraint:** As we progress through the rounds, I need to apply a bit more pressure to reach a deal sooner rather than later, considering my alternative option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $2,050,000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to pay $1,950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating strategically with incremental increases, but $1,950,000 is still too far from my target.  While I want to be flexible, I also need to signal that I'm firm on my valuation. I believe there's a chance to negotiate a slightly better deal, and I'm willing to risk one more round.  The difference between his offer and John's offer is becoming less significant, but I'm not ready to walk away just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your negotiation style, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant compromise from my original price, reflecting my desire to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Respect and Clarity:** I'm acknowledging Bob's approach and making it clear that this is my final offer to add a sense of urgency.
* **Final Compromise:** $2,000,000 represents a substantial compromise on my part, but it's still above my absolute bottom line (John's offer). 
* **Closing Focus:**  The message emphasizes my desire to finalize the deal, encouraging Bob to seriously consider this offer. 
* **Time Consideration:** With only a few rounds remaining, I need to push for a decision and be prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob has returned to his previous offer of $1,900,000, indicating that he's unlikely to move significantly closer to my $2,000,000 bottom line.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of getting a lower offer or no deal at all. The difference between his offer and John's guaranteed offer is no longer worth the risk.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a sure sale at my absolute minimum acceptable price, providing certainty and immediate closure.

It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
