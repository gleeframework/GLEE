"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is quite a bit higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10000 at this time.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $14000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000.  I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $12000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $13500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",13500.0,Alice,5,
