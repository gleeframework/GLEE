Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That said, the price you're suggesting is a bit high for my budget. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be a fair starting point. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but $1,250,000 is pushing my absolute limit.  To be completely transparent, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $1,000,000.  However, I prefer to work with you and am willing to offer $1,050,000 to seal the deal today.  This is my final offer.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While ideally, I'd want closer to my $1,200,000 valuation, Bob has signaled this is his best offer. Accepting $1,050,000 secures a significant profit compared to his initial offers and avoids the risk of him walking away. It's a strong deal given the circumstances."
