"Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects the true value and potential for a successful partnership.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That said, the price you're suggesting is a bit high for my budget. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be a fair starting point. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its value.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a great deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but $1,250,000 is pushing my absolute limit.  To be completely transparent, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $1,000,000.  However, I prefer to work with you and am willing to offer $1,050,000 to seal the deal today.  This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
