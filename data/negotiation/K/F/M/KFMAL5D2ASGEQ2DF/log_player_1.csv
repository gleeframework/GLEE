Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This gives him some room to negotiate while still leaving me a significant profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not starting at the highest possible price because I want to leave room for counteroffers. This helps keep Bob engaged and allows for a smoother negotiation process.
* **John as a safety net:**  The knowledge that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me a fallback position if negotiations with Bob fail.

This initial offer strikes a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping the negotiations open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my desired profit margin and still leaves Bob with a substantial profit.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm confident that I can get a higher price, as Bob clearly values the product at more than $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is key:** Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a more favorable price.

**Next steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and counter:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still aiming for a higher price.  $1,300,000 is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While moving closer, I'm not accepting his offer yet. This keeps the pressure on Bob to raise his offer or risk losing the deal.
* **Balancing profit and progress:**  This counteroffer balances my desire for a good profit with the need to keep the negotiations moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While closer to my bottom line, $1,150,000 is still significantly below the value I place on the product and what I know Bob is willing to pay.
* **Risk of selling too low:**  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss of potential profit, especially considering Bob's earlier willingness to pay more.
* **Negotiation continues:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially secure a more profitable deal. 

**Next steps:**  I will counter Bob's offer again, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  I'm making a final concession, moving even closer to Bob's offer.  $1,250,000 represents a compromise that acknowledges Bob's reluctance to go higher but still leaves me with a decent profit.
* **Last chance offer:** This is intended to be my final counteroffer. If Bob rejects this, I'm prepared to move on and sell to John. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:** I'm taking a calculated risk by lowering my price. However, I believe this is the best way to close the deal and secure a sale while maximizing my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation stalemate:**  Bob has repeatedly rejected my offers, indicating he's unwilling to go any higher.  This suggests that we've reached an impasse, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significant increase in price.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of further concessions, potentially dropping the price even lower than $1,100,000.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,000,000, which is more than Bob's final offer.  While it's not ideal, it's a secure and reasonable outcome.

**Final decision:** Given the circumstances, selling to John is the most sensible decision, ensuring a safe and profitable transaction."
