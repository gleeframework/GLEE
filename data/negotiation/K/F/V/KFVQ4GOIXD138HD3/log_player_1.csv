"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me ($8,000). I believe this will give Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially earn more than my minimum.  I'm also being positive and optimistic to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm rejecting his offer and will try to negotiate a better price in the next round.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet because I think I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest price I can offer. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $8,500. This is still above my minimum of $8,000, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm also reiterating the value of the product and emphasizing that this is a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price. I'm getting closer to being ready to buy.  How about $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,250 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $7,750?  I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable, and this price reflects that."", ""product_price"": 7750}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $7,750. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I'm still confident in the value of the product and believe this price is fair to both of us. I'm also framing the offer as a way for Bob to get a great deal on a valuable product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we are getting close. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,500 is finally above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While it's not ideal, it's the best offer I've received so far. I'm accepting his offer to avoid risking further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price."
