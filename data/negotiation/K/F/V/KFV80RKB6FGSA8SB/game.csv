"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  I think that's fair, and it would allow us to both walk away happy.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,400 as a final offer.  It's a fair price, and I think it reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $9,400, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $9,200. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",9200.0,Bob,6,
