Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it.  I'm willing to let it go for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling pressured.
* **It's lower than your minimum price:** This leaves you room to drop the price if needed. 
* **It's a clear message:**  It's clear what you want to sell the product for. 

Remember,  you can always adjust the price depending on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than your minimum price of $150.  
* **You have a better option:**  You can sell the product to John for $150, which is a much better deal for you. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired range, giving Bob another chance to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell for $145.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This offer is halfway between your previous offer ($175) and Bob's offer ($120). 
* **A reasonable compromise:**  It demonstrates that you are willing to negotiate but also that you value your product.
* **Positive messaging:** The message is friendly and encouraging, making Bob feel like you are still interested in a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below your minimum price of $150.
* **John offers a better deal:**  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum price. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing John as a buyer and potentially ending up with a lower price than John's offer.  

Selling to John ensures you get the best possible price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
