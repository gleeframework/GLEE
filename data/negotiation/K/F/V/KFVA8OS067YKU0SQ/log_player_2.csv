"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale that I think you'll be interested in! It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $150.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth at least $120 to her, so it's likely worth more than $120 to me. I can get it for $120 from John, so I'll reject Alice's offer.
