"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $1,400,000 is still too low for me, and I believe I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, I'm still not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,450,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value the product will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $1,450,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I believe I can push for a bit more, especially since John is a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000."

Round 6

I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.

I'm going to sell the product to John.  The negotiations with Bob have stalled, and we're getting close to the end of the rounds.  John's offer is a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
