Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is higher than $80, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is still above your minimum of $120, giving you a profit.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By starting with a price slightly above your minimum, you signal to Bob that you're open to discussion. 

If Bob rejects this offer, you can assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or counter with a different price.  You can also always choose to walk away and sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $85. I hope this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $120. It's worth trying to get closer to my goal by making a counteroffer.  I'll see if I can bridge the gap with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at that price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
