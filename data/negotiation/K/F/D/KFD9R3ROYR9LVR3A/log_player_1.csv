Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget for this purchase is significantly lower.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it.  This price is fair considering my needs and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the worth of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my initial offer, but $1,000,000 is the absolute maximum I can offer. This would still be a good deal for you, and I'm confident it reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving in the right direction, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a result significantly better than John's offer. Accepting $1,000,000 is a $500,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,500,000. It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed sale."
