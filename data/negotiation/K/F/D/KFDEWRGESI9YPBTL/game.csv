"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I think you'll find it's still a great deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $10,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,
