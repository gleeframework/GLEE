"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm interested in the product but can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering my opportunity cost of acquiring the product elsewhere.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $800000 is simply too low. The potential this product offers is significant, and I believe a price closer to $1200000 would be fair for both of us. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a compelling investment opportunity.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1200000, but I'm still not there.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's find a way to make this deal work for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand we're getting close. $950000 is a significant offer, but it's still a bit short of what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975000.  This is a fair price considering the potential this product holds for your business, and it allows us to finalize this deal. Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
