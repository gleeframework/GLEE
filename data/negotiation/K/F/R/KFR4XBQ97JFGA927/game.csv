"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, worth a significant $1,500,000 to you. I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. To start, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,700,000, a fair price considering its value. Let's discuss this further.",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to buy it for $1,200,000. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than the value this product will bring to your business.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to lower my price to $1,550,000.  This gives you a good deal and ensures a smooth transaction.  What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but $1,375,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,450,000, which reflects the significant value this product brings to your business. This price is fair for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I can see you're serious about finding a fair price.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,412,500?  That shows movement on both sides.",1412500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,412,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1,425,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best price we can both agree on. Let's close this deal.",1425000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is getting down to the wire!  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,406,250.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  Let me know if this works for you.",1406250.0,Bob,8,
