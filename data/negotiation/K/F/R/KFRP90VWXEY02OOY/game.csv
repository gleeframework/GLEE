"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This price is still above your value for the product and allows for a decent profit for you. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort we've put into developing it. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit higher than my target price. How about $1,150,000? This offers a substantial profit for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the effort we've put into developing it. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
