"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, there's still potential to save money. I can counteroffer and see if I can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort we've put into developing it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit higher than my target price. How about $1,150,000? This offers a substantial profit for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the effort we've put into developing it. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,250,000 is within my budget and only slightly more than my initial counteroffer.  While I'd prefer a lower price, I'm running the risk of losing this deal and having to pay John $1,500,000. It's a good deal for both of us."
