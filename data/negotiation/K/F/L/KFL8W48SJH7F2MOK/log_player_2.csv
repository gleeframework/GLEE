Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and sets a lower limit for the price range.  We'll see if she's willing to negotiate from there."

Alice's offer is still too high.  We're getting closer to a deal, but I'm going to continue trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting tough, and we're nearing the end of our rounds.  While I'd like to get a better price from Alice, it's likely we won't get below $350,000.  To avoid the risk of not reaching a deal and to ensure I get the product, I'm going to buy it from John for $800,000.  It's not ideal, but it's the most secure option at this point."
