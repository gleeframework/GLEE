"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This offer takes into account the mutual interests of both parties and aims to ensure a fair transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Since Bob's maximum value is $10,000, rejecting and counter-offering allows Bob to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate the gesture. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I am willing to consider a price of $9,200 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,200 is within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John. While there is still some room for negotiation, the risk of further negotiation is that Alice could reject Bob's offer again, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice."
