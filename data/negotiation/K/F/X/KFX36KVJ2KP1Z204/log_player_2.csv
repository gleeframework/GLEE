"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate. Alice's initial offer is way above my budget.  It's worth seeing if she'll come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100, but not a penny more."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:** I'm starting with a low offer ($100) to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This anchors the negotiation lower and leaves room for me to increase my offer if needed.
* **Firm Limit:**  I've clearly stated my maximum price, signaling that anything above $100 is a no-go. 
* **John as Backup:**  I'm keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $120. This gives me leverage and prevents me from feeling pressured to accept a bad deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $100 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $140 is closer to my budget, but it's still $20 more than I want to spend, and $20 more than I need to spend. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move down from $180 to $140 suggests she's open to negotiation.  I'll try to bring her down further. 
* **John Option:**  My ability to buy from John at any time keeps me from feeling pressured to accept a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still more than I had in mind.  I could go up to $110, but that's my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still staying well below her offer to signal I'm looking for a significant discount.
* **Firm Limit (Again):** I'm reiterating that $110 is my maximum budget. This reinforces my position and hopefully encourages Alice to make a more substantial move.
* **Time Pressure:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds. My willingness to increase my offer slightly also applies a bit of time pressure, potentially motivating Alice to settle rather than risk me walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make another concession, Bob. But I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of a price of $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Close, But Not There:**  Alice is slowly coming down, but $130 is still a $10 premium over what John is offering. 
* **Testing the Waters:** I need to see if Alice will come down further. It's worth risking another round of negotiation to potentially save that extra $10.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm still comfortable walking away from the negotiation and going with John if needed.  This keeps me from making a decision based on frustration or impatience."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer!  I can do $115, but that's really pushing my budget.  It's a fair offer, and I think it's time we make a deal."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase, Sense of Urgency:** I'm increasing my offer by a smaller increment this time ($5), but I'm also adding language to signal that I'm nearing my limit and I want to close the deal.
* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  This counteroffer is almost directly in the middle of our last two positions ($110 and $130).  It suggests a spirit of compromise but still keeps me below my $120 walk-away point.
* **Limited Rounds Remain:**  With fewer rounds left, I need to apply a bit more pressure for Alice to accept or counter with a more appealing offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see you're serious about making a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Alice has consistently reduced her offer in smaller increments.  Her latest offer of $125 is only $5 away from my previous counteroffer, and she's stated it's ""as low as she can go."" 
* **John's Price is Better:**  It's no longer worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. I can get the product for $120 from John, which is a guaranteed $5 savings over Alice's best offer. 
* **No More Time to Waste:**  With only a few rounds left, I'd rather secure the product from John than risk Alice not coming down further."
