Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This is a relatively high offer, considering Bob values the product at $8,000. However, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  He's likely to counteroffer, giving you information about his willingness to negotiate.
* **Leave room for bargaining:** You can adjust your price based on his counteroffer, potentially securing a higher price than you initially offered.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  You can still walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if Bob's counteroffers don't meet your expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $10,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $12,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but shows I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage him to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Even though I've lowered my price twice already, it's clear that Bob is unwilling to come close to my desired price point.  To maximize my earnings, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
