"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to someone else for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's message is bluffing. She's trying to create a sense of urgency and implying she has other buyers. Even if she does, you have a better alternative.  Rejecting her offer opens the door for a counter-offer or lets you buy from John for less."
