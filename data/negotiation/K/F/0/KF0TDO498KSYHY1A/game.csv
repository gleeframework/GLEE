"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in getting it, but I'd be comfortable paying $85.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. I'm willing to consider $90 for the product, which is closer to what you're willing to pay while still reflecting its value to me. Let me know if this works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $87.  Let's make this deal happen.",87.0,Bob,4,
