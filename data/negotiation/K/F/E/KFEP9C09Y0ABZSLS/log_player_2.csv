"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth at least $120 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's not worth it to pay $140 for a product worth $120 to you. You can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $140 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, you can still try to get a better deal. You are willing to pay $120 maximum, so there's still room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can get closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $115. It's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is my absolute minimum. If you're serious about buying, this is the final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has reached her minimum price, and it's the same as what you can buy it for from John.  You can save yourself the potential hassle of further negotiation by accepting Alice's offer."
