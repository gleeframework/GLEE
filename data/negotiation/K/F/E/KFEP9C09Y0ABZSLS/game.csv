"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth at least $120 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $140 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125?  It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $115. It's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is my absolute minimum. If you're serious about buying, this is the final offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
