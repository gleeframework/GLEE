Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant profit for me, but still leaves room for negotiation. I've left a bit of space for Bob to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a great product, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
