Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Value Justification:** While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the message implies the product is worth a significant amount, justifying the higher price. 

This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob will reject the offer, but the potential for a 50% profit increase makes it a risk worth taking."
