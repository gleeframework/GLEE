,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product for $1100000. It's a fair price considering its value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. It's a more competitive price point for the market.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a competitive price point, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm offering the product for $1050000. This is as low as I can go without losing money.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but that's as high as I can go.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $990000, but that's as low as I can go without losing money. It's a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value.",990000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already met you at $990000 and you rejected it. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to hold firm at $990000, but I'm open to discussing other terms if you're interested. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",990000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $990000. I'm willing to meet you at $975000, but that's my final offer. If I don't get a deal at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1500000.",975000.0,Bob,10,
