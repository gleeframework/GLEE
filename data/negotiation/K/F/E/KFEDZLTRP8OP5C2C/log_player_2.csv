You can do better than $9,000.  You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate."

I'm offering Alice $8,500. This is a fair price that's still above her value for the product, but significantly lower than her initial offer."

Alice's offer is still too high, but closer to what I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again to try and get closer to my target price."

I'm offering Alice $8,750. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but still below her latest offer. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince her to sell."

Alice is clearly not willing to budge much. I've made several counteroffers, and she's consistently increasing her price. At this point, it's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $10,000. It's not ideal, but it's within my budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
