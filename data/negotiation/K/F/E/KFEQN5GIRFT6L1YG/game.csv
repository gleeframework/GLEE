"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. It's a rare opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and exclusivity. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. Considering the value I'm placing on this product, I'm willing to offer $500000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the unique qualities of this item while remaining within my financial limits. Let me know your thoughts.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a significant reduction from my initial price, but I'm still not convinced it's a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is my final compromise, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
