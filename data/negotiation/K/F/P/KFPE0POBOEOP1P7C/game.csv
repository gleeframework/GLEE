"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to reach a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
