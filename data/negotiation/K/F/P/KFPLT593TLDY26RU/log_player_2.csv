I'm open to negotiating and finding a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your willingness to save and the product's actual worth. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's still a significant saving for me compared to buying from John, and it seems like she's willing to meet me halfway. Let's take the deal."
