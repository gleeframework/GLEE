{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer, we're still significantly above his perceived value. It's unlikely he'll go much higher. We need to signal we're firm but willing to negotiate slightly to see if we can close the gap."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. I'm willing to make one more significant move to seal this deal. My final offer is $1,360,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price for a product of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 1360000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Deadline Pressure:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation.  Creating a sense of urgency can push Bob to act.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** This signals seriousness and limits further back-and-forth.
* **Small Concession:** We're still above his last offer but showing a willingness to compromise.

Now, Bob either meets us closer to our price, we hold firm at $1,360,000, or we walk away and take John's offer if Bob's counter is too low."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob is incrementing his offers in smaller amounts, indicating he's unlikely to reach our desired price range.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks leaving money on the table. John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 becomes increasingly attractive compared to the slow progress with Bob.
* **Time Value of Money:**  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  We can close with John and re-deploy our resources."
