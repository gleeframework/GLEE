"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's unique qualities, $900000 is a bit steep for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $500000, but I need to understand the value proposition better to justify a higher price.  What are your thoughts?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and rarity. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750000 is still above what I'm comfortable with.  Considering the information I have, I'm confident that $600000 is a fair price for this product.  I'm ready to close the deal at that price, but I need to understand more about its true value to justify a higher number.  Let's find a middle ground.",600000.0,Bob,4,

I'm willing to sell it to you for $700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $700000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $650000,  which I believe reflects a fair price for the product based on the information I have.  To move forward, I need a better understanding of the product's value to justify going any higher.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",650000.0,Bob,6,
