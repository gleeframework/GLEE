It's always worth trying to negotiate, even if it's just a little bit. Since you have a backup option, you can afford to be a bit more aggressive in your negotiations."

It's still worth trying to negotiate down further. While Alice has come down a bit, you still have room to bargain and save some money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. It's a slight increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and you are now only $500 away from your counteroffer. At this point, it's likely that continuing to negotiate will just take more time and may not result in a much lower price.  It's worth accepting Alice's offer and saving $1,500 compared to buying from John."
