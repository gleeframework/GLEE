{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $130 is above your $100 minimum, so you're already getting a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $150, so there's room for negotiation if he wants a lower price.
* **It's a fair offer:** $130 is a good compromise between your minimum and Bob's maximum. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $110 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I want to get for the product.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. It's still a great deal for you, considering you value it at $150, and it's a fair price for me. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
