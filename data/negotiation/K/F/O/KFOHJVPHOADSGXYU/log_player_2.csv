Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get. How about we meet in the middle at $170? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll find great value in it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170

$170 is still too high. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my limit."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $170 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $140, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 140}
