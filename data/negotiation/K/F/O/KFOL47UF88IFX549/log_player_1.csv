Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Being friendly:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage with the offer.
* **Leaving room for counter-offers:**  By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm inviting Bob to counteroffer, which could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Plan B:** I'm aware that Bob could reject my offer, so I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I won't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $100. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still good:** While $100 is lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  
* **Opportunity to gain more:**  I believe I can still get a better price. Bob is clearly interested, so there's potential for a mutually agreeable price somewhere between $100 and my initial offer of $120. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my preferred price, potentially getting closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I'm definitely willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That would be fair to both of us. "", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Building on previous offer:** My counteroffer is a compromise that addresses Bob's concerns while still being close to my desired price.
* **Highlighting the fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""split the difference"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and make him more receptive.
* **Maintaining momentum:** By being flexible and open to negotiation, I'm encouraging Bob to continue the dialogue and potentially reach a deal."
