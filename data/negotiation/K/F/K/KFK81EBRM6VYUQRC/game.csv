"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm asking for $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. Can you consider this offer?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $8,750 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $8,900.  That's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price.",8900.0,Alice,5,
