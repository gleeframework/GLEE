"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than the product's value to Bob, but not exorbitantly so.  This gives him room to negotiate, but also shows that I'm confident in the product's worth.  Let's see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000, especially since I have another buyer willing to pay that price.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation. Hopefully, he'll see that I'm serious about getting a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000, and I have another buyer ready to pay that. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  It's getting risky to keep rejecting Bob's offers, but I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to get him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time and Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While I wanted to get a higher price, securing $1,500,000 is still a good outcome."
