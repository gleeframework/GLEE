"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price above my $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. Starting low increases the chances of getting a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is quite low for what I can offer. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but she's still above my maximum price. I know I can get it for $8,000 from John, so I'll hold firm for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate upward, but I'm staying firm below my $8,000 limit. It gives Alice room to counter, potentially settling around a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $8,000? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met my maximum price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John, as I won't get a better deal."
