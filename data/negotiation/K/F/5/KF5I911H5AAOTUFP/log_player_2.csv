"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better deal than John's $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original $11,500 offer to $11,000. This is a better deal than John's $12,000 offer and is within Bob's budget. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject his offer and ultimately he might end up paying $12,000 to John.  Accepting Alice's offer at $11,000 is a good compromise and saves Bob $1,000."
