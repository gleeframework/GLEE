"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly. I'm prepared to negotiate, but I'm also aware of John's guaranteed $800,000 offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and it's a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $700,000. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to offer $850,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but still above John's guaranteed price.  I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $650,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I've been willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept a price that's so low.  It's time to take John's guaranteed offer.  I can at least secure the minimum amount I'm comfortable with."
