"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point of $10,000. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, and there's a chance you can get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, but still above your limit. You have 7 rounds remaining, and there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to counter again and potentially get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a little higher than I'm aiming for. Given its value to me, I'm confident that $11,000 is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $12000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer it to you for $12200. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my desired price point. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll be able to get a lower price. It's risky to continue negotiating, as the risk of not reaching an agreement increases with each round. Given that John is willing to sell the product for my maximum price of $10,000, it's a safer option to buy from him and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
