Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while aiming for a significantly higher profit margin.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value without revealing your bottom line, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to adjust your price slightly downward if Bob negotiates. However, don't go below $10,000, as you can always sell to John at that price."
