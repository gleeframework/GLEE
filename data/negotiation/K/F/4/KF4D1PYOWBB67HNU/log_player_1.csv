Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $800,000 is significantly lower than my starting price and I believe I can get a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's offer. This should encourage continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still going to reject this offer.  I think I can push Bob a little higher with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's still a significant profit compared to selling to John.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $950,000 is a good price, I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000.  It seems like Bob is not willing to go higher, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price."
