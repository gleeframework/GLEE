**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:**  $1,150,000
* **Your maximum price:** $1,200,000
* **John's price:** $1,200,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially try to negotiate with Alice further, the risk of her rejecting a lower offer and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
