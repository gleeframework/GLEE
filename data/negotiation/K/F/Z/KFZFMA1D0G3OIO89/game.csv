"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm offering the product to you for $14,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could you consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",13000.0,Alice,5,
