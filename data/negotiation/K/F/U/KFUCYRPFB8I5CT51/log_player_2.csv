It's not worth buying the product from Alice at $120 when you can get it from John for $100.  It's better to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a better price with Alice."

While $110 is closer to my target, it's still higher than John's offer. I'll continue to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

I'm offering Alice's minimum price, which is the same as John's offer. If she accepts, it's a win for me. If she rejects, I'll have to decide whether to accept her next offer or go with John."
