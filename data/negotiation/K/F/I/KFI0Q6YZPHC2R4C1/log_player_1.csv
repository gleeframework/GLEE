Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $120, which reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $120 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($150 - $80 = $70) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($150 - $120 = $30).
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup ensures you won't be forced to accept anything below your minimum.

This strategy balances your desire for profit with a price that's likely to be attractive to Bob."
