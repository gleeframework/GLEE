Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** While the price is above Bob's perceived value ($80), it's not astronomically higher. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium depending on the product's nature and his need for it."
