"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $110, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $110 is lower than buying from John, you can still try to get a better price. By rejecting her initial offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price, closer to Alice's perceived value of $80."
