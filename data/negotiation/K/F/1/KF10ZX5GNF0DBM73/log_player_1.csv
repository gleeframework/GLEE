Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm starting with an offer of $115. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum desired price of $100.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a bit more than my minimum, but I'm also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
