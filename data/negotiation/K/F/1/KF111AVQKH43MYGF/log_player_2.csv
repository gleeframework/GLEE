{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting too close to my maximum budget.  Alice seems unwilling to budge much further, and with only a few rounds left, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiations.  I'm going to buy the product from John for $10,000.  While it's not the ideal price, it's within my budget and guarantees I'll get the product."
