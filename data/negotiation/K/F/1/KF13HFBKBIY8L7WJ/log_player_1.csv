"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm going to see how he reacts to a significantly higher price. If he accepts, great! If not, we can negotiate downwards. I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the price doesn't meet my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's a good sign that he's interested. I'm going to counter with a lower price, but still above my minimum, to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering the price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price.  If he rejects again, I'll consider selling to John, but I'm still optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is stuck at $1,200,000. I'm going to counter again and see if I can get him to move closer to my desired price. I'm still hopeful we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm dropping the price again, but it's still a decent profit for me. This is a good compromise and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While it's not my ideal price, Bob's offer is finally above my minimum of $1,000,000.  With only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on this deal. I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
