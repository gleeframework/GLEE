Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it just below John's price might entice Bob.
* **Urgency:** By implying you have another buyer, Bob might be more likely to act quickly and accept a price he might otherwise negotiate down further. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slightly):**  While unlikely, leaving a tiny bit of wiggle room could give Bob a sense of getting a deal if he tries to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable losing the sale to Bob if he rejects the offer. There's always a risk he'll walk away, and she'll get the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
