"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product and the value you've expressed it has for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
