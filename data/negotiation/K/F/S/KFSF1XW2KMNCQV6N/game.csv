"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do it for $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $7,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm open to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would give us both a fair price. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,5,
