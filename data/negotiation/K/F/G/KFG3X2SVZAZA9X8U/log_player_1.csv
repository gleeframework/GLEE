"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $110, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive and encouraging tone in my message can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not setting a firm price, but rather leaving the door open for discussion. 
* **Knowing John's Offer:** I have John's offer of $120 in mind, so I'm comfortable starting high and seeing if I can get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can offer you $95 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value of $120, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $110. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not ready to accept such a low offer.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer knowing I have John's guaranteed offer of $120 as a fallback option. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you coming back to me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $105, but that's as low as I can go right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by reducing my price from $110 to $105. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** $105 is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, suggesting a potential meeting point.
* **Firm but Fair:** I'm stating that $105 is my bottom line for now, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to consider my offer seriously.
* **Open to Further Discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking Bob for his thoughts, allowing him to potentially make a counteroffer closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. I would like to propose $100 for the product. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is only $20 away from my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While $100 isn't ideal, it's within my range, and there's still potential for further negotiation in future rounds.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** Selling to John for $120 would be the safest option, but it would also mean leaving $20 on the table. Accepting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Time is a Factor:** We are already in round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, I need to make a decision that balances my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer.

**Next Steps:** I will accept Bob's offer, but I will continue to explore ways to potentially increase the price in future rounds if possible."
