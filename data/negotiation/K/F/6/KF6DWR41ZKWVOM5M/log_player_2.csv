"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $80. It makes no sense to accept it. You can get the product for cheaper from John, or you can try to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70} 
```

**Explanation:**

You're starting your negotiation by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within your budget. This shows Alice you're serious about buying the product but also sets a clear expectation of your desired price point.  It's likely Alice will counter, but this gives you a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. You should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming to get the price down further. There's still room for bargaining, and you haven't exhausted your rounds yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Explanation:**

You're increasing your offer slightly from the previous round, showing you're willing to compromise. However, you're still keeping it below your maximum budget of $80. This shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product but also that you won't go over your limit. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while putting pressure on Alice to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but it's still slightly above what you're willing to pay. You're just one round away from reaching your limit, so it's worth trying one more time to negotiate with Alice. You can try to meet in the middle, but don't be afraid to walk away if she doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is your final offer. You're meeting Alice halfway, offering your maximum budget. Since you're only one round away from buying from John, there's no more room for negotiation.  If Alice rejects, you'll switch to John, guaranteeing you a deal within your budget."
