"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit of $10. I know Bob values the product at $80, so there's room for negotiation. I'm also aware of John's offer, which gives me a safety net if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price. I have 8 more rounds to reach a deal, and I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a price of $90, which is still a profit for me and closer to Bob's valuation. This should hopefully encourage Bob to consider accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and continue negotiating. I have 6 more rounds to get a better price, and I can always sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $85. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it.  I have 5 rounds left and the option of selling to John, so I'm not desperate to accept a low price, but I do want to finalize a deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered his maximum price of $80, which is still a profit for me.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, I have only 4 rounds left and could risk getting a lower offer or even no offer at all. Selling to John for $100 is a safe option, but it's better to close the deal now and secure a profit."
