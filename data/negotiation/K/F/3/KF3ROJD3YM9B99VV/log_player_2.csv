Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession. I'll meet you at $138. It's the best I can do for now!

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your target, but it's getting closer. You've reached the midpoint of the negotiation and accepting the offer now ensures you get the product at a good price while still leaving some room for potential future savings. You can always try to negotiate with Alice again after the purchase if you find a way to improve the price."
