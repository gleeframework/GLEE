"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $100 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer of $90 allows Bob to potentially get a better price.  There's no reason to buy from Alice at $90 when a better deal is available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  Offering $85 is a good starting point, as it's lower than Alice's offer of $90, but still higher than Alice's value of $80.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still potentially getting a better deal than from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92 is worse than John's offer of $100. There's no reason to keep negotiating with Alice when Bob can secure the product at a lower price from John."
