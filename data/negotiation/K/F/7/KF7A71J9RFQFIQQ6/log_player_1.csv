{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it."", ""product_price"": 100}

This offer starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also provides a positive message to encourage Bob to consider the deal."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still too low for me. How about $95?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating.  I'm running out of time, but I'm still hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

```

I've rejected Bob's latest offer, and we're running out of time.  With only four rounds left, I'm no longer confident that I can get a price that meets my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $120."
