"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial offer reflects the significant value this product holds. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't accept $750,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which reflects a significant discount from your initial offer while still acknowledging the product's value. I'm confident this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
