"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

This is a good starting point because Alice's offer is way over your budget. You want to save as much as possible and rejecting the offer opens up the opportunity to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial offer reflects the significant value this product holds. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't accept $750,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

While $1,200,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your maximum limit of $1,000,000.  You want to save as much money as possible.  It's worth continuing negotiations to see if you can reach a more agreeable price."

I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which reflects a significant discount from your initial offer while still acknowledging the product's value. I'm confident this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
