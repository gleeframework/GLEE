Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial offer reflects the significant value this product holds. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't accept $750,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which reflects a significant discount from your initial offer while still acknowledging the product's value. I'm confident this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's trying to get a significant bargain.  John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000 which is my minimum. It's time to move on to ensure I get a fair price."
