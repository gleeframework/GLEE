Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but not too high to scare Bob off. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price, and I believe I can do better. I will try to counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Although $11,000 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum and I'm not confident that further negotiation with Bob will yield a better result.  Selling to John for $12,000 is a safe option, but I'm willing to take a slightly lower price for a faster sale."
