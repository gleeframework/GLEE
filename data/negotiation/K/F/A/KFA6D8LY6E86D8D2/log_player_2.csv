"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to the product's value to Alice, it's still above Bob's $8,000 limit. There are more rounds, so Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his limit of $8,000.  A $9,000 counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price while still leaving room for potential negotiation. This approach balances potential savings with the need to keep negotiations moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about $10,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than Alice's first offer, it's still above Bob's limit. There are still rounds left to negotiate. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. How about $9,500? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a counteroffer slightly higher than his last offer, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway. This strategy aims to show progress while still staying within a reasonable range.  A price of $9,500 is a good compromise considering both parties' needs and the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 for this round. This is my final offer before I consider selling to John. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is putting pressure on Bob, but Bob should still hold firm.  $10,000 is closer to Bob's goal, but he can still try to push for a lower price. There are still rounds left, and Bob can always buy from John if this negotiation fails.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm confident we can close this deal if we meet in the middle. How about $9,750? This is my final offer before I consider John's offer."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final counteroffer close to Alice's offer. This shows a willingness to reach an agreement while still trying to save some money.  This counteroffer demonstrates a commitment to closing the deal while putting pressure on Alice to accept.  The strategy is to try to get the best price possible while staying within Bob's budget."
