Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000:**  This price is a starting point that's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the mutual benefit of the deal. 

This approach aims to:

* **Start negotiations strong:** By offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, I establish a starting point that favors me.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** There's space to lower the price if needed, but I'm not giving away the product for a low price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** By being friendly and emphasizing mutual benefit, I hope to keep the negotiation productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I am open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for such a low amount at this stage.  

By rejecting his offer, I can counter-offer with a price closer to my desired range, hopefully leading to a more acceptable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I've increased Bob's offer by $100,000, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but not by a drastic amount. 
* **Message:** I've kept the tone friendly and emphasized fairness. I'm reminding him of the product's value while also demonstrating my willingness to compromise.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting his initial counter-offer, I've shown that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price. 
* **Bridge the gap:** My counter-offer narrows the gap between our desired prices, making it more likely that we can reach an agreement. 
* **Stay firm:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm showing flexibility to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's try to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Considering the potential of further negotiation with Bob, or the risk of losing time and potentially reaching a lower price with him in the future,  I think it's a reasonable deal. 

By accepting, I'm securing a sale at a price that's a good compromise. It's important to note that while I'm not getting my ideal price, I am securing a sale, which is the primary objective."
