"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $14000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $14000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10500 is still more than I can comfortably afford. How about we split the difference at $9250? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $9250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $9250, which would be $9875. What do you think?",9875.0,Alice,5,
