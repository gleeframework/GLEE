{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product for $180. It's a great deal, and I know you'll love it! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 180}
```

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $150. By offering $180, I am leaving room for negotiation while still setting a high starting point. I'm confident that Bob will at least counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $120 is too low. While I want to sell the product, I am not willing to go below my minimum value of $150. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $120 is significantly below what I'm able to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $150? That's still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $150 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $75? I really think this product would be a great addition to my collection, and I'm willing to pay a fair price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $75 is far too low. Even though I'm trying to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value of $150. Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I will sell the product to him."
