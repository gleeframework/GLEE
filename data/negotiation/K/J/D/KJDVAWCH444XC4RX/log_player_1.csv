Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be very valuable to you.  How about a price of $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price (e.g., $105 or $100) while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering a price too close to $120 might make Bob feel pressured and more likely to reject the offer outright. 

It's a delicate balance between maximizing your earnings and ensuring the sale goes through."
