"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be very valuable to you.  How about a price of $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is lower than your maximum price, you can likely get a better deal. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, and you always have the option to buy from John for $120."
