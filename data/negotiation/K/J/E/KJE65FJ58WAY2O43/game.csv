"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I believe it's a great deal, considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiations if you'd like to discuss further.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product might be subjective, but based on my assessment, I am only willing to pay $8000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I understand your assessment of its value. However, I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14000. This is my best counteroffer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've given it careful consideration, and I'm still only able to offer $8000 for the product. I hope this proposal meets within your range and allows us to move forward.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I've already met you halfway at $14000, and you're still offering $8000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm going to try one more time - I'll sell it to you for $12000. That's my final offer, but I'm open to selling it to John for $15000 if we can't come to an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to find a common ground, Alice. After reviewing our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable and brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go below $12000, Bob. I've already made a concession by offering it to you for $12000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm starting to think that $10000 is too low, considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $10000, which would be $11000. That's my final offer, but I'm still open to selling it to John for $15000 if we can't agree.",11000.0,Alice,7,
