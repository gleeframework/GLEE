"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a very competitive price, considering its potential and my other offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $800,000? That's my absolute maximum.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your budget.  However, I've received a strong offer from another buyer for $1,500,000. Given the value of this product, I'm inclined to accept that offer if I can't get closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to increase your offer at all to secure the deal?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
