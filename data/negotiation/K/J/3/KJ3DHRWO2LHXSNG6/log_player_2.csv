Round 3
Alice's offer:

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $110.  This product is really worth a lot to the right buyer. How about $140? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to switch! Alice is stuck at $140, and her language (""final offer"") suggests she won't budge much. You can get the product for $120 from John, which meets your needs perfectly."
