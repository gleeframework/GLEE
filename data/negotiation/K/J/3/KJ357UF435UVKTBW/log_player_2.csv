Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $11,500 is still more than Bob is willing to pay, and he has room to negotiate a lower price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his target, he can still try to get a better deal. He can counteroffer again, perhaps with a price slightly above his initial offer of $10,500."
