"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your consideration of my interest in the product. However, I would like to propose a lower price of $820,000. I hope this aligns better with the value you perceive in the product. Please let me know if we can come to an agreement.",820000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $820,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $880,000?  This would still give you a substantial saving compared to its value to you, and it's closer to the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think.",880000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, Alice. While $880,000 is a step in the right direction, I still believe we can find common ground. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $860,000? This would still represent a significant savings for me while maintaining a fair value for you. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $860,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $870,000. That's a good compromise and ensures we both get a fair deal.  I'm confident we can finalize this and move forward.",870000.0,Alice,5,
