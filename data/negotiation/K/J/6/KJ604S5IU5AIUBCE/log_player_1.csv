Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your consideration of my interest in the product. However, I would like to propose a lower price of $820,000. I hope this aligns better with the value you perceive in the product. Please let me know if we can come to an agreement.

How about we meet in the middle at $880,000?  This would still give you a substantial saving compared to its value to you, and it's closer to the value I place on it.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. While $880,000 is a step in the right direction, I still believe we can find common ground. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $860,000? This would still represent a significant savings for me while maintaining a fair value for you. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.
