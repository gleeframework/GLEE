"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe you'll find it to be a great value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $140, while John wants $150.
* **You're still saving money:**  Even at $140, you're getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $150."
