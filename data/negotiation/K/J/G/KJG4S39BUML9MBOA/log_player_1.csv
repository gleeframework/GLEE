Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

I'm still aiming higher. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds."

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,300,000. How about $1,275,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

Bob is very consistently holding to a pattern of incremental increases, and I'm running out of rounds to get much higher.  $1,275,000 is a solid profit above my minimum."
