Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire the product for a price that's beneficial to your business.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but lower than my minimum of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a good price for me. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message highlights the benefits for Bob, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates a willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to counteroffer if he's not satisfied with the initial price.

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to participate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would still give you a significant profit and would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me. Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value and keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still too low for me. I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you, while also enabling me to achieve my desired outcome. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise,  moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum.  
* **Highlighting Benefits:**  The message emphasizes the benefits for both parties, making the counteroffer more appealing. 
* **Maintain Openness:** The message reiterates my willingness to negotiate, keeping the conversation positive and encouraging further dialogue. 

This strategy keeps the negotiation going while ensuring I'm not accepting a price that is too low."
