"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire the product for a price that's beneficial to your business.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would still give you a significant profit and would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still too low for me. I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you, while also enabling me to achieve my desired outcome. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
