"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which still gives you a great deal.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $9,500? That's a significant saving for me and still a good deal for you.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
