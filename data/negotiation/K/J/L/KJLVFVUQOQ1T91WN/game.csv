"I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a great deal for you considering you value it at $1,000,000. Let's find a compromise that benefits us both.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer to $950,000, which is still a significant discount from my original price of $1,200,000, but I believe is more in line with the value I'm looking to get for this product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your willingness to come down, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which represents a significant discount from your initial asking price and is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
