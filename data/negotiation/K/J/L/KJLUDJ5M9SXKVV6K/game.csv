"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your position, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value the product brings to your business. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product for your business.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
