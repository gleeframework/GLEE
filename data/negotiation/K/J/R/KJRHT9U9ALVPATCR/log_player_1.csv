"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $100 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired range. I'll counter with a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $100 is a good price, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $105? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired range. I'll counter with a slightly higher price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle at $107.50.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $107.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $102.50? I'm trying to save as much as I can. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, the negotiations have gone on for several rounds, and the price is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value.  While I would prefer to get a little more,  it's time to secure the deal.  $102.5 is a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle for John's offer."
