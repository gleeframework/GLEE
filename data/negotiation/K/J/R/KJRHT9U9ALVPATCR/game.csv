"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum price. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to consider that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $100 is a good price, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $105? I'm willing to meet you halfway.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle at $107.50.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $107.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $102.50? I'm trying to save as much as I can.",102.5,Bob,6,
