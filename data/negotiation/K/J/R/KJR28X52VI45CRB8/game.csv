"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth a significant amount to both of us, and I'm willing to compromise. How about $850,000?  This price reflects the value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is my absolute limit. This price reflects the product's value to me and allows us to both walk away with a win. Let's make this deal happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,
