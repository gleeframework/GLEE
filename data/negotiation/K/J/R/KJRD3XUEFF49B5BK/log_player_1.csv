""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth at least $12,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $11,500 to you as a gesture of goodwill. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to get as much above that as possible from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below Bob's perceived value ($8,000) would be a guaranteed sale but leaves money on the table.  Instead, starting higher encourages negotiation.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning a public listing implies others might be interested, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

This offer aims to:

1. **Anchor Bob's perception:** Starting high ($11,500) sets an anchor, making Bob more receptive to a lower counter-offer that is still profitable for you.
2. **Leave room for negotiation:** You have space to come down in price if Bob negotiates, with the $10,000 offer from John as your safety net.
3. **Potentially secure a higher profit:**  There's a chance Bob might accept your initial offer, netting you the highest possible gain."
