Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value Isn't Realistic:** In a real negotiation, you wouldn't know Bob's maximum valuation. This response aims for a price that maximizes profit while remaining within a reasonable negotiation range.
* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations a bit higher than your desired selling price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like they might be getting a deal if they can get you to come down a bit.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""value"" and ""interest"" aims to create the perception of high demand, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, it's a calculated risk to aim higher initially."
