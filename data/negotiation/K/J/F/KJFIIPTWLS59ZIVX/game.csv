"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm very interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Is there any room for negotiation?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $1,100,000.  My final offer is $1,250,000. This reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it's a fair deal. Please consider it carefully.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll propose a price of $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
