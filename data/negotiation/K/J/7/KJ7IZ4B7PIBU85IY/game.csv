,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you be willing to come down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $87.50. Would you be willing to accept that price?",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $87.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $86.  Let's close this deal.",86.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $88, but I don't think I can go any lower than that. This is my final offer.",88.0,Alice,5,
