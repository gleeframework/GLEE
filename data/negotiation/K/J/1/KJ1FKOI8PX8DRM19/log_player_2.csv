"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than what you'd get from John, it's still over your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You can get the same product from John for a lower price, making ""RejectOffer"" the best choice."
