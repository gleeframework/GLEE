Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $110, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $102.  It's getting close to our maximum budget, and continuing to negotiate has a risk of Alice increasing her price or us missing out entirely.  It's better to secure the deal at a reasonable price."
