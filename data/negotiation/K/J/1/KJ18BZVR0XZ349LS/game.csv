"Alice, your product seems fantastic, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, considering its value to you and my budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  It's clear you recognize its potential value. While I acknowledge your offer, I believe it undervalues its true worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
