"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me at this point. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $82.50. Can you meet me at that price?",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a little. $82.50 is closer, but still not quite there. How about $88? It's a good compromise and closer to meeting each other halfway. Let me know what you think.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure about $88. I'm thinking more along the lines of $80. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle, but I really need to get as close to my target price as possible. Can you meet me at $80?",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $80 is still too low for me. I'm willing to move closer to your price, how about $84?  It's a compromise that's more fair to both of us. Let me know what you think.",84.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $84 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $81.50. I'm really trying to get as close to my target price as possible, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at that price?",81.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your need to stay close to your budget, and I'm also trying to get the best price for my product. How about we split the difference again and go with $83.25? It's a fair compromise and we can finally close this deal. Let me know what you think.",83.25,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $83.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm thinking the product is worth $80 to me, and I'm willing to meet you at that price. Can you meet me at $80?",80.0,Bob,10,
