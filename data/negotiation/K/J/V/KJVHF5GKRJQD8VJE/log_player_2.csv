"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer!  While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $15,000 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000.  While it's a step in the right direction, I'm not willing to pay that much. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can find a more agreeable price."
