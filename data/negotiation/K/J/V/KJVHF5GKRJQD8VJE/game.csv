"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000.  What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer!  While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $15,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a deal. What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,4,
