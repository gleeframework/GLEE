Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $130.  Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $130 is still too low for me, even though I'm starting to feel the pressure.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
