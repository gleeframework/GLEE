"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and hopeful to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob to make him consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity to Negotiate:** I believe I can still get a better price, so I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating. 
* **Time Constraint:** I have 10 rounds, so there's still time to try and reach a better deal with Bob.

**Next Step:** I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference and meet at $110? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Positive and  Encouraging:**  The message maintains a friendly tone, emphasizing fairness to further encourage Bob to accept.
* **Reasoning:** I'm offering a specific reason for my counteroffer (splitting the difference) to make it seem logical and reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105, and that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, even though he claims it's final.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds left, the risk of continued negotiation is high. There's a chance Bob will stay firm at $105, and I'll be left with a lower profit.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $120. This is a safer and more certain outcome.

**While I could continue negotiating, the potential gains don't outweigh the risks of losing out on the guaranteed $120 from John.**"
