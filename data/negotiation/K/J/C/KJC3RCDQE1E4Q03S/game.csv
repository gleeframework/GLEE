"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $20,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15,000.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $20,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15,000. I can meet you halfway at $17,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",17500.0,Alice,3,
