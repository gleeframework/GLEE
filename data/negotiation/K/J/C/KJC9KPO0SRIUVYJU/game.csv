"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1050000 for this product.  This price is still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll gain from it. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1050000. How about $1025000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
