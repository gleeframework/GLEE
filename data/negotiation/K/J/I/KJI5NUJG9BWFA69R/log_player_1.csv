"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is close to my minimum, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly, but I'm still holding firm on a value that's higher than my minimum.  This shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm not willing to settle for a price I don't feel is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a bit closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm getting closer to my minimum. This shows Bob I'm serious about a deal, but I'm still not willing to give up much more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but with only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out completely. John offers a guaranteed $10,000, which is more than my minimum, and it's time to secure the deal."
