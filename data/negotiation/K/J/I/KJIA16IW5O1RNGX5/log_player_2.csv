"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $20000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $15000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $18000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?
