"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $20000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $15000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $15000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $18000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $16000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than that, though. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $16000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $12000, so I'll offer $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $16000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you halfway from $16000 to $15500. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,7,
