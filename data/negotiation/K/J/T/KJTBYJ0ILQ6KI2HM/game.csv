,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. That's still a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do right now.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $100. How about we meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference - I'll go down to $97.50. This way, we both get a fair price, and I can avoid having to sell to someone else.  What do you say?",97.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $97.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $92?",92.0,Bob,6,
