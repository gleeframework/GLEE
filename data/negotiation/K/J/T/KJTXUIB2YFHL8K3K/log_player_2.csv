# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will deliver a strong return. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay from John.  It's worth exploring if I can get a better deal from Alice.  I'll try a counteroffer."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $750000 is below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm proposing a price of $850000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
