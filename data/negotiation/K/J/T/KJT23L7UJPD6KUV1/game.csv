"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not quite ready to drop to $1600000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1650000? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $1580000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $1590000. This is a compromise that's fair to both of us and gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",1590000.0,Alice,5,
