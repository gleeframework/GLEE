Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that value as possible while still making a profit. Let's say I'll offer the product to Bob for $850,000. This way, I'll earn a profit of $150,000 ($850,000 - $700,000).

Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 850000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still higher than the product's value to him. I'll think carefully about this one...

I'll choose option 2: Reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer. I'll try to get closer to my initial offer of $850,000. Let's say I'll offer the product to Bob for $820,000.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 820000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob has received my counteroffer of $820,000. Let's see how he reacts...

Since Bob's initial offer was $810,000, I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me in the middle. If not, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer or even sell the product to John for $1,000,000.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 820000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $805,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $805,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $850,000. I'll think carefully about this one...

I'll choose option 2: Reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer. I'll try to get closer to my initial offer of $850,000. Let's say I'll offer the product to Bob for $815,000.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 815000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob has received my counteroffer of $815,000. Let's see how he reacts...

Since Bob's last offer was $805,000, I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me at $810,000 or higher. If not, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer or even sell the product to John for $1,000,000.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 815000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is finally at $810,000, which is the same as his last offer. I've reached the point where I'm willing to accept a deal, and $810,000 is still a decent profit for me.

I'll choose option 1: Accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $810,000.
