"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer you $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,800. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,
