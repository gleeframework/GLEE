"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, Bob can likely do better. It's worth exploring counteroffers to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price down as much as possible while still staying within his budget. A $90 offer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a little too low for me. How about $95? That's a fair compromise, and I think it still leaves you with a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. He's willing to pay up to $120, so rejecting and making another counteroffer could potentially get him a lower price. It's important to remember that Alice is willing to sell for at least $80, so there's still some wiggle room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident that I would get good value for the product at that price."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground by offering $92.50. This is a further compromise from his previous offer and is likely within Alice's acceptable range since she's willing to sell for at least $80. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while still remaining within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. $92.50 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we settle at $94? That's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $94
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $94 is close to Bob's target price of $92.50, he's still willing to negotiate further. He's aiming to save as much money as possible, and there's still a chance to get a better deal. Rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer could potentially bring the price down closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $93.25. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 93.25}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small counter-offer, splitting the difference between his last offer of $92.50 and Alice's offer of $94. This shows a commitment to negotiating and hopefully will persuade Alice to accept."
