Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is the top end of your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has signaled this is her final offer. Accepting the $1,050,000 price saves $450,000 compared to John and avoids the risk of Alice walking away in future rounds."
