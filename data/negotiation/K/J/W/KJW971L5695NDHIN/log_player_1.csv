Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a price that is higher than his perceived value of $8,000, but still lower than my floor price of $12,000. 

Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **Maximize profit:**  If Bob accepts, I make a profit of $1,000.
* **Minimizes risk:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell the product to John for my desired price of $12,000.

This strategy allows me to potentially increase my profit while still guaranteeing a sale."
