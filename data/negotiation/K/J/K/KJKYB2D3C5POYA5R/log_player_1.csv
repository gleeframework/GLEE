"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I want at least $8,000, so I'm starting above that.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Opening:**  Starting high gives me more room to negotiate down if needed, and it allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate, so rejecting his offer allows me to try and get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's Offer:** While John is a safe option, I'm aiming for a higher price, and there's still potential to get it from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  A price of $8,500 is a good middle ground.
* **Signaling Flexibility:**  By dropping my price from $9,500 to $8,500, I show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** I'm remaining above my floor price of $8,000, which is important for maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** We're in the middle of the negotiation process, and I still have time to get a better price. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I'm still hopeful I can get a higher price from Bob. I'm aiming for as close to $8,500 as I can."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession by dropping the price from $8,500 to $8,200.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  I'm remaining above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price. If he rejects again, I'll need to reconsider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're now in Round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, the negotiation process is becoming time-consuming.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is only $100 above Bob's current offer, it's a guaranteed sale and I'm running out of time to get a significantly better deal from Bob. It's time to secure the sale and avoid further risk."
