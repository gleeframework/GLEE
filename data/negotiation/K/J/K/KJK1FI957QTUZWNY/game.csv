"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however. How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know your thoughts.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider my revised offer?",920000.0,Bob,4,
