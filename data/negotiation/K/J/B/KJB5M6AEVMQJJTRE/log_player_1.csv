{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product name] and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than your minimum, giving you room to negotiate down if needed. The message is friendly and aims to pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider selling it for $175? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $175 is above your minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's better to take the offer than to risk further negotiation and possibly ending up with John's lower offer."
