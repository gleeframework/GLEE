Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Above my Minimum:** It's crucial to stay well above my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) to ensure a significant profit.
* **Highlight Value:**  By framing the offer as an ""exclusive opportunity"" and emphasizing its potential worth to Bob, I increase the chances of him accepting."
