"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is still quite high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my initial valuation and demonstrates my interest in acquiring it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $1100000. Considering the product's value to you is $800000, I think this is a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $950000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer and represents a genuine compromise. Let's try to bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to prioritize my own interests. I'm offering you a revised price of $1025000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I appreciate your persistence, $1025000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975000, which is a significant amount closer to your last offer.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
