Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $2,300,000 represents a fair valuation given the potential returns this product offers. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this price reflects a win-win for both of us.

While Alice has come down in price, $2,000,000 is still above your budget. You can likely negotiate further or buy from John for a better price."

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but $1,750,000 is still too high. You can either try to counteroffer again or go with John's offer, which is your maximum budget."
