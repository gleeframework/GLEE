Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000.  I believe this to be a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any concerns."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High, Room to Negotiate:**  Offering the product at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation. While Bob might counter, it shows you value the product highly. 
* **Emphasize Value:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" aims to justify the initial high price in Bob's mind.
* **Open to Discussion:** By stating you're ""open to discussing,"" you appear flexible and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process.

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John.  This puts her in a strong negotiating position."
