"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a final price closer to my desired range. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and my openness to negotiation, fostering a collaborative atmosphere.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Willingness:**  His response will reveal how eager he is to purchase and how far apart our valuations truly are.
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Even if this initial offer is rejected, it sets the stage for potentially securing a price significantly higher than Bob's initial perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  However, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget for this product. I'm interested but only at a price that makes sense for both of us.  I'd be willing to consider an offer in the range of  $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John right now would mean leaving a potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me on this. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I significantly lowered my price from the initial anchor but remain well above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This signals a willingness to negotiate but holds firm on a profitable outcome.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This framing technique suggests fairness and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By staying in the negotiation, I'm exploring the possibility of exceeding my minimum acceptable price before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway, but $1,900,000 remains significantly outside what I can justify. This product is valuable, but I need the numbers to align with my budget. To be frank, anything above $1,000,000 will be a very tough sell for me.  Perhaps you see a path forward in that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly signaling his upper limit is near $1,000,000.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still have negotiation room and time before considering John's offer. I'll make another strategic move to try and close the gap without losing too much potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for us both. Let's aim for a win-win. How about we settle on $1,350,000? This reflects a significant adjustment on my end and brings us closer to a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's latest offer and my previous counteroffer. It represents a significant compromise on my end while still keeping the price significantly above both Bob's perceived value and my guaranteed sale price with John. 
* **Urgency and Value:** The message emphasizes a ""win-win"" scenario and positions this as a decisive moment in the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  I'm aiming to land within the $1,350,000 - $1,500,000 range. This offer sets a firm stance while allowing some room for a final counter from Bob if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to move on price is appreciated, but $1,350,000 is still too far from what I can agree to.  I need to be realistic about my budget.  To keep us moving forward, I'd be willing to go as high as $1,100,000. However, if we can't find agreement at that number, I may need to explore other options for this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical juncture. Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but his language suggests he might be getting ready to walk away.  While $1,100,000 is a tempting profit, I think there's still a small margin for pushing a bit further. I'm willing to take a calculated risk for one more round to see if I can get closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and respect your need to stay within budget. I've tried to be flexible throughout our discussions. To bridge this final gap, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,225,000. This is my absolute best price, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my last offer and Bob's latest, demonstrating ongoing compromise while remaining above my acceptable profit range.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  By stating this is my best price, I'm introducing a sense of urgency and pushing Bob towards a decision. 
* **Calculated Risk:**  I'm pushing slightly beyond the midpoint to aim for a higher profit, but I'm aware that I might need to accept a lower offer in the next round or consider selling to John if Bob remains firm. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With fewer rounds remaining, I need to steer Bob towards a close and avoid letting the negotiation stall further."
