"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to signal that you won't accept a price anywhere near that range.  You're better off rejecting and providing a counteroffer significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  However, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget for this product. I'm interested but only at a price that makes sense for both of us.  I'd be willing to consider an offer in the range of  $900,000."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** This counteroffer is substantially lower than Alice's initial offer. This signals that you're serious about a price closer to your budget.
* **Slightly Above Your Limit:** By offering slightly above $800,000, you have room to negotiate down if needed while still staying below your absolute limit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message keeps a friendly tone and expresses willingness to find a fair deal, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me on this. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer still greatly exceeds your budget. While she moved from her initial price, it's not enough of a concession to warrant accepting. You should continue negotiating, but be ready to walk away if she doesn't move closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway, but $1,900,000 remains significantly outside what I can justify. This product is valuable, but I need the numbers to align with my budget. To be frank, anything above $1,000,000 will be a very tough sell for me.  Perhaps you see a path forward in that range?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer pushes closer to your limit while making it clear you're serious about the budget constraint.
* **Transparency:** By being transparent about your upper limit, you encourage Alice to be more realistic if she genuinely wants to make a deal.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Ending with a question prompts Alice to respond constructively, whether by countering or accepting the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for us both. Let's aim for a win-win. How about we settle on $1,350,000? This reflects a significant adjustment on my end and brings us closer to a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer has come down considerably, it's still significantly higher than your $800,000 walk-away point. There's room for further negotiation. You need to show Alice that you're willing to walk away if she doesn't meet you closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, your willingness to move on price is appreciated, but $1,350,000 is still too far from what I can agree to.  I need to be realistic about my budget.  To keep us moving forward, I'd be willing to go as high as $1,100,000. However, if we can't find agreement at that number, I may need to explore other options for this purchase."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Near Final Offer:** This counteroffer represents a relatively small increase from your previous offer, signaling that you're reaching your upper limit. 
* **Direct but Respectful:**  The message is firm about your budget constraints while maintaining a respectful tone and expressing a desire to continue the negotiation.
* **Introducing Alternatives:** By mentioning ""other options,"" you subtly remind Alice that you have a backup plan if the negotiation fails.  This can encourage her to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and respect your need to stay within budget. I've tried to be flexible throughout our discussions. To bridge this final gap, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,225,000. This is my absolute best price, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away.  Alice is unlikely to move much further.

* **Stalled Negotiation:** While Alice has moved significantly from her initial price, her concessions have slowed down. This latest offer is only slightly below her previous one.
* **""Final Offer"":** Alice stating this is her ""absolute best price"" signals she's unlikely to budge much more, if at all.
* **Significant Savings:**  Buying from John saves you a substantial $425,000.  Even if you could negotiate Alice down a little more, it's unlikely to bridge that gap. 

By sticking to your guns and leveraging the option of John's offer, you can secure a much better deal."
