"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to go up to $8000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8000 is simply too low for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $10000? This is a fair price considering the product's value and your own benefit. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10000. I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $9000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within budget while giving you a better price than John.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 still isn't quite enough for me. How about $11000?  I'm confident this price works for both of us, and we can close this deal. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still only able to go up to $9500. This would be a compromise that would benefit us both.  Let's close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9500 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10250? This seems like a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal!",10250.0,Alice,7,
