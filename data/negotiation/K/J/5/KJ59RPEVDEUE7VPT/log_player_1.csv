Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $150, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary.  It also gives Bob a clear understanding of the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $175 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm counter-offering at $190. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $200 and Bob's offer of $175.  I believe this price is still fair while demonstrating my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, $180 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer and allows me to avoid further negotiation."
