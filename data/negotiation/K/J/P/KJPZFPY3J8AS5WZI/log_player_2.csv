It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **We're close enough:**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate but is unlikely to go much lower than $790,000.
* **Time is a factor:** We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds. Continuing to haggle might make Alice less flexible. 
* **Savings are good:** Getting the product for $790,000 is a $210,000 savings compared to John's offer.

It's a good deal â€“ time to accept!"
