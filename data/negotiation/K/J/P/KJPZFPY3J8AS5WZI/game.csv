"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $760,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can offer it to you for $795,000.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $775,000. I can offer it to you for $790,000.
