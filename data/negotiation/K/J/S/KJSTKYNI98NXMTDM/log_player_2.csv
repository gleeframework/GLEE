"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-value item that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
It's unlikely Alice will accept an offer close to $10,000 on the first round, but we can start low to see how she reacts."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $9,500 for the product. Can we discuss further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate and Alice is showing willingness to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. I can do $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice seems firm on $9,500, but it's still worth pushing a bit further.  We're getting close to the point where her profit margin might be too slim."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  I can do $9,100, and that's really stretching it for me.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 9100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to stretch, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $9,800, and that's my final offer. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $9,800. Accepting this offer gets us the product for significantly less than John's price and avoids the risk of Alice walking away in further rounds."
