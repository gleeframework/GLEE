{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth more to you than that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum desired price of $12,000, but it's also still a decent profit for me.  I believe it's likely Bob will accept, but if he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope this revised offer meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential you see in it. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I am unable to meet the price of $10,500. My maximum offer remains at $9,500. I hope we can find a middle ground that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It seems like Bob is firm on his offer of $9,500. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've already lowered my price significantly from my desired $12,000. John is a guaranteed sale for that amount, so it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
