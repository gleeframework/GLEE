"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $900,000 to make it worth my while. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $850,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $725,000?  That's a fair offer considering we're both making concessions.",725000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, but I think that's the lowest I can go. I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",750000.0,Alice,5,,
