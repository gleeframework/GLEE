"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me is $800000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $875000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $875000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I don't think I can go any higher.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a concession. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $850000. I'm willing to make a small concession myself and propose a price of $860000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you is $800000.
