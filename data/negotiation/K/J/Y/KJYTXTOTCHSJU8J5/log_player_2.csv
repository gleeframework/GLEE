# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The offer from Alice is way too high. I can get the same product from John for $15,000.  It's better to reject the offer and negotiate a better price with Alice or buy the product from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will deliver significant value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go a little higher than my initial offer, but $17,000 is still too high. I will make another counteroffer."
