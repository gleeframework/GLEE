"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get at least $1,200,000 from Bob, but I'm willing to walk away and get that from John if I need to.  Let's see how Bob reacts to this first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my goal, but I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower counteroffer than Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also determined to get a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price, and I'm comfortable accepting it.  I'm confident that I can get a better price if I continue to negotiate, but there's always a risk of Bob walking away or getting even more stubborn.  $1,425,000 is a good compromise, and I'm happy to close the deal."
