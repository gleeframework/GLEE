"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit closer to my target price.  Would you be willing to accept $1,150,000?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm still looking to get a good profit from the sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is only $25,000 more than Bob's maximum budget. This is a relatively small difference, and considering the potential for further negotiation to be lengthy and uncertain, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and secure the product."
