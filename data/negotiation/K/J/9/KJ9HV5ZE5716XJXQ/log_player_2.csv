"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It's closer to her valuation than mine. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a much lower offer ($10,000) to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This anchors the negotiation lower and leaves room for me to increase my offer.
* **Polite and Engaged:** I want to maintain a positive tone to encourage continued negotiation. I've expressed interest in the product while clearly stating my price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $12,500?  That gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $12,500 is still above my maximum budget. I know I can get the product for $12,000 from John. I'll try to meet in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $12,500 is still a little bit of a stretch for me.  How about we split the difference and make it $11,250?"",
""product_price"": 11250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting we split the difference between her last offer ($12,500) and my last offer ($10,000), I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below my maximum. 
* **Staying Firm:** I'm holding firm to my goal of getting a price that saves me money compared to John's offer. 
* **Time Consideration:** As we progress through the rounds, I'm becoming more aware of the time constraint. While I want the best deal, I need to avoid dragging out the negotiation too long and potentially missing out on both Alice's and John's offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,250 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle.  How about $11,750? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly anchoring the negotiation above my target price. While $11,750 is closer to acceptable, I'm running out of rounds. It's time to push a bit harder and see if she's willing to come down closer to $11,000, otherwise I'll take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, $11,750 is pushing my budget. I can do $11,100, and that's really the best I can offer.  It's a fair deal and gives us both something."",
""product_price"": 11100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer and that going higher is not possible within my budget. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing that it's a fair price.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only a few rounds left, I need to signal that I'm serious and ready to walk away if we can't reach an agreement soon. John's offer is looking more appealing as time runs out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's make it $11,400.  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** I'm down to the wire with only a few rounds left. If I reject this offer and we don't reach an agreement, I risk losing both Alice's deal and John's backup offer.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** While $11,400 isn't ideal, it's a decent compromise. It's lower than her previous offer and still saves me a bit compared to John's price.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting now guarantees a purchase and some savings. Rejecting and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of ending up with nothing or having to settle for John's offer."
