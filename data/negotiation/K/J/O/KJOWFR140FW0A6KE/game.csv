"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept $105 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize the deal!",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100? That way we both get a fair price. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,5,
