"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's significantly lower than its true worth.  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000.
* **Your value:** You value the product at $1,500,000.
* **John's offer:** John is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000.
