Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Situation**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he could potentially profit up to $200,000.
* **Your Goal:**  Maximize your profit.  Since you have a backup offer, you have leverage to push for a price higher than $1,000,000.

**Possible Strategy**

Aim high, but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. Offering a price between your minimum and Bob's maximum value is the sweet spot.

**Offer to Bob:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can help you achieve [mention a specific benefit Bob would get from the product]. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** Creates a sense of exclusivity and value.
* **Benefit Focus:**  Instead of just talking price, highlight how the product benefits Bob.
* **Strategic Price:**  $1,150,000 gives you a $150,000 profit (significantly more than your minimum) and leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 gain.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiation style and your own risk tolerance."
