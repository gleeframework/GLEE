"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both of us if you were to purchase this item at a special introductory price of $12000. This offer is exclusive to you and is valid for the next 5 rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice will lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the introductory price, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering your budget and the value you place on the product, I propose a price of $11000 for the item. This is still within your stated budget range but closer to my initial asking price. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Although Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further in price before committing to a purchase."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial range.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. Based on our previous discussions and considering the value of the product, I propose a price of $10900. This is a slight adjustment towards your suggested price while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin for me. I hope this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,900 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, he's only got 5 rounds left.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John. This guarantees a lower price ($10,000) and eliminates the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice."
