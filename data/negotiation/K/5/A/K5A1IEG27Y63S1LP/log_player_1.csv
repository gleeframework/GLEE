"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($100) to leave room for negotiation. I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport and emphasize the product's value. This will hopefully encourage Bob to consider my offer and potentially start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $100. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell. There's still potential for a better deal, and I'm going to try to negotiate further. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. While I'm willing to be flexible, $100 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $125? I'm confident you'll still find this a good value."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm counter-offering with a price slightly closer to Bob's offer, hoping to find a middle ground. My message emphasizes flexibility and fairness to encourage Bob to consider this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $110. This seems to be a fair compromise between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm willing to accept this offer because:

* It's only $10 less than my previous counteroffer, indicating potential for a deal.
* I'm aware of the limited rounds (10 total) and don't want to risk running out of time.
* I'm not confident I can get a better deal from Bob, and selling to John would only net me $100. 

Accepting this offer secures a reasonable price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
