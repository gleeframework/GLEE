"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling the product to you. I've given this a lot of thought, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it, and it's a significant discount from the market value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
