,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $155?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $155 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?  That's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",150.0,Bob,4,
