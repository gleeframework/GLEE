Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and a potential compromise. 
* **It's significantly lower than Bob's value:** This incentivizes Bob to negotiate and find a price that works for both of you. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** You want to be fair, but also secure a good deal. 

Remember, you can adjust this offer based on how Bob responds. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

It's still early in the negotiation, and Bob's offer is closer to your minimum than to his maximum.  I want to see if I can push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to compromise but still want a higher price.
* **Lower than your initial offer:** This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to meet you halfway.

It's a balanced approach that aims to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now only $50,000 away from my minimum, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  It's time to take the profit and move on."
