Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price of $120. This is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150, but it's also above the product's worth to Bob ($80). This increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I've left room for negotiation, as Bob might counteroffer. This gives us both the opportunity to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **The ""John"" Factor:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $150, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum price of $150, it's still significantly lower than I'd like to receive.  
* **The ""John"" Factor:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, which is much better than Bob's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially get a higher price from him. 

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a higher price, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** I'm offering $105, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $90. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still getting a better price than Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Highlighting the Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a great deal for him, as it's significantly less than my minimum selling price.
* **Continued Negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation, but I'm confident that $105 is a fair price that's close to what I'm hoping to receive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Enough:**  Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum price of $150, but it's still a significant difference. 
* **The ""John"" Factor:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, which is a much better outcome for me.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. 

I'm going to counteroffer Bob one more time, hoping to reach an agreement that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we settle on $100? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still be happy with the product at that price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering $100, which is closer to Bob's offer of $95 but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this final counteroffer will entice Bob to accept. 
* **Fairness and Value:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer by highlighting the compromise and the value Bob will still receive.
* **The ""John"" Factor:** I'm still aware of the $150 offer from John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob rejects this final counteroffer. 

This is my last attempt to reach a deal with Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to walking away, but I really want this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $100, which is $97.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not close enough:**  While Bob's offer of $97.5 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum selling price of $150. 
* **The ""John"" Factor:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, which is a much better outcome for me. 
* **Ending the Negotiation:**  I've already made multiple concessions and Bob has shown a reluctance to meet my minimum. Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price that meets my needs.

It's time to stop negotiating with Bob and accept John's offer for a much better price."
