Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $2,000,000 for the product. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me is $800,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're still hoping for a higher price, but I'm not willing to go above $1,400,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,400,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can either push Bob higher in the next round or secure the $1,500,000 sale with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,600,000? I'm willing to be flexible, but this price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're still trying to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm not willing to go above $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so let's try $1,520,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally find an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,520,000 is getting close to my minimum value, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  We are almost there, and I'm confident I can either get Bob to budge a bit more or sell to John for $1,500,000."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, we're running out of rounds, and I'm not confident that he'll come up to a price that meets my minimum value. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and I'm happy to secure that outcome."
