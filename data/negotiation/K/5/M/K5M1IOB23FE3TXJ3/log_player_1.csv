Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $100, which is a price point that is above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  A friendly message emphasizing the value proposition to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Reasoning:**

* This price offers a potential profit for me while also being attractive to Bob. 
* Starting with a higher price gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, but still allows me to potentially get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a higher price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed outcome. However, rejecting Bob's offer and continuing negotiation gives me the chance to potentially get a better price without risking a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $95, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a price point that is above my minimum.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer while emphasizing the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding common ground:** This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **Maintaining profit margin:** $95 is still above my minimum price point, ensuring I don't lose money on the sale."
