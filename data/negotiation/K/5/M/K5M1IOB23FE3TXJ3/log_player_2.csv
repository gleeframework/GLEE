"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $80 to him, he can get it from John for that price.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer of $100 is not beneficial. He should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $85. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Although Alice has lowered her price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. He knows he can get the product from John for $80, so there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
