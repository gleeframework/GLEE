"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That's a bit steep for me, though.  How about $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,

"Okay, Alice, you drive a hard bargain! How about $108 â€“ it's a fair offer and gets us closer to a deal.",108.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles.  Let's be realistic.  I'm not going to go lower than $110, and I know you're not going to go higher than $108.  How about we just split the difference and call it a day?",109.0,Alice,7,
