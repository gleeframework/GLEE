Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a more reasonable price. Considering the current market conditions and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still below my desired range. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my end.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still feel that $1,600,000 is beyond my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,550,000 for your product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price, especially since John is willing to pay my minimum.  The potential for a better deal with Bob is worth exploring further."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However, $1,550,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,575,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1575000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,525,000 is getting very close to my minimum, I am still hesitant to accept it.  My minimum is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to try to get at least $1,550,000. With only 4 rounds remaining, I want to ensure I maximize my potential profit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, the negotiations have stalled.  While Bob's offer of $1,535,000 is very close to my minimum, I'm not confident that I can get a better offer in the final two rounds.  John is a guaranteed sale for my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with him by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
