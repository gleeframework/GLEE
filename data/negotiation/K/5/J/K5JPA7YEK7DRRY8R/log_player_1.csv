Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $2,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
