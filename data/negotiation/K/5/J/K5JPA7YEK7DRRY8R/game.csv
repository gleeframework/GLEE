"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $2,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your time, but $1,650,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
