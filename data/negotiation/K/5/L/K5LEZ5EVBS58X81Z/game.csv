,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in the product, $2,250,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $1,750,000 for it. Let me know if that's something we can work with.",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,750,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the product's true value.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm prepared to go up to $1,850,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
