"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you think it's a good deal for both of us. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm going to offer $1,100,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is the lowest I can go. If you're still interested, this is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
