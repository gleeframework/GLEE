,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident that this product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This allows us both to benefit from the deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's compromise at $875,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  $875,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle on $887,500? It's a strong offer, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal on this.",887500.0,Alice,5,
