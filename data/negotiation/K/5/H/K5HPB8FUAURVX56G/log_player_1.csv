Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, and I'm definitely interested, but I'm going to have to push back on that price. $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $950,000. Let me know if that's something we can work with.
