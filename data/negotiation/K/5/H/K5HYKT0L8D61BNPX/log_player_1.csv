Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm aiming for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, I subtly imply that the price is justified, even if I don't explicitly state why it's worth that much to him.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The fact that I have another buyer (John) gives me leverage. While I don't explicitly mention John, the phrase ""before I list it publicly"" implies there are other potential buyers.
* **Polite and Open:** The tone is important. I want to be polite and encourage discussion, rather than making it feel like a demand. 
 
This offer aims to maximize profit while still being reasonable enough for Bob to consider."
