"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  Your goal is to get the product for under $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is the best option.**  Rejecting allows you to start negotiating a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $850,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,025,000? This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's a step in the right direction, you're still over your budget.
* **Continuing negotiation is likely to get you closer to your goal.**  By rejecting, you can make another counteroffer and continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win scenario for both of us.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $900,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000,  which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's getting closer to your budget, you're still $175,000 over your target. 
* **Continuing negotiation is still the best option.**  By rejecting, you can make another counteroffer and attempt to get closer to your $800,000 goal. You're not quite at the point where buying from John is the best move, as you're within striking distance of a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm feeling very confident that we can close this deal if you're willing to meet me at $925,000.  I truly believe this is a fair price that respects both of our needs.  Let's finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 still doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

* **Alice's offer is still a bit too high.** You are still $150,000 over your desired budget.
