"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $850,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,025,000? This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win scenario for both of us.  Let's work together to close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $900,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000,  which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's make this deal happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm feeling very confident that we can close this deal if you're willing to meet me at $925,000.  I truly believe this is a fair price that respects both of our needs.  Let's finalize this transaction.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 still doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe we're very close to a deal. How about we settle on $937,500? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to move forward. Let's make this happen!",937500.0,Bob,8,
