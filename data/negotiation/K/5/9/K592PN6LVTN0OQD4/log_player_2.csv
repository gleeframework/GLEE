"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum price point, there's no indication of the product's value to her.  There's a chance she's willing to accept a lower price. By rejecting the offer, you can initiate a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a significant discount, aiming to gauge Alice's flexibility.  It also emphasizes your interest in the product, while remaining within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a good price for both of us, and I think you'll find the product is well worth it. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is still within my budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she might not be willing to budge any lower. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price without risking losing it to John."
