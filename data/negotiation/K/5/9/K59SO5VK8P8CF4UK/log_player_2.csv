"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John.  $9,000 is still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly closer to Alice's value.  It's a reasonable starting point to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high, even after she rejected my counteroffer.  I'll try to negotiate further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This is a more aggressive strategy than the previous round, but it might be necessary to get closer to a deal before time runs out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, and we are now in the middle of the negotiation process.  While I could continue to counteroffer, I'm concerned that time is running out and I might not be able to reach a deal with Alice. It's better to secure the product from John at a slightly higher price than risk not getting it at all."
