"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
