Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key is to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the offer appealing enough to accept. Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, any amount above that is pure profit.  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000 gives you significant bargaining power.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your endeavors.  Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000 
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The Message:** It's positive, emphasizes the product's value, and subtly creates a sense of exclusivity.
* **The Price:**  $1,350,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you ($350,000 above your minimum) while still saving Bob $150,000 compared to his perceived value. This makes it highly likely he'll accept. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a walk-away price in mind (anything above $1,000,000 is a win).
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, you could consider a slightly lower price, solidifying future collaborations."
