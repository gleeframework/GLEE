"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, and I'm open to discussing it further. ",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $900,000 is significantly below my minimum. This product has considerable value beyond what you're suggesting. How about we meet halfway at $1,100,000? This reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you a competitive price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $1,100,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line. Let's try this: $1,050,000. This price acknowledges the value you're getting while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,6,
