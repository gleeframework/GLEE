"Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product for $1000000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $1000000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the product's value, we're willing to consider a price of $900000. This is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. We believe this price still reflects the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $900000 is still a bit steep for me. Given my budget constraints, I'm prepared to offer $875000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also allowing us both to reach a mutually agreeable agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We understand your budget constraints, but we still need to ensure we're getting a fair price for the product. After reconsidering, we're willing to meet you halfway between our previous offer and your latest offer. We propose a price of $887500. This is our final compromise, and we hope you'll consider it.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $887500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to offer $850000 one last time.  This is my final offer, as I'm ready to move forward with John if we can't reach an agreement.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while allowing us both to come to a mutually beneficial outcome.",850000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we understand that you're willing to meet us halfway, but we can't accept your offer of $850000. We're willing to make one more concession, but we need to get closer to our minimum price. We propose a price of $880000. This is our final offer, and we hope you'll consider it.",880000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $880000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, at $865000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to close this deal. If we can't come to an agreement at this price, I'll be forced to move forward with John.",865000.0,Bob,8,
