"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit while still giving you a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
