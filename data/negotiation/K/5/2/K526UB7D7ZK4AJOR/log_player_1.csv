{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is higher than Bob's valuation of $8,000 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product for Bob. This helps build rapport and encourages him to consider the offer.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a successful sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or counter again.
* If the negotiation stalls or I feel I'm not getting a good enough price, I'll move on to selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell at such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $11,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Message:**  I'm reiterating my understanding of Bob's budget concerns while emphasizing the fairness of my new offer. I'm also highlighting the mutual benefit of this price. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess whether to continue negotiating or move on to John.  I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, so I'm more inclined to continue negotiating at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a better offer than Bob's previous one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price closer to $12,000 or $13,000. I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal quickly, but I'm not yet ready to accept a price that's too low."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $11,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000.  This shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's persistence and reiterating my willingness to compromise. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the new offer and the potential for mutual satisfaction.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully consider my options. I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed buyer in John. If Bob continues to refuse to budge, I might be more inclined to sell to John."
