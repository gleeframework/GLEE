"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm afraid $9,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $10,500 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500. I'm willing to listen to your thoughts on this, but I'm not budging much further than this.",11500.0,Alice,5,
