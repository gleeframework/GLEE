"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,025,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
