"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's initial offer is above my maximum budget. I'll try negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's to leave room for negotiation while staying under my $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $65 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $75. This is still a great price for a product worth $80 to you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll hold off on accepting for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for considering my offer, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

I'm inching closer to Alice's price while remaining below my $80 limit. Let's see if she's willing to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $72. It's still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $72, which is a reasonable price and a good discount from her original offer. It's not worth risking a counteroffer and potentially losing the deal at this point."
