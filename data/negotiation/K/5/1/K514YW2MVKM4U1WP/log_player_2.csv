{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

This is a very high price, so rejecting the offer and negotiating further makes sense.  The goal is to save money, and there's no reason to pay more than $10,000 for the product right now."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}

Alice is getting closer to your price point but it's still a bit higher than what you're comfortable paying. There's still time to negotiate and potentially get a better deal, especially since you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

This counteroffer is a strong one, showcasing a willingness to compromise while also testing if Alice is ready to close the deal. This price is just above your ideal $10,000, and it leaves very little room for further negotiation."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is now very close to your ideal price. It's only $2,500 more than what you're willing to pay from John. It's likely that Alice will not go any lower, and you are running out of time. It's better to accept this offer than to risk getting a worse deal or missing out on the product altogether."
