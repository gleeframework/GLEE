Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer of $13,500 is:
    * Above Bob's perceived value of $12,000, giving me room to negotiate.
    * Below my guaranteed price of $15,000, making it potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob now means a faster transaction than waiting for John.

This approach aims to secure the best possible outcome without risking the sale entirely."
