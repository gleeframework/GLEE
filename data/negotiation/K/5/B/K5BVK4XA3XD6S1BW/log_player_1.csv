Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $11,000 is more than what Bob is willing to pay, but it gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still above your minimum value of $12,000, so you're not losing money if Bob accepts right away.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects, you can adjust your price slightly downwards or upwards depending on his counteroffer. 

Remember, the goal is to get as close to your desired price as possible while still making a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is closer to your minimum value, it's still below what you want to get.  You have a chance to get closer to your target price, so it makes sense to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,750? That's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
