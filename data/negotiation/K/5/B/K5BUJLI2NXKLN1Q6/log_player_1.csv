Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is slightly below my minimum ($1,200,000) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a high profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" aims to justify the high price, even if Bob is aware it's worth less to him objectively.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is open for discussion (""I believe this is a fair offer... What are your thoughts?""). This invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation, potentially revealing more about his willingness to pay.

**Important Considerations:**

* Bob might outright reject this initial offer, knowing John exists as a backup buyer. However, this strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit over guaranteeing a sale. 
* Observing Bob's reaction to this initial offer is crucial for adapting the negotiation strategy in subsequent exchanges."
