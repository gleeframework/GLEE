"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. You know the product is worth less to her, so there's room for a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your own valuation, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

```

While $900,000 is better than $950,000, it's still higher than the $850,000 you offered, and it's worth pushing to see if Alice will come down further.  You can likely get a better price than $900,000 by negotiating."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This price is closer to my initial offer and allows us both to save some money. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $885,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's best to accept Alice's offer. You've successfully negotiated the price down significantly from her initial offer of $950,000. While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and you having to buy from John for $1,000,000 outweighs the potential savings."
