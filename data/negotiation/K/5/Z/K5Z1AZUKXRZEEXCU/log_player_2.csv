"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering the product for $9,500, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay closer to $8000, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, you are still willing to pay less. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get the price down even more before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $8800. This is the lowest price I can offer and still make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll give you a final counteroffer of $8800. This is my best and final offer.

Alice has come down to $8,800, which is a good price, considering you were willing to pay up to $12,000.  It's likely you won't get a lower price from Alice, and it's a better deal than buying from John."
