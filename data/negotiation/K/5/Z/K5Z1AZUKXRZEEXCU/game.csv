"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay closer to $8000, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9000, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $8500?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $8800. This is the lowest price I can offer and still make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll give you a final counteroffer of $8800. This is my best and final offer.",8800.0,Alice,5,
