"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While I'm interested in the product, that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to find some more wiggle room. Would you be willing to consider $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
