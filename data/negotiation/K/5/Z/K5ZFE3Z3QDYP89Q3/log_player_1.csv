{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with $140, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  $140 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($150) than Bob's perceived value ($120).
* **Encourage negotiation:** The offer is not too aggressive, leaving space for Bob to counter and continue the negotiation. 
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always go with John who's willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not yet ready to sell. 

* **My goal is $150:**  I'd prefer to get closer to that goal before accepting. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I'm confident that I can push Bob a bit higher with a counteroffer. 

By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a better price. This also gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a price closer to my desired $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your business, $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $135? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Split the difference:** I'm offering a price halfway between Bob's offer and my previous one, showing willingness to compromise while maintaining a higher price.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Positive and friendly tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Get closer to my goal:** $135 is a significant step closer to my target of $150.
* **Signal flexibility:** It shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his initial price. 
* **Increase the likelihood of a deal:**  This counteroffer might be more appealing to Bob, making it more likely he'll accept and close the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $128? I'm willing to make a slightly larger compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $128 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not ready to sell. 

* **My goal is $150:** I'd prefer to get closer to that goal before accepting.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I believe I can still push Bob higher with a counteroffer.

By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a better price. This also gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a price closer to my desired $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $128 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet halfway between our last offers, at $131. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 131} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meet halfway:** Offering $131, halfway between my previous offer ($135) and Bob's offer ($128), shows my willingness to compromise while still pushing for a higher price. 
* **Emphasize fairness:** Highlighting that this price is ""fair for both of us"" helps appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** Maintaining a positive and encouraging tone helps keep the negotiation friendly and constructive.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Get closer to my goal:** $131 is much closer to my target of $150 than Bob's last offer.
* **Signal flexibility:** It shows Bob I'm open to negotiation but not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Increase the likelihood of a deal:** This offer could be attractive enough for Bob to accept, leading to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going up to $131. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers again, at $129.50. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating,  Bob's offer of $129.50 is still significantly lower than my desired price of $150. I've already made several compromises, and it's becoming clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.  

It's better to cut my losses and move on. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, which is more profitable than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
