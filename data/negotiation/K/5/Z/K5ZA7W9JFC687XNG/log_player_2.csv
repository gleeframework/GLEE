``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, there's still significant room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows him to try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm happy to consider your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While Alice's new offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There's room for further negotiation, so Bob should reject this offer and counter with a price closer to his target."

Bob is still trying to minimize his cost. While $1,025,000 is lower than Alice's previous offers, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  There's still potential to negotiate further, so Bob should reject this offer and make another counteroffer closer to his target price."
