"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $125? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still below my minimum. How about we settle at $135? It's a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting close. How about $130 and we call it a deal?",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  we're getting close! I'm willing to go down to $132, but that's my final offer.  It's a great deal for both of us.",132.0,Alice,7,
