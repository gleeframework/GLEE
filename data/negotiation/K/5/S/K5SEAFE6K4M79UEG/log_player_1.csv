"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $16,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000} 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a price that is profitable for you.
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer will help you understand how interested Bob is in the product and how flexible he might be on price.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have the security of John's offer ($12,000), so you can afford to be a little more ambitious in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $8,000. His offer of $12,000 shows he's willing to pay significantly more.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While $12,000 matches John's offer, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Early Stage:** It's still early in the negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer now doesn't mean you won't reach a deal later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Appearing):** By suggesting you're meeting in the middle, you signal a willingness to negotiate, even though you're still significantly above Bob's valuation and your minimum acceptable price.
* **Incremental Steps:**  Coming down by $2,000 from your initial offer shows flexibility but not desperation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's reaction and determine how much further you need to adjust."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to meet in the middle, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $13,000 is a significant profit above your minimum ($12,000) and a good deal overall.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating serious interest. Holding out for more might push him away. 
* **Time Value:**  While you have rounds remaining, closing the deal now provides immediate value and avoids potential risks of continued negotiation (e.g., Bob lowering his offer or walking away)."
