"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get a better deal. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm open to finding a middle ground, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This still represents a significant discount from the product's value to you, and allows for both of us to make a good deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can we try $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
