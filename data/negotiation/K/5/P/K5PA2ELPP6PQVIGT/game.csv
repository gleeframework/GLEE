,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1350000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1400000?  This would give us both a good deal, and I believe it accurately reflects the value of this product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $1400000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1300000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. However, I want to be fair and reach an agreement. How about $1350000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. This is my final offer. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to pay $1350000. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be within my budget. My final offer is $1250000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
