"Hi Alice, $16,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,750?  This feels like a fair compromise.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800. This is really my best offer.",9800.0,Bob,6,
