Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Motivating Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value proposition for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without immediately hitting your minimum price. 
* **Avoiding Immediate John Sale:** While selling to John for $120 is tempting, starting with Bob might lead to a better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value and Margin:** While $90 is closer to your minimum price, you still have room to negotiate for a higher price. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob is showing interest and willing to negotiate.  There's a good chance you can get him to pay closer to $100.
* **Avoiding Immediate Sale:** Selling to John for $120 is tempting, but continuing to negotiate with Bob could potentially lead to a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $95? That way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's budget while still getting closer to my desired price.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is positive and encourages further negotiation.
* **Strategic Price Point:** $95 is a psychologically appealing price point, often perceived as more attractive than a round number. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** This counteroffer keeps the door open for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can still negotiate further. Could you consider selling the product for $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $92 is very close to my minimum price of $120. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation.
* **Limited Upside:** While a higher price is possible, the potential gains are minimal compared to the risk of further negotiation.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome. 

Selling to Bob at $92 is a safe and reasonable choice given the circumstances."
