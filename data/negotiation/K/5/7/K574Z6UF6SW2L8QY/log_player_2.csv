"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Could you do $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming low to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite but Firm:** I acknowledge Alice's offer but clearly state my counteroffer.
* **Strategic Goal:** My ideal outcome is to get the product closer to John's price ($10,000) while leaving space for a compromise with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This would allow us both to get a decent deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John's Price:** Alice has met my bottom line by offering the product for the same price as John. 
* **No Further Negotiation:** There's no incentive to negotiate further since I won't get a lower price from John. 
* **Securing the Deal:** Accepting now avoids the risk of Alice retracting this offer in future rounds."
