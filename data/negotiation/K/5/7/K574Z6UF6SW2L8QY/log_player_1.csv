Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than Bob's valuation but is significantly lower than your own. This allows for negotiation space and shows flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Could you do $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is more than what Bob initially valued the product at, it's still significantly lower than what I consider it to be worth. It's worth exploring if we can reach a more acceptable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This would allow us both to get a decent deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
