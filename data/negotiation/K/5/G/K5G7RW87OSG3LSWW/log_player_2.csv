Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10000 is still too far off from what I need. I'm willing to come down a little further to $12500.  This would allow me to cover my costs and still give you a good deal.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

# Alice's message: Bob,  $11250 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a little short of where I need to be.  I'm going to propose $11750 as a final compromise.
