"Alice, your product is very appealing, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  $1,050,000 is my initial offer.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,075,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a little high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can reach an agreement.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $1,090,000, which is a compromise between my initial price and your latest offer. What do you think?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $1,090,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,060,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
