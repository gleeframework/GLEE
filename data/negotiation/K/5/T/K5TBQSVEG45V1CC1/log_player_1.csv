"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $10,500, I believe I can still get closer to my target price.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I can continue negotiating with Bob or even switch to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my target, I still have 6 rounds left and I want to try to push for a higher price. I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $10,875? It's closer to your offer, but still allows me to get closer to my goal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're really close to a price I can agree on.  Would you be willing to settle at $10,800? I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a little more,  $10,800 is a good price, especially since I only have 4 rounds left.  It's also a significant improvement over John's offer of $10,000.  There's always a risk that Bob could reject my next counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
