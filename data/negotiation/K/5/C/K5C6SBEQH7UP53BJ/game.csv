"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think the initial price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it will bring me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for presenting your counter-proposal. While $1,400,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe it falls short of reflecting the true value and potential this product holds.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,600,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while ensuring a good deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I still think $1,400,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that balances the product's value with my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
