Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think the initial price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it will bring me.

While $1,400,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe it falls short of reflecting the true value and potential this product holds.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,600,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while ensuring a good deal for both of us."",

I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that balances the product's value with my budget.
