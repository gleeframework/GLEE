"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm starting with an offer of $1500000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product will more than pay for itself. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1100000 is still a bit low for what this product can offer. To show you my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to go down to $1150000.  This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll need to move forward with another buyer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
