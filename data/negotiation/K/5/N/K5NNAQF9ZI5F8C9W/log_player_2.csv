"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,100,000.  This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what you're willing to pay.  However, if you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is eager to pay full price.  Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know John will sell you the product for $1,000,000.  It makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $100,000."
