Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product at the special price of $90. It's a great deal you won't want to miss!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum value ($100) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Secure a Profit Above John's Offer:** This price guarantees you'll make more than the $80 John is offering."
