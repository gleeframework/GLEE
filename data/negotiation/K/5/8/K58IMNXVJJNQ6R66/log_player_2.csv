"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I'm confident it's worth more than $100 to you, especially considering its worth to me is $150. To make this opportunity appealing, I propose selling it to you for $120. This price not only ensures a fair transaction but also allows you to enjoy significant savings compared to its true value. I look forward to hearing your response.
