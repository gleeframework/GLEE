"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,3,
