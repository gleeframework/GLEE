Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to find common ground, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is a good compromise. It's closer to your target price of $12,500 and still allows you to save a significant amount compared to buying from John. It's a win-win situation, and there's a good chance that further negotiations won't lead to a better price."
