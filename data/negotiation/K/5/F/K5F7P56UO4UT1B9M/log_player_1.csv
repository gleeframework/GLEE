"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find really useful. I'm asking for $120 for it."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to maximize my profit, so I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80). 
* **Not too high:** I'm aware Bob values the product at $150, so I don't want to start so high that he'll immediately reject the offer.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $120 gives us both room to bargain. I can potentially drop the price if necessary, and Bob has some wiggle room to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $90 is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I have 8 more rounds to negotiate. There's a chance I can get closer to my target price.
* **John's offer is always a safety net:** If the negotiations fall apart, I can always sell to John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $90 is lower than my asking price. However,  I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $105. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer slightly:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, demonstrating flexibility without significantly lowering my price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $105 still gives us both some room to bargain. This keeps the negotiation moving forward without feeling like a final offer.
* **Maintaining my position:** I'm staying above my minimum acceptable price ($80), while also giving Bob a chance to come up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's try to work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for a better deal:** We've made progress, and Bob is clearly still interested. I believe there's potential to reach a price closer to my target price with further negotiations.
* **John's offer is always a safety net:**  I can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiations with Bob break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price again, but I'm also staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Clear indication of compromise:** $100 is a clear midpoint between my previous offer ($105) and Bob's offer ($95).
* **Setting a deadline:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by emphasizing this as a fair price for both of us. This can encourage Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  How about $97? It's closer to what I can afford, and I think it's still fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $97 is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $80, it's very close.
* **Limited time:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiations. There's a chance that Bob might become less flexible in future rounds.
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he could walk away completely.  At this point, a sale for $97 is better than risking a complete loss. 
* **John's offer is a backup:** I can still sell to John for $80 if necessary.

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my target price, accepting $97 is a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
