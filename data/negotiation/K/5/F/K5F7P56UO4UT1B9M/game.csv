"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $90 is lower than my asking price. However,  I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $105. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's try to work something out.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  How about $97? It's closer to what I can afford, and I think it's still fair for both of us.",97.0,Bob,6,
