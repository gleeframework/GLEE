Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $130 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell it for. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $122. It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $122, and it's a reasonable price compared to John's offer. Accepting now avoids the risk of the price going up or missing out entirely."
