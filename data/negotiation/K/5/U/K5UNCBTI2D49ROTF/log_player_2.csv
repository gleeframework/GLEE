"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to part with it for $750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I have to say that $700,000 is still a bit below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $725,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, and $725,000 is within my budget.  This is a good deal, and it's not worth risking further negotiation to potentially get a slightly lower price.  There's always the risk that Alice will reject my next offer, and I might end up having to buy from John at a higher price."
