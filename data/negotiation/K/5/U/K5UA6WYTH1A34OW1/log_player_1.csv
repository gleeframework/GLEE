Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great asset to you.  I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get as much as possible, but you're also willing to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** This leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear message:** You've stated your price clearly and invited Bob to respond. 

This strategy sets the stage for a potential negotiation and allows you to see if Bob is interested in the product at your starting price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than your desired price of $9,500.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a higher price and potentially get closer to your target.  

**Next steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price closer to your initial offer of $9,500. This shows you're willing to negotiate but are not willing to accept a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference?  I'll accept $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise, meeting Bob halfway between your initial offer and his counteroffer. 
* **Fairness:**  $9,000 is still a good price for you, and it gives Bob a feeling of having negotiated a better deal.
* **Open to further negotiation:** You've left the door open for more discussion, indicating you're flexible but not desperate to sell at a low price."
