"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I understand that it's a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $775,000? That's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $775,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll give you a deal of $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
