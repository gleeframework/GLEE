"I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than that. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Can you consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I value our potential partnership,  $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider that?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I understand your position, $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that benefits both of us.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 again, as I think that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I still need to get closer to $1,100,000 to make this work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,087,500? This compromise would be a win for both of us, and I'm confident it's a fair reflection of the value this product brings to you.  What do you say?",1087500.0,Alice,7,
