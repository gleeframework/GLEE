"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product has value, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,100,000.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it's worth more. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle on $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's settle at $1,210,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair.",1210000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you holding firm on the value.  However, to be honest, $1,210,000 is really pushing the limit of what I can justify. I'd be willing to stretch to $1,190,000, but that's my absolute best.  If that doesn't work, I may need to explore other options.",1190000.0,Bob,6,
