"Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, it's still possible to negotiate further and potentially get an even better price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to secure a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $700,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. This counteroffer is a strong starting point for negotiation, leaving room for potential compromises."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $750,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial price and closer to Bob's desired price. While it's still possible to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and being forced to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly lower price."
