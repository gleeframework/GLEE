Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making a moderate offer to Bob. I'll offer him the product for:

{""product_price"": 800,000}

This is a significant discount from the minimum value of $1,000,000, but I'm still trying to get a good price for the product. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but it's still a significant amount of money. I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer that's higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer. Let's try to get closer to the minimum value of $1,000,000. I'll offer:

{""product_price"": 750,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send the counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 750,000}

This is a moderate counteroffer that's higher than Bob's initial offer, but still lower than my initial offer. I'm trying to find a sweet spot where Bob might be willing to meet me in the middle. Let's see how Bob responds!"
