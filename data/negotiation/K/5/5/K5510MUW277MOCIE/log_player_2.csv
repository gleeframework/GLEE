"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to make you a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is less than John's price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is willing to sell for $80. There's room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it works for my budget."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is still a good price for you. You're willing to pay up to $100, and it's likely you won't get a better offer from Alice. Accepting this offer means you save $10 compared to buying from John."
