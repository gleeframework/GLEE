{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to make you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that's more than your minimum but still potentially attractive to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.  It also sets a friendly tone and highlights the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it works for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $80.  It's worth pushing for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
