I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I'm not satisfied with just my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,350,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves a good margin for myself."

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiations. I'll sell to John for $1,200,000 to guarantee I get at least my minimum value."
