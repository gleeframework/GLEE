"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but I'm hoping to get close to that value. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}

I'm going to counter with $145. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $142 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm happy with this outcome."
