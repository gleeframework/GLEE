"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm open to offers, but I'm starting at $250. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 250}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's best to start high, leaving room for negotiation. $250 is a significant markup from my minimum, but it allows for potential compromise. 
* **Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product to me, which can make Bob think it's worth more. 
* **Openness:**  Saying ""I'm open to offers"" avoids appearing rigid and encourages Bob to participate in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $250 is way too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my max budget is $80.  Let's start there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is far off, he has expressed interest in the product. This indicates potential for negotiation and a higher price in the future.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  While $150 is my minimum, it's important to remember John is a guaranteed buyer.  If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, but I'm willing to come down to $180.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it gives us both room to negotiate.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $180 is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's initial offer. It shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a fair profit margin.
* **Highlighting the discount:** Emphasizing that $180 is a significant discount from my initial offer can make the counteroffer seem more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining the negotiation:**  Suggesting ""room to negotiate"" keeps the door open for further discussion and potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $180 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Bob has stated that $100 is his ""absolute limit,"" but this could be a negotiating tactic.  There's still potential for a higher counteroffer from him.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:**  If negotiations continue to stall, John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum price.  This option ensures I don't lose out on a profitable sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to keep negotiating. However, $100 is just too far below what this product is worth to me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and it shows my commitment to finding a solution that benefits us both. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and a reasonable counter:** $120 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. 
* **Emphasize value:**  I remind Bob that $100 is too low for the product's value. 
* **Express commitment:** Saying ""I'm committed to finding a solution that benefits us both"" shows flexibility and a desire for a deal.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I don't explicitly state this is my final offer, leaving open the possibility for further compromise if Bob is still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal that will work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob is stubbornly sticking to his $100 offer, which is below my minimum acceptable price.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result.
* **Time is running out:** We're at Round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, the risk of not securing a deal with John becomes more significant.
* **John is a safe bet:**  John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum price of $150.  This is a more profitable and less risky option than continuing negotiations with Bob."
