"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm open to offers, but I'm starting at $250. What do you think?",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $250 is way too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my max budget is $80.  Let's start there.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, but I'm willing to come down to $180.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it gives us both room to negotiate.  What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $180 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to keep negotiating. However, $100 is just too far below what this product is worth to me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and it shows my commitment to finding a solution that benefits us both. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal that will work.",100.0,Bob,6,
