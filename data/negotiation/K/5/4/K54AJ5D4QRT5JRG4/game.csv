"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is just a little too low for me. How about $95?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. Can you consider that?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $92.50 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $93.75? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.",93.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $93.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92.00, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",92.0,Bob,6,
