"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $200. It's a steal, if I do say so myself!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $160? It's a fair price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. I'm confident that I can find value in it, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can we meet at $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $140? It's still a good price for the product, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. I'm starting to think that's the best I can do, and I'm hoping you'll be willing to meet me at that price. Can we finalize the deal at $130?",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $135? It's still a good price for the product, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. If not, I'm willing to consider other options.",135.0,Alice,7,
