"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable paying $10,000.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
