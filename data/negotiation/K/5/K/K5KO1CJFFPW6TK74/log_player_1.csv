Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to make him more likely to consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation, which is crucial in this type of scenario.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $12,000 from John gives me leverage during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable paying $10,000.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob. 
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 allows me to be more assertive in negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my minimum, but still within a range that might make him willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $10,000 to $9,500.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Win-Win Approach:**  I'm framing the negotiation as a win-win situation, where both of us can benefit from a fair deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $9,500 is still above Bob's offer, I'm leaving room for further negotiation to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
