"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so he shouldn't pay more.  He can counteroffer Alice with a lower price to see if he can get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's price is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and while she has come down some, she is likely not going to budge much further. At this point, it is better for Bob to just go with the guaranteed price from John."
