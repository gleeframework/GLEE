Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Above Minimum:** The price is still comfortably above your minimum acceptable price ($10,000).

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
