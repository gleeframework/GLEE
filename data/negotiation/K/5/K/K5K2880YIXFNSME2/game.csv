"Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time. Let's see if we can work something out.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $11,500. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm going to offer $11,000. This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
