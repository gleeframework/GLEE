"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 and Alice is offering the product at that price, you have no incentive to accept her offer. You can get the product for the same price from John. Therefore, it's best to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
