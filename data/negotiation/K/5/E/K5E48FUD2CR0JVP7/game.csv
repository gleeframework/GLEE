I've already offered $130 and you're asking me to go back to $125? I'm not willing to go that low. My final offer is $128. This is as low as I can go.,128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, but I'm still not comfortable with $128. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $128, which would be $124. Would you be willing to accept that?",124.0,Bob,8,
