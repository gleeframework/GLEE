"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to accommodate your needs.  This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and agree on $825,000.  This price is within my budget and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you say?",825000.0,Bob,4,
