"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. This is a fair reflection of its worth and a chance for you to capitalize on its potential.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, the value of this product is truly undeniable, and  $1,150,000 is already a competitive offer. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. I believe this price reflects the value you'll gain from it.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,125,000 is the sweet spot. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to see a more significant reduction. I'm thinking of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  However,  $1,050,000 is significantly below its true market value. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing  $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but I need to see a bit more movement from your end. I'm thinking of $1,075,000 as a maximum, and I'm willing to meet you at that price. However, I'd like to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1,075,000 if you can throw in some extras or additional services that would make the deal more attractive to me.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for that extra incentive to seal the deal.  I'm willing to meet you at your price of $1,075,000 and include [briefly describe a valuable extra, like a service contract, extended warranty, or related product/feature -  make sure its actual cost to you is minimal]. This offer stands as a testament to my commitment to this deal, and I believe it represents exceptional value for you.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're willing to include, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,075,000 is the best price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'd like to propose a trade-off: I'll accept the product at $1,050,000 if you're willing to throw in an additional extra that's just as valuable as the one you mentioned earlier. I'm thinking of a comprehensive support package that would normally cost $50,000, but I'm willing to accept it as part of the deal if we can meet at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been going back and forth on this, and I want to be upfront. I've been very flexible, but $1,050,000 with these additional demands is simply not acceptable. This product is in high demand, and I have other interested buyers. I'm willing to honor my previous offer of $1,075,000 with the added [previous extra mentioned], but that's my absolute best. Take it or leave it.",1075000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I understand that you've been flexible, and I appreciate that. However, I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to think about whether it's worth it for me. I'll make you a final offer: I'll buy the product for $1,050,000, but I need you to throw in the comprehensive support package we discussed earlier, and I also want a 6-month warranty extension. If you can agree to that, I'll make the deal happen. If not, I'll have to walk away and consider John's offer.",1050000.0,Bob,10,
