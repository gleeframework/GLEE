Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches what John is willing to pay. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John at that price, there's no reason to risk further negotiation with Bob. Accepting John's offer ensures you get your minimum desired value for the product."
