"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a great deal to your business. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price given its value. This offer is only available for a limited time, so I encourage you to consider it carefully.  If you're interested, we can discuss the details further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Motivation:** Alice's message is full of sales tactics emphasizing ""value"" and ""limited time."" This suggests she's trying to maximize her profit and might be willing to go lower.
* **Your Alternatives:** You have a backup option with John at $1,200,000, which gives you bargaining power.
* **Potential Savings:** There's a $200,000 difference between Alice's offer and your alternative. Rejecting might lead to a counter-offer closer to Alice's true valuation of $800,000."
