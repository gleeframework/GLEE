Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $80 gives you a strong fallback position.  This allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob.
* **Direct and Concise:** The message is clear and to the point, focusing on Bob's potential interest and the exclusive pre-listing offer.

It's important to remember that this is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to adjust your price slightly downward if Bob shows resistance, but don't go below your $80 minimum!"
