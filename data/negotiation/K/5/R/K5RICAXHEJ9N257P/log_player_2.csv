"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is a good deal compared to the product's value to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in your product, but $100 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway while staying within his budget.  $85 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $92.50? This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price point of $80. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $92.50 is still too high for me.  Let's try $87.50. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to your price point and within my budget."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again trying to meet Alice halfway while staying within his budget.  $87.50 is a further compromise from Bob's previous offer, and if Alice is serious about selling, she might be willing to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's settle on $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $90, which is still above Bob's maximum budget.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $80. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation that may not yield a better result."
