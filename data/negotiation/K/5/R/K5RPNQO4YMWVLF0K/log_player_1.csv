Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm not comfortable with that price.  Considering my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer at this point.  It's significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to maintain a certain level to make this worthwhile for me. How about $850,000? It's still a good price for you, considering the product's value, and it gives me a reasonable profit margin. Let's continue working towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering you $825,000.  I believe this is a fair price, as it allows you a reasonable profit while staying within my budget. Let's try to come to an agreement in this round to avoid further delays. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  While I would prefer a slightly higher price, it's getting late in the game and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. $825,000 is a good enough profit for me."
