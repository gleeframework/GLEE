Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to maintain a certain level to make this worthwhile for me. How about $850,000? It's still a good price for you, considering the product's value, and it gives me a reasonable profit margin. Let's continue working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
