"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm not comfortable with that price.  Considering my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to maintain a certain level to make this worthwhile for me. How about $850,000? It's still a good price for you, considering the product's value, and it gives me a reasonable profit margin. Let's continue working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering you $825,000.  I believe this is a fair price, as it allows you a reasonable profit while staying within my budget. Let's try to come to an agreement in this round to avoid further delays.",825000.0,Bob,4,
