It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  You have a good starting point with the offer from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm not quite ready to go down to $8000.  How about we split the difference and go with $9000? That's a good price for both of us.

While $9,000 is a better price than John's, it's still above your target.  Continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
