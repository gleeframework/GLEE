**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal.  It will be interesting to see how Alice responds."

{""product_price"": 1250000}

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,250,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Alice's price but still within my budget. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also signals that I'm not willing to go much higher."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and it's clear that we are not going to reach an agreement at a price I'm comfortable with.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to waste any more time. Buying from John for $1,500,000 is the best option at this point. It guarantees I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
