Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. However, I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This gives you room to negotiate.
* **Gauging Interest:** By starting at $15,000, you can gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. His response will indicate if he's willing to negotiate near your desired range.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""open to discussing"" signals willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, providing you leverage.  While you don't mention John explicitly, knowing you have this option makes you a more confident negotiator."
