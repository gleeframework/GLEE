"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000?  That way we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $775,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
