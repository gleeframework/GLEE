# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You can aim to get the price closer to your target of $150.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  I'm confident this is a fair price that's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.
