"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $140, there's space for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's being unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $140 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Consideration:** While $130 is closer to my minimum value, I'm aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Negotiation Advantage:**  I have the advantage here. Bob is interested, and rejecting his offer allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Staying Open:** I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  There's still time to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand $130 is a fair offer, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we split the difference at $135?  That way, we both get a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway, but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:**  Emphasizing ""we both get a good deal"" fosters a collaborative tone and helps Bob feel valued.
* **Staying Firm:** While willing to compromise, I'm not giving in entirely. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but also my desire for a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to go up to $132, but no more. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal in Sight:**  I'm getting closer to my desired price, but $132 is still below my target.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still potential to get a better price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going.
* **John as a Backstop:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me the confidence to hold out for a slightly higher price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $133.  Let's finalize this deal and both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 133}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession to show I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm not giving up too much.
* **Focus on Finality:**  By emphasizing ""finalizing the deal,"" I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive and friendly tone helps maintain rapport and encourages Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $133 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $131, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not There Yet:**  $131 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob's message suggests he's still willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer keeps the door open for a higher counteroffer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm comfortable with my ability to sell to John for $150, so I can afford to be patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $131 is still a bit below what I can accept.  Let's split the difference one last time - $132. If we can agree on that, we can wrap this up."", ""product_price"": 132}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final attempt to meet Bob halfway. It shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going any lower.
* **Emphasis on Finality:**  The message reinforces that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Closing the Deal:** The phrase ""wrap this up"" suggests a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close, but I still think $132 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  We've reached a stalemate. Bob is unwilling to go above $130, and I'm unwilling to go below $132. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only two rounds remaining, the likelihood of Bob changing his mind is slim.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John is a sure thing, offering a price that meets my minimum requirement and provides a decent profit.

It's not ideal to miss out on a potential sale to Bob, but with a guaranteed sale to John, it's the most sensible decision to secure my desired profit."
