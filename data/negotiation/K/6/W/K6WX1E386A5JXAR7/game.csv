"I'm interested in the product, but I think $140 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand $130 is a fair offer, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we split the difference at $135?  That way, we both get a good deal. ",135.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $133.  Let's finalize this deal and both be happy with the outcome.",133.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $131 is still a bit below what I can accept.  Let's split the difference one last time - $132. If we can agree on that, we can wrap this up.",132.0,Alice,7,
