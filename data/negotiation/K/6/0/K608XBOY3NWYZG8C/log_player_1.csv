Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a higher profit:**  By offering a higher price, I increase the chance of getting a higher profit if Bob accepts.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** If Bob is interested, he may counteroffer with a lower price, giving us an opportunity to negotiate.
* **Worst case scenario:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell the product to John for $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.

This strategy balances the desire for higher profit with the need to ensure a sale."
