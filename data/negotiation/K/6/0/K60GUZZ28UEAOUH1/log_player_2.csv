Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, $700,000 is considerably below its true worth and my minimum acceptable price.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,000,000.  This acknowledges the value it holds for both of us while allowing for a profitable transaction on both sides.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I value the negotiation process and want to find a solution that works. However, the gap between $750,000 and the value this product represents remains substantial.  To demonstrate my commitment to getting this done, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. I believe this is a significant move on my part and reflects a genuine desire to strike a deal.
