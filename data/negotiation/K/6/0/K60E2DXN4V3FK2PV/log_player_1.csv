Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering what you'll gain from it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for your price (""given its value"", ""what you'll gain"") can make it more palatable to the buyer.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By saying ""What do you think?"", you invite Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation.

**Important Note:** While John represents your ""safety net"" at $10,000,  this strategy aims to maximize your potential profit with Bob."
