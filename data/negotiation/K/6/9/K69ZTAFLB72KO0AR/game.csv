"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  This still leaves room for both of us to get a fair deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,500. Can you consider that?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, I'm not comfortable going below $15,500. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a decent profit while giving you a good deal.  Let's close this deal. ",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you at $14,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to sell at this price, I'll make the deal. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15,000.",14000.0,Bob,6,
