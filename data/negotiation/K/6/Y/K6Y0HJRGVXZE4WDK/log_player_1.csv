This initial offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, giving room for negotiation and allowing me to potentially secure a price closer to my desired $1,500,000 minimum."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing negotiations.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This is a fair price for the product and allows us to both make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,625,000 for the product. I hope this suggestion is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,650,000, $1,625,000 is still a good price and within my acceptable range. It's important to recognize that the risk of further negotiation could lead to a lower offer or even a rejection, potentially forcing me to accept John's offer of $1,500,000."
