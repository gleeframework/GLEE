"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:

* Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($1,350,000 vs $1,000,000). This indicates room for negotiation.
* The offer is below your maximum price ($1,500,000), but there's potential to save more. 
* Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a great starting point. However, I'm looking to invest in this product at a lower price point. I'd like to offer $1,100,000 for it, given its value to me. This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is certainly appealing, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning:

* Alice's offer is significantly lower than your initial rejection point ($1,225,000 vs $1,100,000). This indicates that she is willing to negotiate further.
* The offer is within your budget and still saves you a considerable amount compared to buying from John ($1,500,000). 
* Accepting the offer allows you to secure the product at a good price and move forward."
