"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $110. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible while still getting the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $110, which is still more than your maximum budget of $120.
* **John's offer:** $120, which is your maximum budget.

Since you can get the product from John for your maximum price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
