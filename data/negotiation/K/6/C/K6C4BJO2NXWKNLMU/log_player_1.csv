Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000 
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $500,000 (the difference between what Bob values it at and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal. Offering something slightly below his maximum perceived value increases the chances he'll accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,400,000 is a significant profit margin for you while still being $100,000 less than Bob's perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if John is your only other option) adds a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly. 
* **Confident Tone:** You're not desperately trying to sell. You believe in the product's value, which makes Bob more likely to as well.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. Negotiation is an art, and factors like your relationship with Bob, your risk tolerance, and Bob's personality could influence your strategy."
