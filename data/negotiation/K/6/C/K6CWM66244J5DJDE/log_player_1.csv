I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers. I've chosen $18,000 as a starting point, as it's a relatively high but not unreasonable price. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by lowering my price to $15,000. This is still above my minimum of $12,000 and shows that I am willing to negotiate, but it also demonstrates that I believe the product is worth more."

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower. At this point, it's likely we are too far apart in our valuations, and I don't want to risk going through more rounds of negotiation. Selling to John guarantees me $12,000, which is above my minimum and a safe bet compared to the uncertainty of further negotiation."
