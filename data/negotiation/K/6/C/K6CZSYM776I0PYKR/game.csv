"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think the product is worth it to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I think it's a great product, $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about $12,500? I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit on this sale.",12500.0,Alice,5,
