```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I have to consider my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $15,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $14,000 as it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $15,000, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his budget, he's still within his 10 rounds and can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He's only $1,000 away from his target price, and continuing negotiations might get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference again - I'm offering $13,500.  This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting close to your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $14,500. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $15,000. My counteroffer is $14,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  

Here's why:

* **Negotiation is getting tough:** Alice is not budging significantly, and the price is still above Bob's ideal target.
* **Time is running out:**  Bob has only 3 rounds left. It's unlikely Alice will come down to his desired price in that time.
* **John offers a guaranteed deal:** John's offer is a sure thing, and it's within Bob's budget.

While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching a deal within the remaining rounds is high.  It's better to secure the product from John and save money."
