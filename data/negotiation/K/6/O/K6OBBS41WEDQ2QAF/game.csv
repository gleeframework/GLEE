"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value you're offering.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $13750. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12500, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to accept this price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
