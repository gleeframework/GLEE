{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. I'm aware he may reject this offer, but it's a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $18,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $19,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I hope this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still significantly higher than selling to John.  At this point, I'm more likely to get a better price by accepting and moving on than by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
