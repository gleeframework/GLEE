"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, which would be $102.50. It's the best I can do.",102.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for working with me. It seems like we're getting close to a deal. How about $98? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $98. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $105? It's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",105.0,Alice,7,
