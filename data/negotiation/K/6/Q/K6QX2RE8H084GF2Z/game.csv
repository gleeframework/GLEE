"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a good price while still staying within my budget.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $15,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
