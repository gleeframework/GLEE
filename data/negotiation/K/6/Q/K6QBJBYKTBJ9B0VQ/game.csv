"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price point is a little high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but still a little high for me. How about we settle at $700,000?  That would be a fair deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still not satisfied with the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",850000.0,Alice,5,
