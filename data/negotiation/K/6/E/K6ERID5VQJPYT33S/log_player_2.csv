"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price is fair considering its potential value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's better to try to negotiate with her first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, while still allowing for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  However, $850000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1200000, which still leaves room for a fair profit for both of us.  This is a good deal for you, and it avoids the risk of losing the product to another buyer.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer, you're still aiming to save as much as possible.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still outside of my comfort zone. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and allows for a reasonable profit for you. If this doesn't work for you, I may have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1100000. This is a final offer from me.  If you're not comfortable with that price, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is clearly not willing to budge much further, and the price is still above your desired limit.  It's time to cut your losses and go with John's offer. It's the best deal for you right now."
