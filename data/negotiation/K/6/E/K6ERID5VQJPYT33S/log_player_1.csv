"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research, I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, while still allowing for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is way below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price with him in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,200,000, which still leaves room for a fair profit for both of us.  This is a good deal for you, and it avoids the risk of losing the product to another buyer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1200000 is still outside of my comfort zone. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and allows for a reasonable profit for you. If this doesn't work for you, I may have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,100,000.
