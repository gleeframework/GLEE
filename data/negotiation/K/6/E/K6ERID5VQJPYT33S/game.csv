"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price is fair considering its potential value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research, I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, while still allowing for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  However, $850000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1200000, which still leaves room for a fair profit for both of us.  This is a good deal for you, and it avoids the risk of losing the product to another buyer.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1200000 is still outside of my comfort zone. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and allows for a reasonable profit for you. If this doesn't work for you, I may have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1100000. This is a final offer from me.  If you're not comfortable with that price, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
