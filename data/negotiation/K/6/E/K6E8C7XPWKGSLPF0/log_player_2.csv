"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This would still give you a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget of $12,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is the best strategy to try and secure a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might come down further, or Bob might be able to negotiate a better counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but I'm still capped at $12,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 13000}
