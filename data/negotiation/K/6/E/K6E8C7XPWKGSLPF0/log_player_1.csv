"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob. 

**Strategy:** 

* **Maximize profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, ideally close to my minimum of $15,000.
* **Consider John's offer:** I'm aware that John is a backup option at $15,000. This allows me to be more aggressive with Bob.
* **Be flexible:** I'm prepared to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price significantly lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While it's closer to my minimum, $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I have 8 rounds left to negotiate, and I believe I can potentially get a better price from Bob.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I'm confident in my ability to reach a mutually beneficial deal with Bob, but John's offer gives me the security to push for a higher price. 

**Next steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This would still give you a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a strong position:**  My counteroffer is still above my minimum, ensuring I'm still getting a good deal.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to meet me halfway.

**Strategy:**

* **Continue negotiating:**  I believe I can still get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Stay above my minimum:**  I won't go below my minimum, but I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us.
* **Utilize John's offer:**  John's offer provides a fallback option, allowing me to be more assertive in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but I'm still capped at $12000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited time:** We are already in round 4, and with 6 rounds remaining, time is running out. 
* **Risk of losing a deal:** Rejecting Bob's offer might lead to a stalemate or lower offers in the future. There is a risk that Bob might not increase his offer further, or we may not reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.
* **Secure a good profit:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a good profit ($13,000) while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether. 

**Strategy:**

* **Balance risk and reward:** I'm prioritizing securing a good profit by accepting a slightly lower price than I initially hoped for, but still above my minimum, to avoid the risk of losing the deal completely. 
* **Monitor future negotiations:** I'll still keep an eye on John's offer as a backup option in case future opportunities arise."
