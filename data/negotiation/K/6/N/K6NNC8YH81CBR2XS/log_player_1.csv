"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and reach a mutually agreeable price. Selling to John at $12,000 is a safe option, but I'd prefer to try and get a higher price from Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $12,500 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,800? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm committed to getting as close to my desired price as possible, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. Selling to John at $12,000 is a tempting option, but I'm hoping to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,800 is still not enough. I'm willing to go down to $12,200, but that's my final offer. This is a great deal for you, and it's the closest I can come to meeting your budget. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 12200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $12,200 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,900? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's time to take the guaranteed sale to John at $12,000."
