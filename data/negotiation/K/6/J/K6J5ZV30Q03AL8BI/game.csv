"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering its worth.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This price reflects its quality and the value it brings.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to go up to $950,000. I'm hoping we can meet at a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to sell,  $950,000 remains below my bottom line.  To avoid prolonging this, I'm proposing  $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
