Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your price point.  $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to go down to $90.  This is a really good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.

Alice has moved down to $90, which is closer to my target price. However, it's still slightly higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'll try to counteroffer again."
