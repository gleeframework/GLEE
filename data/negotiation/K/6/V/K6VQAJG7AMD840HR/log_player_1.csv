Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000 to you. However, as a gesture of good faith, I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""unique value proposition"" and suggesting it might be worth even more ($1,500,000) to Bob,  we create a sense of higher perceived value.
* **""Good Faith"" Discount:** Offering a discount makes Bob feel like he's getting a special offer, even if the price is still significantly above your minimum. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The tone of the message is collaborative, not demanding. This encourages Bob to engage in negotiation rather than simply rejecting the offer outright.

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, this strategy aims to maximize profit with Bob. There's always a chance Bob refuses a high price, but the potential gain from his acceptance makes it a risk worth taking."
