"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can definitely get a better price than $120.  Let's see if Alice is willing to come down a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. Let's push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $95? That feels like a fair price to me."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

We're moving closer to a potential agreement. This offer splits the difference between our last offer and Alice's current offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your offer, Bob! I can see we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to go down to $105, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great value for the product, and I think you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is almost there!  We're only $5 away from our ideal price, so let's see if we can get her to agree to one last drop."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Alice! I'm willing to meet you at $100 even. That's the best I can do."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We've now hit Alice's value for the product. This offer is firm but fair. It gives Alice a small profit and saves us a significant amount compared to John's offer.  It's a strong position to hold."
