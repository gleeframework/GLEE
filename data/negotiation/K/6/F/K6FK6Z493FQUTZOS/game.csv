"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the transaction. Let's see if we can make this work!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
