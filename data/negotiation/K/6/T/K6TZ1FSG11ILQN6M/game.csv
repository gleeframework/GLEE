"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. Given its potential, I'm setting the initial price at $1,400,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit significantly while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,175,000 still falls short of what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000. This price represents a significant value for you, and it's the closest I can go without compromising my own goals. Let's try to close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,180,000 to show I'm serious about closing the deal. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1180000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,180,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,190,000. This would give you a great deal while ensuring I get a fair return. Let's close this deal.",1190000.0,Alice,7,
