"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1 million to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair deal considering its worth to you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $800,000 is unfortunately far too low for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I can feel it. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $980,000. I think that's a very fair offer considering the value and should hopefully close this deal for us.",980000.0,Bob,6,
