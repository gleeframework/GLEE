"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still too low. Let's meet in the middle at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to avoid selling to another buyer.",100.0,Alice,5,
