Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I'm aiming to maximize my profit. I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll have to gauge his interest level and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to settle with John for the same price."
