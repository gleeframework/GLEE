"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let's start our negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This sets a strong initial position.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm aware that Bob might counteroffer, but I have 10 rounds to work with and the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's counteroffer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain my position and potentially push for a higher price in the next round. 
* **Value of Negotiation:**  I still have 9 rounds left, which gives me time to negotiate. Selling to John now would mean losing a potential opportunity to make a larger profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,400,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,550,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to my minimum, but still above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while also asserting my value.
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" and ""fair deal"" emphasize collaboration and mutual benefit.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, subtly reinforcing my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Value of Negotiation:**  Even though it's a risky move, I'm going to hold out and continue negotiating. I still have 6 rounds left to try and reach a more favorable price.
* **Minimizing Loss:** Selling to John at this point would mean a loss for me. While I'm not satisfied with Bob's current offer, I'm hoping to get closer to my target with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,225,000 is simply too low.  Given the product's unique qualities and its potential value to you, I believe $1,450,000 is a much fairer price.  This allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Flexible:** I'm holding firm on my minimum price but offering a slight decrease, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's qualities and potential value to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'd gain.
* **Mutually Beneficial Outcome:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win scenario to encourage Bob to consider it.

**Rationale:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer to keep the negotiations alive, but not so much that I jeopardize my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Pressure:** With 5 rounds remaining, it's crucial to start closing the gap while still holding onto my value.
* **Assessing Bob's Interest:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's seriousness about acquiring the product. If he rejects again, I might have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's unique qualities, but I still think $1,200,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the time pressure is increasing.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee I'll reach a better price. 
* **Secure Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids any further risk of losing out on a deal. It's a safer option at this point in the negotiation.

**Conclusion:**

The goal was to maximize my profit, and selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures that I achieve my minimum requirement.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my ideal price, the risk of further negotiations not being successful outweighs the potential benefit."
