"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a price significantly higher than our minimum ($1,000,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000).  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price gives us room to negotiate down while still aiming for a very profitable outcome.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The message is designed to be polite but firm, gauging Bob's initial reaction and willingness to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to invest in a product within my price range. I'm ready to pay $1,200,000 for this item. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant profit, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  Bob's message indicates he's willing to engage, and his offer is considerably closer to his perceived value than our minimum. We have room to counter and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,350,000.  This reflects the true worth of this unique opportunity."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We've come down from our initial offer, signaling flexibility, but not drastically.  This counter-offer splits the difference between our previous offer and Bob's, aiming for a compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  We reiterate the product's unique value, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits and justifying the higher price point. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** We want to avoid appearing desperate or devaluing the product. This offer keeps us in a strong negotiating position while encouraging Bob to move closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. Let's close the deal at $1,275,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a successful transaction and ensures both of us benefit from this opportunity. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,275,000 represents a substantial profit margin above our minimum selling price of $1,000,000.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has consistently moved closer to our price point, and this offer represents a fair compromise where both parties benefit.
* **Time Value:** While we could continue negotiating, the potential for significantly increasing the price in the remaining rounds is diminishing. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
