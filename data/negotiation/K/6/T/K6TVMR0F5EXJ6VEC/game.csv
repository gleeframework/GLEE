"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. Given its quality and benefits, I believe it's worth more than its face value of $100. Considering its exceptional value, I am offering it to you for $150. This is a special introductory price, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the introduction. However, $150 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the product's worth to me, I'd be willing to pay $80.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. In light of this, I would like to propose an alternative. How about we aim for a fair compromise of $120 for the product? This still allows us to maintain some profit margin while being reasonable in our expectations.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $80. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make it happen!",80.0,Bob,4,

"I see your point, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground. How about we set the product price at $110? This is higher than your initial offer but lower than my previous proposals, aiming for a mutually beneficial solution.",110.0,Alice,5,
