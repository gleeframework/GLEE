"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within his budget, he can likely do better by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This represents a significant saving for you and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  This would be a quick and easy deal for both of us. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  Since Bob has the option of buying the product from John for $1,000,000, it's in his best interest to take that option.  There's no guarantee that Alice will come down any further in price, and Bob doesn't want to risk losing out on a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
