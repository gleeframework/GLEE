Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000 vs. $1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if I started closer to his valuation.
* **Exclusivity:** Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value and might make Bob more eager to secure the deal. 
* **Justification:**  While brief, mentioning ""immense value"" and ""true worth"" subtly reinforces the high price without being overly aggressive.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims high, hoping Bob might be willing to pay a premium. 
* There's a risk Bob might find the offer unreasonable and walk away. However, having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net."
