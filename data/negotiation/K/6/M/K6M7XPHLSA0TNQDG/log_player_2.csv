Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $850,000. This price still leaves room for profit for both of us, and I believe it's a fair offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get the price down closer to your $800,000 target."
