"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $850,000. This price still leaves room for profit for both of us, and I believe it's a fair offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe we can close this deal quickly. Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Bob,4,
