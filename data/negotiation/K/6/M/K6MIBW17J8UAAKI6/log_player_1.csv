{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000:** This price is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but also leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and open to negotiation, giving Bob the impression that I'm willing to work with him. 

This strategy is designed to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** I am aiming for a higher price than John's offer.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  By leaving room for negotiation, I encourage Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Maintain control:**  By setting an initial price, I establish my desired price point and frame the negotiation in my favor."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, it's clear that Bob is firm on his budget.  

* **Risk:** There's a risk that Bob will walk away, but accepting his offer guarantees me a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.
* **Opportunity cost:**  By accepting, I can avoid the potential time and effort involved in further negotiation, which could lead to a higher price but also a higher risk of no deal at all. 

Considering these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most prudent decision."
