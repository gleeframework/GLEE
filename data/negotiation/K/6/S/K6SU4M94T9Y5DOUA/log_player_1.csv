Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $850,000?  This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground,  How about $825,000? This offer is fair to both of us and gives me a better return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000.  This is a strong offer, and it saves you time and effort in finding another buyer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and I'm starting to run out of time. I can sell to John for the same price right now, so it's the most efficient option."
