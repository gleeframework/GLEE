Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. This product is worth a lot to me, but I believe this price reflects its true value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me ($1,200,000). I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is still below what I need to make this sale worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the efforts we've put into negotiating so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can squeeze out a bit more.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, as I think there's still room for a better deal with Bob. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can push the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts in trying to find a middle ground.  $925,000 is still a little below what I need, but I'm willing to compromise one more time.  Let's close this deal at $940,000.  This price is a fair reflection of the value of the product, and it allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  I believe this is the best we can do, so let's finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 940000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, Alice, but $940,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $920,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the efforts we've put into negotiating so far. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.  He's unwilling to budge much further, and my counteroffers are starting to feel repetitive. While I'm disappointed I couldn't get closer to my desired price, it's time to cut my losses and secure the sale to John.  John's offer guarantees me a much more profitable outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
