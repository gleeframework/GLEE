"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it provides will exceed your expectations. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:**  I'm starting with a high price to create room for negotiation and ensure I maximize my potential profit. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value and the potential return on investment to make the price seem more palatable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates I'm open to discussing the price, making Bob feel like he's in control and more likely to engage. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I'm starting at a price point that's higher than John's offer, but still within a range where I could potentially make a decent profit. If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is a guaranteed $1,000,000, I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting Bob's offer carries a risk that he might walk away, but I'm willing to take that risk for a potentially higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  Considering the unique benefits this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects a significant value for you, and I believe it's fair considering the potential ROI. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000. This shows good faith and encourages Bob to continue negotiations.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm again emphasizing the product's value and potential return on investment to justify the price. 
* **Maintain Margin:**  The price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, allowing me to secure a profit.
* **Open to Further Discussion:** The message invites further negotiation, leaving the door open for a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob has moved closer to my minimum acceptable price, his offer of $950,000 is still below the $1,000,000 I could get from John. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  We are now in round 4, meaning I have limited time left to negotiate with Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob potentially falling through.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Given the limited time and the potential for Bob to continue offering prices below my minimum, I'm choosing the guaranteed profit from John."
