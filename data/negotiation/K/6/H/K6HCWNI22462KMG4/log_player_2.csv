Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like the way you think! Splitting the difference is a great compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I can do $125, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $125. Since you can get the product for $120 from John, it makes more sense to buy from John and save the extra $5."
