"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  I've priced it at $2,000,000, reflecting its high value and potential for your business.  Let's discuss this further. "", ""product_price"": 2000000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and to maximize potential profit. 
* **Optimistic:**  Bob's value of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum, so I need to start high and hope he sees some value in the product even if it's not worth my full minimum. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is friendly and leaves the door open for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to sell at such a huge loss. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown some interest by making a counteroffer.  I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **Time to counter:** I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground. "", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm reducing my price, but not by too much. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate.
* **Remaining firm:** $1,750,000 is still above my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the discount being offered.
* **Open dialogue:**  The message encourages further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,750,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum of $1,500,000, but it's still a bit too low.
* **Potential to close the gap:** I'm not ready to sell at his price, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. 
* **Counteroffer is my best shot:** I have a few rounds left, and I can make a final counteroffer to try and close the deal with Bob.
* **Risk of losing to John:** Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.  There's a risk that if I keep rejecting Bob's offers, he'll walk away, but I believe it's worth trying to negotiate a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one final concession. $1,450,000 is my absolute bottom line.  This price reflects the value of the product and my desire to work with you.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll accept it."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:**  I'm making a small concession by dropping my price to $1,450,000. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm close to my limit.
* **Clear Bottom Line:**  I'm stating that this is my absolute bottom line to make it clear that I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  I'm highlighting that this price is a fair compromise and reflects my desire to work with Bob.
* **Pressure to Accept:**  By stating it's my final offer, I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept before he potentially loses the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're approaching the halfway point of our negotiation rounds.
* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,300,000 is well below my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **John is a sure thing:**  I'm running out of time, and selling to John will guarantee me my minimum. 
* **Risk of Bob walking away:**  If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, there's a high chance he'll walk away.

**I'm choosing to sell to John to secure a guaranteed profit and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether.**"
