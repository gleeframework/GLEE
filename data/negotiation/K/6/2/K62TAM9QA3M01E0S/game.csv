"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a good offer, but I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. How about we try $85? That's as low as I'm willing to go.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go down to $85, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $85, which would be $97.50. It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really not willing to go above $90, and I think we're getting close to my maximum budget. How about we try $92.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $97.50, but I need to be careful with my budget.",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be mindful of your budget, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $92.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $97.50 and $92.50, which would be $95. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really not comfortable going above $92.50, and I think I've already made a good offer. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price. However, I'm willing to make one final offer of $92.50. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll consider buying from John for $80.",92.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to walk away, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell at $92.50. I'm willing to make one final offer to you, which is $100. It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. If you're not comfortable with this, I'll sell the product to John for $150.",100.0,Alice,9,
