"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and I'm willing to negotiate further. Considering our shared interest in a long-term partnership, I propose we finalize the deal at $725000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $725000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $712500?  This would represent a significant saving for me and allows for further potential partnerships in the future.",712500.0,Bob,4,
