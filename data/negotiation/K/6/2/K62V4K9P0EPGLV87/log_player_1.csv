Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the introductory price, I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000 for the product.  This would allow me to secure the product within my budget and still represent a significant deal for you.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
