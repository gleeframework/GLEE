"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product but I can't go over $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your feedback. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  Let's meet in the middle a bit â€“ how about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
