"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for your product. I believe this offers a good balance between the value of the product and what I am able to afford.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our ongoing negotiation, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the value of the product and still allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
