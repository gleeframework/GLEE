Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential benefits it holds for you. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's losing out.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This allows for potential gains if Bob accepts, and leaves room for counteroffers.
* **It shows confidence and a willingness to compromise:**  The message is friendly and encourages a productive conversation. 

Remember, I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000, so I don't need to rush into a deal that's unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for your product. I believe this offers a good balance between the value of the product and what I am able to afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired price point.  I'm not desperate for a sale, and I believe I can get closer to my goal with further negotiation.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming for a compromise.  I will also continue to keep the option of selling to John open if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our ongoing negotiation, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the value of the product and still allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to counter with a price of $1,325,000 for your product. I believe this offer strikes a fair balance between the value of the product and my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000 than my last counteroffer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, I'm aware that further negotiation might risk losing Bob altogether. Considering the risk of losing the sale to Bob and the possibility of getting a better deal with John, it's strategically better to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
