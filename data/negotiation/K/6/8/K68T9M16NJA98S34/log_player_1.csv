Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $80. While it's better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $100. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob with a price of $120. This is still above my minimum value of $100, but it's a compromise from my initial offer of $150. I hope this will encourage Bob to come up in his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum value of $100.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm not confident we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100."
