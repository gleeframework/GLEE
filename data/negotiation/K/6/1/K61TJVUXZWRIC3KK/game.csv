"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it allows you to make a good profit. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,200. This is a fair compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I'm willing to sweeten the pot by throwing in some additional features that will enhance the product's value to you.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's aim for a win-win solution here.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value to you and a reasonable profit for me. I'm willing to make one more concession to get to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm offering the product to you for $9,100, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9100.0,Alice,5,
