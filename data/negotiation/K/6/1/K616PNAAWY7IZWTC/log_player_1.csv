Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal, but I must respectfully decline. I am still firm on my original offer of $10,000. I believe this is a fair price given the value of the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly anchored at $10,000 and doesn't seem willing to budge.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result, and there's a risk Bob will try to drag it out further. Taking the guaranteed $10,000 from John is the best move at this point."
