"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
