"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell it to you for $92. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $92 is still a little too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $88.  This is a fair price for both of us.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $88. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92 and $88, which is $90. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
