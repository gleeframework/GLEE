Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target:**  I want to maximize my profit, but also understand that Bob values the product more than John. 
* **Offer:**  By offering $9,500, I'm leaving some room for negotiation, hoping to secure a deal closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  This offer balances the risk of Bob rejecting it (and potentially losing the deal to John) with the potential reward of getting a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  This keeps the negotiation moving and potentially allows me to get a better deal than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation:** I'm trying to find a middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's last offer.
* **Compromise:** $9,000 is a compromise, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but also maintaining a price that's closer to my target.
* **Potential Outcome:**  If Bob accepts this offer, it's a win for me.  If he rejects, I can either make a final counteroffer or sell to John as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance Bob might reject this offer, and I risk losing the deal to John if I continue negotiating.  The potential gain from another round is minimal compared to the risk.
* **Security:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale and ensures I get a better price than selling to John."
