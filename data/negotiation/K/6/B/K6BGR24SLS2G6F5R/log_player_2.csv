Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  While your valuation is fair, I'm confident this product offers significant untapped potential that justifies a higher price.  Would you consider $1,110,000?
