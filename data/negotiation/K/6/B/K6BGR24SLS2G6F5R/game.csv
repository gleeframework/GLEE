"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  While your valuation is fair, I'm confident this product offers significant untapped potential that justifies a higher price.  Would you consider $1,110,000?",1110000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,110,000 is still a bit higher than where I feel comfortable.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,080,000. I'm confident we can finalize this deal at that price.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and we're getting closer. However, I'm still hoping to come in a little lower. How about $1,085,000?
