"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm confident the product is worth this much to him, and I'm aiming for a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and meet halfway.  I believe this price is fair, given the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm feeling the pressure of the limited rounds,  I'm going to hold out for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired amount with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession, but it's still above my minimum. With only five rounds remaining, I want to signal my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only four rounds left, Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum. While I'm still hoping for a higher price,  the risk of not reaching an agreement is becoming too high. I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John and avoid the uncertainty."
