,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $11,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I can afford. Let's try $12,000. That's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
