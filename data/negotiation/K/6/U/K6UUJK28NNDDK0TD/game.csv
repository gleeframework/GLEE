"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it would be a significant asset to your portfolio. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm genuinely interested in the product, and I'm prepared to pay up to $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal considering the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still out of my range.  I'm confident that the product is valuable, but I can't justify going beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  However, the value of this product is firmly above $900,000.  I'm willing to consider $975,000 as my final offer. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's more than reasonable.",975000.0,Alice,5,
