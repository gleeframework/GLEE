{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a decent starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll be able to gauge his interest and adjust my price accordingly. I'm also keeping the option to sell to John open if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. By rejecting his offer and counteroffering, I can continue the negotiation and hopefully reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest!  $8,500 is a bit too low for me at this point. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I'm confident you'll find this product is worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,250 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum price. While I could continue negotiating, the chance of getting a much higher price from John is too good to pass up. It's time to secure the sale with John and ensure I get the value I'm looking for."
