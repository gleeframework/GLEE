"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. This is a great deal, as I could easily sell it to someone else for more. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product.  Alice's offer of $125 is above your maximum. It's better to reject her offer and buy from John for $100."
