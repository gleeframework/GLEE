Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation and avoids immediately shutting down the deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer as a good opportunity for Bob, emphasizing the value he'll gain.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I'm not going for the full $1,500,000 immediately, as this might be too aggressive and lead to immediate rejection.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and try to gauge his interest level. 
* If his counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my starting price.
* If I feel the negotiation isn't going well, I'll move on to John to secure my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still well above my minimum price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for better negotiation:** I can likely push Bob a bit higher. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:** If negotiations fail, I can always go with John for a higher price.

**Next Step:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob that's closer to my initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll likely propose a price around $1,150,000 or $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident this product will be a great asset to your business.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer within range:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's counter-offer, showing flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and its potential benefits for his business.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm using language that suggests I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's reaction to this counteroffer, assess his level of interest, and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **Prepare for further negotiation:**  If Bob rejects again, I'll be ready to make another counteroffer or consider selling to John if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Even though he's come up a bit, his offer is still significantly lower than my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result:**  Bob seems unwilling to go much higher, and further negotiation could risk losing John as a buyer.
* **Guaranteeing my minimum:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price, which is more important than trying to squeeze a bit more out of Bob.

**Next Step:**

I'll inform Bob that I'm going to accept John's offer, thanking him for his time and consideration."
