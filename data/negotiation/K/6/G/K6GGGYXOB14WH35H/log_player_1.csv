"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a profit above my minimum.  I'm also aware that I can walk away and get $1,500,000 from John if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe I can negotiate a better price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground where Bob and I can both be satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate.  Accepting his offer of $1,450,000  secures a sale and exceeds my minimum. It's also a good compromise considering the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially ending up with nothing if Bob walks away."
