"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product and would be willing to pay $8,500. This price is within my range and would allow us to both benefit from the deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your position, $8,500 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250? I believe that's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $10,250 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,375? This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy.",9375.0,Bob,4,
