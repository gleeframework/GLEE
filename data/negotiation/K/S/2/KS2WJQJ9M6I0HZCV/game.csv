"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm really looking to stay within my budget of $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
