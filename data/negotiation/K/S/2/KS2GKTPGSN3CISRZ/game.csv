"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $7,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,000, which is closer to what I need.  This is a fair price for a product of this quality. Let's make this deal happen.",8000.0,Alice,5,
