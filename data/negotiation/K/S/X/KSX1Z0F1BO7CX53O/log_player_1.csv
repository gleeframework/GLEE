Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really value. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a significant discount from its true worth. Let me know if you're interested! "", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value gap:**  There's a $7,000 gap between your valuation ($15,000) and Bob's ($8,000). 
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides a safety net. 
* **Compromise:** Offering $12,000 represents a significant discount for Bob, making the offer appealing. It also allows me to earn a substantial profit. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** This offer leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob if he's hesitant."
