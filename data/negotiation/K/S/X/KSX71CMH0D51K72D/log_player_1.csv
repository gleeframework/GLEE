Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $14,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I could be flexible if we can settle closer to $17,000. What do you think?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $17,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm firm at $12,000.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look elsewhere.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is firm at his valuation of $12,000 and unlikely to budge. Accepting his offer would mean selling the product for less than its worth to you.  It's time to cut your losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $15,000."
