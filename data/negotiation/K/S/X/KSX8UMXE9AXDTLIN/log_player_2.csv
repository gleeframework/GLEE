Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your budget and what John is offering. You should definitely counter-offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's important to start low. This leaves room for negotiation while still staying within a reasonable range of your budget and John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $110.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $105?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and you're already at the point where John's offer is a better deal. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
