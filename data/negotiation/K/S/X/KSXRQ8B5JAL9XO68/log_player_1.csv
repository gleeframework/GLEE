Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,750.  That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair return. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a little more, $10,500 is still a decent price and I'm not sure I can get him to budge further. It's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
