"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe $1,200,000 is a bit high. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This price is fair and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it doesn't quite reflect the value this product holds.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome and ensures a smooth transaction. Let's work together to reach a final agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This price is fair and represents a compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
