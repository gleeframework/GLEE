"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  This represents a fair price considering the value I place on it. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price point.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to accept $975,000. This is my final offer, as it's essential for me to receive a fair return on this product. I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
