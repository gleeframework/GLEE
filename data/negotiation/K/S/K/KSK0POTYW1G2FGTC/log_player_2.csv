"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

The product is worth more to Alice than to Bob, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price of $800,000.  There's still room to negotiate further and try to get a price closer to his budget."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price point.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to accept $975,000. This is my final offer, as it's essential for me to receive a fair return on this product. I believe it's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While $975,000 is still above his target price, it's close enough that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price. It's a win-win scenario: Bob gets a product he wants for a reasonable price, and Alice gets a sale that's closer to her desired value."
