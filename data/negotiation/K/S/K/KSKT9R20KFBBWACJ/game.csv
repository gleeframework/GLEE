"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank,  $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,900,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I value your interest, the gap between our positions is still a bit too wide.  I'd be willing to accept $1,850,000, but that's my final offer.  It represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for a product of this caliber.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
