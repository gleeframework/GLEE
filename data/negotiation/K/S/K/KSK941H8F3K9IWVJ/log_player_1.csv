Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $8,000 but also leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will find this price attractive, but I'm also prepared to counter his offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is still a good deal for me, especially considering I could sell to John for $8,000. I'm accepting to avoid potentially losing the sale entirely."
