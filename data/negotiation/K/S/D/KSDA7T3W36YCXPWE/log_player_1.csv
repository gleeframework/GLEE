Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price close to Bob's perceived value of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation but ensuring a good starting point for me.
* **Leaving Room:** This offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without immediately triggering a move to sell to John. 
* **Risk/Reward:** This approach balances the risk of losing Bob to the potential of securing a higher price than John's $10,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target Price:** My goal is to get as close to $14,000 as possible, and Bob's offer is still below that. 
* **Counteroffer Potential:**  Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.
* **Selling to John:** While John offers a guaranteed $10,000, I'm not desperate to sell immediately.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially secure a higher price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm adjusting my price down to $13,500, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** This counteroffer positions me in the middle between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500.
* **Increased Chance of Agreement:** This move increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer as it shows commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $13,500, and it's significantly higher than John's offer of $10,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  There's a good chance that Bob won't budge much further, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing him completely.
* **Securing a Profit:** Accepting this offer secures a decent profit for me while ensuring a sale.  Further negotiation may not be worth the potential loss of a buyer."
