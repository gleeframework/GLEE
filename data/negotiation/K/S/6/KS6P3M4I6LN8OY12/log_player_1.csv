"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,100,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to find a price that reflects the true value of this product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a lower offer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

This is a tough decision, but I think it's time to sell to John.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, I've reached a point where I'm concerned that Bob's counteroffers will continue to drop, and I might end up with a deal that's less than John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure the $1,000,000."
