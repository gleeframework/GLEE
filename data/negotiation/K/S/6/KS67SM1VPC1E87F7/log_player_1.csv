Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** $1,500,000 (You'll sell to John at this price if Bob declines).
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,400,000 leaves you with a significant profit margin above your reservation price while staying within a potentially agreeable range for Bob.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value, implying it's worth the higher price. 
* **No Urgency:** You don't want to appear desperate. Since you have John as a backup, you can afford to be patient.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how much you're willing to budge. Remember, any price above $1,500,000 is a win for you!"
