"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay the full asking price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's product is valuable, the $10,500 price is above Bob's $10,000 limit.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can secure the same product from John for a lower price."
