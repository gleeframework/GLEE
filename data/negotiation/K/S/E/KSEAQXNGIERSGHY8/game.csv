"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $180, which is a fair price considering its value.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal. While $60 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $140. This product is truly worth it, and I believe you'll find great value in it.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $140 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  I could go up to $70, but that's really the most I can do.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here, and I need to be upfront.  $70 is way too low for this product. I'm willing to let it go for $110, but that's my absolute final offer.  It's a fantastic deal for the value you're getting.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",90.0,Bob,6,
