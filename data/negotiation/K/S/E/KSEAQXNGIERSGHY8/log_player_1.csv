Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $140 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  I could go up to $70, but that's really the most I can do.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a significant jump from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing in very small increments. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering ($120).  Cutting my losses now and selling to John guarantees a fair profit."
