"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $900,000. This is a strong opening that acknowledges the product's value while also leaving room for negotiation. I believe Bob, knowing the product's worth to him, will be motivated to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, as there's still a chance to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering $850,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still reflects the product's value. I believe this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to consider while still leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price. There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially lose a sale.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product to Bob for $800,000."
