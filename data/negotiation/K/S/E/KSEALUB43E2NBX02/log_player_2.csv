"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a very attractive price of $1,700,000. It's a significant value proposition considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. It's better to reject the offer and buy from John for a much lower price."
