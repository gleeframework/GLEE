"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering a product that I believe holds significant value, and I think it could be a game-changer for your business.  I'm confident the price I'm proposing will be more than fair, but I'm also open to discussing it further.  Let's schedule a call to talk about the product in more detail.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is too expensive at $2,000,000, and I can get it from John for $1,500,000, which is a better deal.
