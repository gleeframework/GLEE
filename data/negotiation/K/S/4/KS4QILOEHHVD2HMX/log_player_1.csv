Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $10,000 to him, I'll aim to get as close to that as possible. I'll offer the product to Bob for $9,500.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still a decent price. Since I'm trying to maximize my earnings, I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer.

I'll increase the price by $250, making it $9,250. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway.
