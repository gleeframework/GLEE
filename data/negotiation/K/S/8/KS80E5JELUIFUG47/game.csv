"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer,  $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and it still allows you to get a valuable product at a competitive price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,315,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000. This is a small adjustment, and it could be our final compromise. Let's finalize the deal and move forward.",1320000.0,Alice,7,
