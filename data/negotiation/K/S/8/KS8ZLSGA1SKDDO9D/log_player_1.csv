"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify my initial price.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message makes it clear I'm open to discussion and willing to negotiate. 

This strategy allows me to maximize my earnings while also keeping the door open for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation,  $9,000 is too far below my desired earnings. 

I will counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground closer to my initial offer.  I still have time to negotiate with Bob and can always fall back on selling to John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's perspective:**  I'm showing I'm listening and understand his budget limitations.
* **Firm but fair counteroffer:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  It shows willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the deal as beneficial for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.

This approach continues to build rapport while keeping the pressure on Bob to raise his offer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10250. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell at a significant loss. 

I have 6 rounds left and will continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my target.  If I don't see a significant improvement in the next few rounds, I'll sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,250 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a little too far apart. Let's split the difference and aim for $10,375. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10375}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge progress:** I acknowledge Bob's movement towards my desired price.
* **Final offer:** I'm stating this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Split the difference:**  This strategy shows I'm willing to meet halfway while still maintaining a decent profit margin. 

This approach creates pressure on Bob to accept my final offer, knowing that I'm close to closing the deal with John if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $10375 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10200, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,200 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  We've reached a point where further negotiation seems unlikely to get me closer to my target. 

With only 4 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price than John's offer is too high.  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept."
