"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  However, $120 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in that price.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $90. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $80. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $80.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy right now if you're willing.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling at $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $85. It's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down to $85.  I'm still hoping we can close the deal at $80.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree.",80.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling at $80. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $87.50. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?",87.5,Alice,7,
