Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling at $80. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $87.50. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still unwilling to sell for my target price of $80.  Even though she's come down to $87.50, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking that she won't budge further.  I'm going to purchase from John for $80 to ensure I get the product at my desired price."
