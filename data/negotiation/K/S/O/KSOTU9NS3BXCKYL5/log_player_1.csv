"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can do better with some strategic negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  This gives you a good deal, and it's still a fair price for me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 925000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise. If not, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here. $850,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a good deal for both of us.  If you're serious about buying the product, let's meet in the middle.  I'm running out of time and John is waiting in the wings."", ""product_price"": 900000}
