{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to me, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This price is fair for both of us, allowing me to get a good deal and you to recover a significant portion of your value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $850,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I have 9 rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant concession on my end. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is still too low for me. While I want to close the deal, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with more negotiation. I have 6 rounds left to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us, and allows us to move closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to go up to $910000. This price is very close to your last offer and reflects a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away feeling satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $925,000,  $910,000 is a good price considering the number of rounds left. Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit, and I'm confident that I won't get a better price from Bob."
