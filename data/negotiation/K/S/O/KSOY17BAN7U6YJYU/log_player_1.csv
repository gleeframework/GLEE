Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get more than your minimum.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's reaction to this initial high price will give you valuable information. If he outright rejects it, you know you need to come down significantly. If he counters, you'll have a better idea of his price range.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 gives you leverage. You don't have to settle for anything less than that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. We started high, and he immediately went to his maximum value. By rejecting his offer and proposing a counteroffer, we can try to secure a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't quite let it go for $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $125, we are showing a willingness to negotiate and move closer to Bob's price point. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  This common negotiation tactic can feel fair to both parties, potentially making Bob more receptive. 
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:**  We're still significantly above our minimum acceptable price, ensuring a good profit if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** Bob's offer of $110 is a $10 profit over our guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further haggling might only yield a few extra dollars, and there's a risk Bob could walk away altogether.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and allows us to move on to other opportunities."
