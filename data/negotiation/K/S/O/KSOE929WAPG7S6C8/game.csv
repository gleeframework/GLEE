"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value I place on the product and your asking price.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,340,000. This is truly my final offer, as I'm already significantly below my initial asking price. If we can't reach an agreement at this point, I'll need to explore other options. ",1340000.0,Alice,5,
