Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $155? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155

``` 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $155 is a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of not reaching a deal at all."
