{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $12,000, but I'm also willing to negotiate. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll need to consider his counteroffer and the possibility of selling to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $9,500 is too far off. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I might need to consider other options. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
