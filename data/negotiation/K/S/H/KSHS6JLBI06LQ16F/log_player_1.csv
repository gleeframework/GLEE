Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming for a price slightly below that with Bob allows us to potentially secure a deal faster and avoid the risk of John changing his mind.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, but the message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" to create a sense of urgency and scarcity. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial offer leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down a bit, while still remaining above our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's an element of risk involved. If Bob is a tough negotiator or simply uninterested, we might miss out on the extra profit we could have made by going directly to John. However, this approach gives us a chance to maximize our potential earnings."
