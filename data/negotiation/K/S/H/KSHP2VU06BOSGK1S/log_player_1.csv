Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price. While I want to find a deal, accepting such a low offer would be a significant loss.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is considerably less than what I can accept.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. I'm getting closer, but $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $8,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
