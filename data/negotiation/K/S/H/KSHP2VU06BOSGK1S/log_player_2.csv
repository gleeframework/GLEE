"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. You should definitely try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than you're ultimately willing to pay. This gives you room to move upwards during the bargaining process.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is polite and expresses interest in the product, but it's also firm about your budget limitations.
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a number significantly lower than Alice's asking price, you're attempting to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to your desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is considerably less than what I can accept. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $14,000 is still significantly higher than both your target price and your alternative option with John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there's still room to bring the price down further. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping the option to buy from John for $8,000 in your back pocket gives you leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. I'm getting closer, but $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $8,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Reasonable:** You've now moved directly to your maximum price, making it clear what you're willing to pay.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""market value,"" you subtly remind Alice that you have other options and are aware of the product's worth.
* **Time Pressure:**  As you move closer to the 10-round limit, putting your best offer forward becomes more important."
