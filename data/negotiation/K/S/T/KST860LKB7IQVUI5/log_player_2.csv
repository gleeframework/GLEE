"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9500. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate with Alice and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a good deal for both of us, and it's a price that I believe is fair. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice has come down slightly, but she's still above Bob's maximum price.  He's better off going with the guaranteed price from John."
