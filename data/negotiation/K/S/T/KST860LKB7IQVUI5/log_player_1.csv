{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is likely to counter-offer, allowing you to potentially earn a higher price.
* **Is attractive to Bob:**  The price is still below what the product is worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to buy.
* **Protects your interests:**  The price is above your minimum acceptable value, ensuring you don't sell the product for less than what it's worth to you. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to spend closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to try to get closer to my target price of $10,000. I'll counter-offer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and it's a price that I believe is fair. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
