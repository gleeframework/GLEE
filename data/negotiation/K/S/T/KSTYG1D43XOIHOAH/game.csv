"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. It's important I get a fair return on my investment.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you given the value the product holds. Let's work together to find common ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.
