Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,150,000 is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).
    *  Leaves room for negotiation but still secures a substantial profit above my minimum.
* **Encouraging Engagement:** The message is framed positively, highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair reflection"" to make Bob feel valued and potentially sway him towards a deal."
