"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,500,000. It's a valuable asset with significant potential. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Setting the Tone:** My message is friendly and encourages further discussion. 
* **First Move Advantage:** I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and gauge his initial reaction.

**Important Note:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,200,000.  However, I'm hoping to get more from Bob.  I will use John as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for us to reach a mutually acceptable price.  
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, but still lower than my initial offer, to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 

I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I think I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1,300,000? I believe this price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm lowering my price from the previous round, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Value:** $1,300,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price and reflects the product's worth.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes a fair deal for both parties and encourages further discussion. 

I'm cautiously optimistic that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob. I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary, but I'm still hoping to avoid selling to John at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're already in Round 4, and I want to avoid losing valuable time with further negotiation.
* **Slight Gain over John:** While John is willing to pay $1,200,000, accepting Bob's offer nets me an extra $50,000.

Even though I would prefer a higher price, I believe it's wise to accept Bob's offer. It secures a good deal for me and avoids potential risks of further negotiations or selling to John."
