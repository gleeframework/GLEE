"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product truly offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?  This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to move forward with the transaction.",10000.0,Bob,4,
