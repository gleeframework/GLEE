"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob wants to start his counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to create room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** Bob is aiming for a price that still leaves Alice some profit, while also saving him a substantial amount.
* **Rationale:** The message includes a clear explanation for the counteroffer, emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product truly offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above target:**  While $10,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point of $9,500. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room to negotiate further, as Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Avoiding John:**  At this point, it's still more beneficial to continue negotiating with Alice than to buy from John at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?  This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price halfway between Alice's previous offer and Bob's last offer. 
* **Finality:** Bob is signaling that this might be his final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Alice.
* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a friendly tone, focusing on finding a mutually beneficial solution."
