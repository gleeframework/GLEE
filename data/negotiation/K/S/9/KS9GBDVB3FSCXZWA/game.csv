"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $750,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects both the product's value and our willingness to make a deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to get the deal done. I'm offering $775,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $775,000 is close, but I need to be a bit more conservative with my budget.  Would you consider $760,000? That's a firm offer, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.",760000.0,Bob,6,
