,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $90. How about we try $87.50? That's a bit closer to the middle, but still a good deal for me.",87.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $87.50 is close, but I need to get a bit more for it. Would you consider $89, and we have a deal?",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $89. How about we try $88? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",88.0,Bob,6,
