"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counter offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000} 
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value.  I believe this is a fair compromise and could be attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm not willing to settle for less than $15,000, which is what John will pay.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm coming down a bit further, but still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not willing to sell for less than my minimum value. I'll try to get a better price from him in the next round. I'm running out of rounds though, so I need to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum price but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize that we're close to a deal and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, and Bob still not willing to meet my minimum price, it's best to secure the sale with John. It's guaranteed money and I don't want to risk losing out on the deal completely."
