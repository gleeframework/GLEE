"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the quality and potential of what's on offer. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the response. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident this price represents a good deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $14,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to go down to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting close.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $11,000 is really the lowest I can go.  If you meet me at that price, we have a deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
