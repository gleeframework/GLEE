"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value this product holds.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
