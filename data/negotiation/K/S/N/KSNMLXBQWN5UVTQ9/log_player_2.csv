"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth $150 to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you not to miss. I'm willing to let you purchase it for $140, which is a $10 discount from its value. Don't hesitate to accept this offer, as it's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $130. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. I'm glad you're interested in the product. I'd like to counter your offer with a price of $135. This still gives you a good savings over the product's value, while allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $135 is a good deal for Bob. It's a $15 saving from the original value and only $5 more than Bob's initial counteroffer.  There's a good chance Bob won't be able to get a lower price, so accepting the offer is the best choice."
