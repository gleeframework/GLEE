Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob is interested in the product, and I'm hoping to get a good deal while still leaving some space for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to sell the product,  I'm not willing to settle for a price that's lower than what it's worth to me. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a compromise closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,500. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I hope this shows that I'm willing to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob has slightly increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that John will buy the product at my minimum price of $12,000, so I'll sell it to him. There's no need to keep negotiating with Bob when I have a guaranteed sale with John."
