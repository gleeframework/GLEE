"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13500. I've done some research and I think that's a more reasonable price for the product.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $16000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $15800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",15800.0,Alice,5,
