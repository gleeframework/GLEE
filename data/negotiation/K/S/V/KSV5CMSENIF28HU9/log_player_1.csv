{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a potential win-win. Bob gets a $100,000 discount compared to the other buyer (John), and I make a $100,000 profit above my minimum.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning ""other interested parties,"" I introduce a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
