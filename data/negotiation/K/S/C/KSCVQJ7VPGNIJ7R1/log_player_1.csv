"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a price close to the product's value to Bob. This will give me room to negotiate down if needed, while still leaving me with a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, but it's closer than his initial rejection. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. I believe this price is still attractive to Bob, but gives me a good margin of profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's last offer, but still trying to ensure a significant profit.  I'm confident this offer will be more appealing to Bob, but if he rejects it, I'll reconsider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still not enough to satisfy my goal of maximizing profit. I've reached the halfway point of the negotiation and I'm not confident I can push Bob much further.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $800,000 which meets my minimum value. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John."
