"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let me know what you think!",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $82 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $80?  I'm really interested in this product and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
