"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $105 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $115. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",115.0,Alice,5,
