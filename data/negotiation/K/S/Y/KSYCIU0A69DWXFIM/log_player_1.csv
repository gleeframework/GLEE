"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I have 9 rounds left and can potentially get a higher price.  I'm also aware that John is willing to pay $10,000, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,750. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still determined to get closer to my target of $11,500. I have 6 rounds left to negotiate and a guaranteed safety net with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,900, but I can't go lower. This is my final counteroffer, let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 10900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Alice, and I appreciate that. However, $10,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,800. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and considering I have only 4 rounds left, it's a good deal.  While I'd prefer a higher price, the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for $10,000 outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
