Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and the high demand I'm experiencing from other interested parties, I'm offering it to you first at the price of $1,750,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. Let me know your decision soon, as I have another interested buyer waiting."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting with a price of $1,750,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Sense of urgency and competition:**  Mentioning another interested buyer (John) creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Justification of price:**  While not explicitly stating Bob's exact valuation, alluding to the ""unique value"" and ""high demand"" subtly justifies the higher asking price.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged. If Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice can always negotiate down, knowing she has a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John."
