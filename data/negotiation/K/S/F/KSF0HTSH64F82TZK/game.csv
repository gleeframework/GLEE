"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $2,000,000 is still pretty far from what I have in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?  That's as high as I can go.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
