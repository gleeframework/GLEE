{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum. It leaves room for negotiation and encourages Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I am looking to keep my expenses within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value for the product, and there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,800. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and while I appreciate the reduction, I am still looking to stay within my budget of $8,000. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between at $8,600? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $8,600 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum and a better deal than selling to John for $10,000. It's a good compromise and worth accepting to secure the sale."
