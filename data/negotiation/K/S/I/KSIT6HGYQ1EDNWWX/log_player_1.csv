"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to get my minimum price, I'm not in a rush. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $200.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still above my minimum.  I hope this price is attractive enough for Bob, and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $160, which is closer to my initial asking price and definitely better than selling to John for $150. I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
