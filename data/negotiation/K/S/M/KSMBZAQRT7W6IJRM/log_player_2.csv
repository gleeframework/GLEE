Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering at $10,250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.
