"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. Let me know if you're interested!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to part with it for. Let me know if this works for you!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $9,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering at $10,250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",10250.0,Alice,5,
