"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is better than $1,200,000, you can still do better.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to your ideal price of $800,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is lower than Alice's previous offer, it's still not within your ideal price range. It's worth continuing to negotiate and potentially getting closer to $800,000. You have a strong bargaining position as you have a fallback option with John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's last offer. It shows you're willing to meet halfway, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement. You are still holding out for a better price than Alice's offer but are showing you are serious about making a deal."
