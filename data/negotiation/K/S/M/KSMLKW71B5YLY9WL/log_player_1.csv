Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it still leaves me with a good profit. It also leaves some room for negotiation, as the product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, I still have a good chance of getting a better offer from Bob or falling back on John's offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,050,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a good profit for me. It's also a reasonable offer that Bob might be willing to accept, as it's still below the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's still a significant discount, the risk of further negotiation could lead to a lower price or even a stalemate.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
