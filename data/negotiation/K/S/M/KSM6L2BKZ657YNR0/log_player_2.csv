"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe will greatly benefit you. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $1300000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is higher than her own value of $1,200,000. This indicates room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer is a strategic move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you see in this product.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To move forward, I would like to suggest a price of $1250000 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our positions and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still higher than her own value of $1,200,000, meaning there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price.  

We're still early in the negotiation process, and Bob has time to push for a better deal before resorting to buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This would be a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
