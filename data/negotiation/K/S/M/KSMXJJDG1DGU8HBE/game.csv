,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective on the value, the price of $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe to be fair. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true worth of this product and the potential it holds for your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
