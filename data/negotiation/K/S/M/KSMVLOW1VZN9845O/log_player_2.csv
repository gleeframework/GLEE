"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to make you a one-time offer on this exclusive product. I think you'll find it's a great value, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and it's a significant discount from its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
