"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1500000 is certainly a figure to consider, it doesn't fully reflect the unique value and potential of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. I believe this price remains fair and allows for both of us to benefit from this opportunity. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1600000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
