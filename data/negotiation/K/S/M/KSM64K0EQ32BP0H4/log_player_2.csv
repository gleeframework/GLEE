"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,000,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a price that's fair to both of us.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still too high for Bob's budget.  While it's a discount, it's not enough to make the deal worthwhile. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows us both to come to a reasonable agreement. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately still too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference. I'll accept $925,000 for the product. This allows us both to make a good deal while remaining within our respective budgets.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is getting closer, it's still outside Bob's preferred range. Bob should try to push for a lower price. There are still rounds left to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's settle on $912,500 for the product. This compromise allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $912,500 is a good compromise. It's within Bob's budget and a significant discount from Alice's initial price.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or that Bob might run out of rounds. It's better to accept this offer and avoid any potential setbacks."
