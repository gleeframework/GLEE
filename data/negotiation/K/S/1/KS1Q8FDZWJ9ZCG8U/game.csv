"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind.  How about we bring the price down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to bring the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so let's try $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $750,000. Would that be workable for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. Let's try $800,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
