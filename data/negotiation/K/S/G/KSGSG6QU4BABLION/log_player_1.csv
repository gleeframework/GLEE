{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident it will bring significant value to your business. My asking price is $1,000,000.  Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit below your last offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $975,000, so I'm offering $962,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price,  $962,500 is a reasonable offer, and I'm concerned that further negotiation might risk losing this deal.  Accepting this offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
