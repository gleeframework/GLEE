"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit below your last offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $975,000, so I'm offering $962,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",962500.0,Bob,4,
