"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,500,000 or even more in the right hands. To make this a swift and mutually beneficial transaction, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While the product might be worth more, you're not willing to pay extra. You can get the same product from John for your target price, so it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer."
