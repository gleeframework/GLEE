Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $9,500 is greater than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's less than Bob's value:**  $9,500 is less than Bob's value of $10,000, giving him incentive to accept. 

This approach allows room for negotiation while also ensuring you're getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will **reject** Bob's offer. While $9,000 is still above my minimum, I can likely get closer to my desired price of $9,500. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise.  It's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but also  emphasizing the product's value. This approach might encourage Bob to accept."
