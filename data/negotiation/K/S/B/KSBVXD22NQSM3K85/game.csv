"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective. While that price doesn't quite reflect the product's full value, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we settle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $950,000? This would be a fair compromise and allow us to finalize the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
