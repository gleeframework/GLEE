"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is a great opportunity to own a unique product, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $900000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925000. I believe the product's value is worth every penny, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $912500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",912500.0,Alice,5,
