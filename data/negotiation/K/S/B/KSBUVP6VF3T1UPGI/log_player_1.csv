Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Since Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation.  A starting price of $1,200,000 aims for a 50% profit margin. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value exceeds even Bob's known valuation, potentially justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer and find a mutually agreeable price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:**  Alice has limited information about Bob. If she knew he was a tough negotiator, she might start even higher.
* **Market Information:** Is there a chance someone other than John would pay even more? If so, Alice might risk a higher price with Bob.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Does Alice need to sell quickly? A tighter deadline might make her accept a lower offer."
