"I understand that you have a strong interest in the product, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1000000. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in this product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're close to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
