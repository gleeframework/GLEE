"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above what the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  We're aiming to get a price as close to Alice's value ($8,000) as possible, while still leaving some room for negotiation.  A $10,000 offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. 
* **Message:**  The message is polite and emphasizes the value of the product to both parties. It also leaves open the possibility of further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000 to make this deal work. This still gives you a good deal, considering the product is worth $15000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for further negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000.  I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal willingness to compromise and find a solution.
* **Maintaining value proposition:**  $10,500 is still significantly higher than what the product is worth to Alice, making it a good deal for her. 
* **Continuing the negotiation:**  The message remains polite and emphasizes a desire to reach an agreement."
