Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11000.  I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500?

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
