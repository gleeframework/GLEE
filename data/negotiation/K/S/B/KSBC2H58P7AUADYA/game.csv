"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000 to make this deal work. This still gives you a good deal, considering the product is worth $15000 to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11000.  I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
