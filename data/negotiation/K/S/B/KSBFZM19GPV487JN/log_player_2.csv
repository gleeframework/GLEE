"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product, valued at $150 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $140, a steal if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly inflating the perceived value of the product. While $140 is less than your maximum budget and John's offer, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're aware the product isn't worth that much and might be able to get it for a price closer to her actual valuation."
