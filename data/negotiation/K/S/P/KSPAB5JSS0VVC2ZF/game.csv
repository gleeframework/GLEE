"Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately far beyond my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify paying that much.  To start, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value to me, and it leaves room for us to negotiate a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product. While your offer is appealing, the price point doesn't reflect the true worth and potential return on investment. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant reduction and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
