{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($150) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see if I can get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I can potentially get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price above my minimum.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm willing to drop the price a little further, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I believe this counteroffer is fair and hopefully will be accepted by Bob."
