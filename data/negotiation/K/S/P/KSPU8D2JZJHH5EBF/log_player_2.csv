"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you're interested in! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Since Alice's offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay, there's no point in negotiating further. Buying from John at the same price saves me the hassle of negotiating."
