"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's worth to you ($150). It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $100? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget, but I can't go as low as $100.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is a good deal. It's still below your maximum budget of $150, and it's closer to your preferred price of $100.  There's no guarantee that you can negotiate further and get a lower price, so accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
