"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $100? That would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget, but I can't go as low as $100.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
