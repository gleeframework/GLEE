Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$120** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message** is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

This approach aims to start the negotiation at a favorable price for me while leaving room for potential counteroffers. If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my price based on his counteroffer or choose to sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $100? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John for $80, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe the product is worth more than $100 to Bob, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget, but I can't go as low as $100.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $110, which is halfway between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $100. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints but reiterate the product's value to him. I frame $110 as a compromise that benefits both of us.

This approach aims to find a middle ground and show that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value."
