# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering the value it brings.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise where we both benefit.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise here. I've tried to be flexible, but $1,075,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,090,000. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options for selling the product.
