I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me while also allowing for a reasonable profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
