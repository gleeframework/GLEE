{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth $10,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $12,000. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price before buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, as I want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  I'm offering $9,000, which is still a decent profit for her, but significantly lower than her initial offer."

Alice has lowered her price, which is good, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to keep the price below $10,000."

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
