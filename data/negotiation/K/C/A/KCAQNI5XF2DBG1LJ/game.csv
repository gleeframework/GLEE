"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about $100? I'm willing to split the difference a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to keep the price as low as possible. How about $85? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you want a good price, but $85 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $95? This would be a fair compromise and allow us to both come to an agreement.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure we're going to meet in the middle again, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $92 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $97, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to go higher, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer.",97.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $97, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $91? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",91.0,Bob,8,
