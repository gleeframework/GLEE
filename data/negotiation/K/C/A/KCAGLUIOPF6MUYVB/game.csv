,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $110 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $105 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $105 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $95. If you're not able to go that low, I might have to look at other options.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $102.50 for the product. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still closer to my previous offer of $95. How about we meet in the middle at $98.75? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",98.75,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $98.75. I can do $100 for the product, and I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,7,
