"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a decent price, it's still above your personal value of $100. You can likely negotiate a lower price, and you have 10 rounds to do so.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but still above her value of $80. It shows you're serious about buying but are trying to get the best price.  This should open the negotiation and hopefully lead to a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $85.  Would you consider $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $90 is still higher than your value of $100, but is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate.  It's worth continuing to bargain for a better price, as you still have 7 rounds remaining. You can use this remaining time to try and get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? It's still a fair price for both of us, and it'll help us move closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($90) and your previous offer ($85). It shows you're willing to be flexible and find common ground, while still keeping your negotiation within your budget.  This should increase the likelihood of Alice accepting your offer and finalizing the deal."
