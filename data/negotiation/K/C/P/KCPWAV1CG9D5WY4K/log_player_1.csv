{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is still higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This allows for some wiggle room during negotiations.
* **It's a strong initial offer:**  It shows you're serious about selling, but also willing to negotiate. 

I'll be watching how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is still a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal. I believe there's still room to reach a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product and appreciate your counteroffer.  While $8,500 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,000?  This would still give me a reasonable return on my investment, and hopefully it's a price you're comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 
 
**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price above my absolute minimum.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for the price, highlighting my investment and the value I see in the product.
* **Openness:** I conclude with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to continue the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I pay $8,750?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I believe there's still room to negotiate and reach a price closer to my value of the product. 
Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Would you be willing to go up to $9,250?  This would be a fair compromise, ensuring a reasonable return for me while still being a good price for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  My counteroffer reflects a slight increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my commitment to getting a fair price, but it's still lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Compromise:**  I propose splitting the difference between our last two offers, making it a  ""fair"" compromise in my eyes. 
* **Open-Ended:**  I end with a question to keep the negotiation open and encourage Bob to consider my offer."
