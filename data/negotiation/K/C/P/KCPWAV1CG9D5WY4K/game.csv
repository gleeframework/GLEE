"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is still a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product and appreciate your counteroffer.  While $8,500 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,000?  This would still give me a reasonable return on my investment, and hopefully it's a price you're comfortable with.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I pay $8,750?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Would you be willing to go up to $9,250?  This would be a fair compromise, ensuring a reasonable return for me while still being a good price for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9250.0,Alice,5,
