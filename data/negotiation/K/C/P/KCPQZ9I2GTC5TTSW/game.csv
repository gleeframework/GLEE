"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $15,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $13,000 is better, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're willing to negotiate, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, but I can meet you halfway between $13,000 and $11,000. How about $12,200? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you.",12200.0,Alice,5,
