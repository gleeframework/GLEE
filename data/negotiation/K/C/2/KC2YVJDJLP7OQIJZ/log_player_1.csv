Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's value but still gives me a good profit.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a price that's closer to $100, but I'm willing to sell to John for $80 if Bob doesn't accept my offer.  This strategy balances the risk of losing the sale with the possibility of getting a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, hoping to meet him halfway. I'm still confident that I can get a higher price, but I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
