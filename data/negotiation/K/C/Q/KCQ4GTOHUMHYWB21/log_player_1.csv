Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and reflects the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum.  While I'm not getting my ideal price, I can likely get closer to $1,100,000 with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still confident this price reflects the value of the product. It's a good compromise that should be acceptable to Bob while still giving me a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and while I'm running the risk of losing him as a buyer, I'm willing to risk it and try for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

This offer is a bit closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this is enough to persuade him to agree, while still getting me a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not going to budge on his offer, and I'm running the risk of getting nothing if I keep rejecting him.  While I'd prefer more, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely, and John's offer is at least within my minimum acceptable range."
