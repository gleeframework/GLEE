Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still too much for me. I'm really only comfortable paying $90. If we can meet in the middle, I'm happy to close the deal.

You have three options:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to be flexible, but I'm still only willing to pay $95. It's closer to my budget, and it's a fair compromise. If you're not willing to meet me halfway, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $95.  While I could continue negotiating, it's not worth the risk of him walking away entirely.  Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
