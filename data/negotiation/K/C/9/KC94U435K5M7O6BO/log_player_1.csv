{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited about the potential of this product in your hands. I'm offering it to you for $950,000.  This price reflects its value and allows for a significant return on your investment.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your initial price point, $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still allows me to meet my minimum target while acknowledging the value you see in the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While $775,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It's clear that Bob and I are too far apart in our valuations, and further negotiation would likely be fruitless.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000."
