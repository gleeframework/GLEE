"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your initial price point, $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still allows me to meet my minimum target while acknowledging the value you see in the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
