"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,900,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the product holds significant value beyond $1,400,000.  I could consider letting it go for $1,700,000.  This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
