"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $10,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
