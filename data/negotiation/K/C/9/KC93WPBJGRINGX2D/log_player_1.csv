Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can bring to the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $950,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate him up but be ready to walk away and take John's offer if needed."

How about we meet at $1,050,000? This reflects the value I bring and allows room for a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $1,050,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll propose $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While not ideal, $1,025,000 is a reasonable compromise, exceeding my minimum threshold and avoiding the risk of losing both offers."
