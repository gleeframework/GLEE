Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know you'll find it valuable, and I'm willing to part with it for $17,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 17000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $17,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Urgency:**  Adding a time constraint might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially accept the higher price.

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, you haven't lost anything. You still have your guaranteed sale to John at $15,000."
