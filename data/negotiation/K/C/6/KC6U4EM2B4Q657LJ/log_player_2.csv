"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While $9,500 is a good price, Bob can potentially get it for even less. It's worth exploring further negotiation rounds to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He's starting with a slightly lower counteroffer, hoping to test Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,700 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's desired price point, and he's already had two rounds of negotiation.  There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to Alice rejecting his counteroffers, and he might end up having to buy from John for a higher price.  It's more strategic to accept this offer and secure the product for a decent price."
