You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation.  He should try to get a lower price from Alice."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than her first offer, he can still get it for $8,000 from John, so there's still room for negotiation with Alice."

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice has stated this is her final offer and it's still higher than what Bob can get the product for from John. Bob has already made several counteroffers and it is unlikely Alice will come down further.  It's time to move on and get the product from John."
