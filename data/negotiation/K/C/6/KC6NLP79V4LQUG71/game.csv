"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, which is still a good compromise for both of us. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,5,
