"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,500?  That's still a great price for a product worth $15,000 to me.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,9500.0
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we meet at $10,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, we're getting closer!  I see your point about $10,250.  How about we try $10,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it would give you a great deal on a high-quality product.  Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,750. That's the highest price I'm willing to pay for this product.",9750.0,Bob,6,,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for my product. I'm willing to come down to $9,900 as a final compromise. This is a great opportunity for you, and it's also a price that allows me to move forward. Let's make this happen!",9900.0,Alice,7,,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,750 one last time. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9750.0,Bob,8,,
