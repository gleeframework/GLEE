Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly below the product's true market value and potential for your business.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is a fair offer considering its unique advantages.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we need to be realistic about the value this product offers.  I'm open to finding a solution, but I can't go lower than $1,550,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $1,550,000, which is still considerably higher than John's offer of $1,200,000.  It makes more financial sense to buy from John and secure the best possible price."
