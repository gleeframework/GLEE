"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum price of $15,000, so accepting it would be a loss for you.
* **You can do better.** Since you have a backup option (John), you're in a good position to negotiate with Alice. Rejecting her offer allows you to propose a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer below your max:** My offer is still within your budget and leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Fair starting point:** $12,500 is a reasonable starting point, considering Alice's minimum selling price is $12,000. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  By offering a price slightly higher than Alice's minimum, I'm signaling that I'm serious about buying the product while still leaving space for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference at $13,250? That way, we both get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget.**  $13,250 is below your maximum price of $15,000.
* **Good compromise:**  Alice has moved closer to your offer, and this price represents a reasonable compromise.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While accepting this offer is the best option at this point, there is still room to negotiate further if you choose to reject it. However, considering John's price, it's unlikely you'll be able to get a better deal."
