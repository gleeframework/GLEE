"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if I don't reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm offering $1,300,000, which is still above my minimum price, but shows I'm willing to be flexible and come down from my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below it. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer again. I'm still optimistic that I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering $1,250,000, which is only $50,000 above my minimum price. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also not willing to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer again. I'm still hoping to get a better price, but I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if I don't reach an agreement with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1220000}

I'm offering $1,220,000. This is only $20,000 above my minimum price and shows Bob I'm getting close to my limit.  I think this is a good compromise that might make Bob willing to close the deal."
