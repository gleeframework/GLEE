"Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure the price is right for my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that you're looking to negotiate, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I have to consider my own needs and goals. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high. How about $1,100,000? I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident that we can finalize the deal at this point.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm offering you a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
