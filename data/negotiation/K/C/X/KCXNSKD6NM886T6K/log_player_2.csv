I'm going to reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better price.  Since I'm willing to pay $150, there's no reason to buy from John right away.  Let's see if I can negotiate with Alice!"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Alice $120. This is a significant discount from her initial price and hopefully will get the negotiation started."
