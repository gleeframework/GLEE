"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer of $9,500 is below my maximum budget of $10,000.  There's no guarantee I can get a better price, even with counteroffers."
