"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob ($8,000) to see if I can get a good starting point. I'm also trying to be friendly and positive in my message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work out a better deal. I am willing to pay up to $8,500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price of $8,000, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
``` 
I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's counteroffer but still a bit higher.  I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still keeping the price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given this some thought and I'd like to offer $8,600 for your product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more, Bob's offer is close to my minimum price and he's stated it's his final offer.  There's a risk that he'll walk away if I reject it, and I don't want to risk selling to John for a lower price."
