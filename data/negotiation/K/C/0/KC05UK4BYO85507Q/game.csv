"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $12,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let's find a way to make this work!",11000.0,Alice,3,
