"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot more to you than it is to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above Alice's valuation of $8,000. This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $12,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let's find a way to make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $11,000 is still within Bob's budget of $15,000 and significantly lower than John's price.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the difference between $11,000 and $10,000 is only $1,000.  The risk of going back and forth with Alice could lead to her walking away or Bob ending up paying more.
* **Time:**  Continuing negotiations could drag things out, and Bob may not want to risk losing the deal entirely.

Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price within Bob's budget and minimizes the risk of a lengthy negotiation."
