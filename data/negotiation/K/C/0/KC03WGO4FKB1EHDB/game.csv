"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $11,500 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement on this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
