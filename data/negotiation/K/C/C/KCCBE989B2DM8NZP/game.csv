"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, my budget allows me to pay no more than $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
