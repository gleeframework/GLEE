"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This reflects a fair price that would be mutually beneficial. I'm confident this can be a win-win situation for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle a bit? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while still being a good deal for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,175,000. I'm prepared to move forward at this price.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
