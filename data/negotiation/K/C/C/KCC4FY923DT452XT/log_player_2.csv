"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her value for the product, but it's still higher than my ideal price.  I can likely negotiate a better deal by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer."

# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle a bit? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while still being a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I still have room to negotiate. I want to get as close to $1,100,000 as possible.  I'll reject her offer and see if I can bring her down further."
