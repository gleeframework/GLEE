Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which still gives you a good price while ensuring I can cover my costs. What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try $92.50. That's a good compromise, and it gives us both a fair deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
