"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, attempting to maximize profit while still being within a reasonable range for Bob.  It leaves room for negotiation, but is above Bob's perceived value,  giving me leverage.  It also includes a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $80. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum threshold of $120. I'm not willing to sell at such a loss, and I have a backup option in John. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which still gives you a good price while ensuring I can cover my costs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum threshold, it's still not enough to meet my desired profit. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob in the hopes of reaching a more favorable price, but I'm also aware that I have a backup option in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try $92.50. That's a good compromise, and it gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm still trying to get closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $91? I'm sure we can find a way to make this work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $91 is still below my desired profit margin, it's getting closer to my minimum threshold. With only four rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll be able to achieve a higher price with Bob. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and prevents me from potentially losing out on a deal with John if I keep rejecting offers."
