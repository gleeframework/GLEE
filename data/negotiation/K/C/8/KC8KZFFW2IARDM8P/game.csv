"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $9,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal here.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,250 is close, but I need to get at least $10,000 for this.  If you're able to meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal today.",10000.0,Alice,5,
