"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is offering a ""good deal"" compared to the product's value to you, it's still more expensive than buying from John.  You can save $100,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
