,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $125. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $120. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know if you're interested.",120.0,Alice,5,
