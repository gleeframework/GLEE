,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $140 for it.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $140 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $160.  I'm still not quite there yet, but I can go up to $155.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $155 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $165, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can make a deal.",165.0,Alice,5,
