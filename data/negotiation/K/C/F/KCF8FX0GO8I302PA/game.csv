"Alice,  $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Given my budget, I'd be willing to offer $14,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there.  $17,000 is closer, but I'm really hoping to stay under $15,000.  Would you consider $15,500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
