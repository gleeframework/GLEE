Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits you'll reap."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price slightly below our guaranteed sale price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to further justify the high price.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. We can always decrease the price slightly, but we cannot increase it beyond this initial offer.

This strategy prioritizes getting the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging the security of John's offer as a fallback."
