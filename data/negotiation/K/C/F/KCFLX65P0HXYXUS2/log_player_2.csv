"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which I'm sure you'll find to be a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

While Alice's offer is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. John offers the product for $1,000,000, and there's room to negotiate with Alice since her offer is quite high. By rejecting this offer, you might incentivize Alice to propose a lower price, saving you even more money."
