"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price point of $80.** 
* **You have the opportunity to negotiate a lower price.** 

It's always best to try and negotiate, especially when you have a clear alternative like buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, my budget is $80. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 80}
