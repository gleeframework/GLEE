"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to keep some margin for profit.  Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to keep some margin, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's the best I can do.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle at $1,025,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and your budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
