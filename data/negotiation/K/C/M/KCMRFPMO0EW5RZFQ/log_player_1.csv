Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to start by asking for my full value, $1,200,000.  This is the best possible outcome for me and puts the pressure on Bob to negotiate. I know I have a backup buyer in John, so I can afford to be a bit firm."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close, but I can do better. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000.  This is a compromise, but it still gets me closer to my desired price. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. We've been through a few rounds of negotiation, and while Bob is getting closer to my asking price, it's clear that he's not willing to meet me in the middle.  John is a guaranteed sale at my full asking price, so it's the best option at this point."
