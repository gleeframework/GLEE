"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value and the benefits it offers, we believe it's worth $15,000. Considering its high quality and the impact it can have on your business or personal endeavors, I think this price aligns well with its true worth. Would you be interested in discussing further how this product could potentially enhance your situation? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting at her maximum price. While her message is friendly and emphasizes value, it doesn't give you any room to negotiate a lower price.  You can do just as well buying from John for $15,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might prompt her to offer a lower price in a subsequent round."
