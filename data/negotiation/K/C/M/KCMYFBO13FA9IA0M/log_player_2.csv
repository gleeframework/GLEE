"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  There are still 9 rounds to negotiate, and I can use this time to try and drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is still a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not ready to accept it. I have several rounds left to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $875,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $887,500. This is still a very good price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $887,500, which is very close to my target of $850,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sensible decision."
