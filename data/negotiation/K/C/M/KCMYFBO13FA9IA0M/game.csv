"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is still a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $875,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $887,500. This is still a very good price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.
