"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $180 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $120 for the product. Can we talk about a price in that range?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $90 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $110, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let's try to close this deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $110, and I'm starting to think we're getting close to a stalemate. I'll make one final offer: $105. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",105.0,Alice,7,
