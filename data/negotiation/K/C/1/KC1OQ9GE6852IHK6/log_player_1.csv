Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $140 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up, getting you closer to your maximum potential profit.
* **Appear Reasonable:** While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, framing it as a ""willingness to offer"" might make him more receptive than a very high starting price. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject this offer. However, the potential for earning an extra $10 before going to John makes it a risk worth taking."
