"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really like it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $120. You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $100. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $110?  That seems fair considering what we both want."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think $110 is a bit low, Bob. I can do $125, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is better than Alice's initial offer, you can still try to do better. It's still a good deal to buy from John, so you're in a strong negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $125 is still a little high for me though. Let's meet in the middle at $115. I think that's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can do $120, which is just $5 more than your latest offer. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's better to accept Alice's offer.  You've already been able to negotiate her down from $125 to $120, and you're getting the product for $30 less than John's price. It's unlikely you'll be able to get a better deal with Alice, and it's not worth risking her walking away and going with John."
