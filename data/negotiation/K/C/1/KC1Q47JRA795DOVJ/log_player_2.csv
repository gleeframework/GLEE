# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm starting with an offer price of $20000, which I believe is fair considering its value. What do you think?

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.
