"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm starting with an offer price of $20000, which I believe is fair considering its value. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $17000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can we meet in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,4,
