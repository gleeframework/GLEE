"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer you $9,500 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your valuation and well within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget, so I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'll meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair price that's closer to your budget and still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I can justify right now.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that's significantly closer to my budget, and still allows you to make a decent profit.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'll offer you the product for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
