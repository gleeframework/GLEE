You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her, it's still lower than what you would pay John. This means accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000, even though you could get a lower price from John."
