{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, there's still room to negotiate and potentially save more money. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it's still within my budget. I'm aiming to find a middle ground that is beneficial for both of us. If Alice is willing to negotiate, I believe this counteroffer will encourage her to come down on her price."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay right now. There's still room for negotiation, so I'm going to reject her offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,300,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still staying within my budget.  It's a reasonable middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. Hopefully, Alice will see the value in closing the deal and accept this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my maximum budget, but it's still not a price I'm willing to accept.  Since I'm getting close to my limit, I'm going to go ahead and buy the product from John for $1,200,000.  This ensures I get the product at the best price and avoids further negotiation that may not lead to a successful outcome."
