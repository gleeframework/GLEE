"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is my best offer, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,000,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'll make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting a little tight for me.  $1,050,000 is the best I can do.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,150,000. I'll offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
