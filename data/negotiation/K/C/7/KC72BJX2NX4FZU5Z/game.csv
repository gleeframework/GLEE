"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $8,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position. How about we split the difference and settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, let's be realistic. I'm not going to go below $8,000.  This product is worth significantly more to you, and $8,000 is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
