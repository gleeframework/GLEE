Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $8,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm not going to go below $8,000.  This product is worth significantly more to you, and $8,000 is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000

Alice has reached her lowest acceptable price. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a price lower than John's offer and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
