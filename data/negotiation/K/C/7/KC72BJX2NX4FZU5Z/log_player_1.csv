Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $7,000 because it's too low. I'm not willing to sell below my minimum of $8,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $8,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $7,750. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $8,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
