"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $80?"",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim for significant savings:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($80) aims to maximize potential savings, especially considering our $100 maximum.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  This offer leaves room for negotiation and allows Alice to counter without immediately dropping to our absolute limit.
* **Polite and interested tone:** Maintaining a positive tone helps foster a good negotiating environment, potentially increasing the chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $100, and that's the lowest I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our target price of $100. There's no point in rejecting and risking losing the deal, as John also offers the product at this price. Accepting now ensures we get the product at our desired price."
