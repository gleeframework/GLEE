"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. You have a better option with John, so it makes sense to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $10,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you, and I think you'll still get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. Since you have a guaranteed deal with John for $8,000, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than the guaranteed price of $8,000 from John. You've already rejected several offers and negotiated with Alice, demonstrating your willingness to bargain.  However, it's clear that Alice is not willing to go lower than $9,250. Therefore, buying from John offers you the best value and certainty."
