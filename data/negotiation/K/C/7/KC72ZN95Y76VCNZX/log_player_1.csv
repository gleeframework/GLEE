Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $900,000 is certainly a strong offer, I believe this product's value justifies a higher price point. Would you consider $1,050,000? This allows us both to move closer to an agreement."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're still valuing the product highly, but I'm trying to find a sweet spot where we can both be happy. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good offer, we're still early in the negotiation.  Bob is clearly interested, and there's room to negotiate further for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000?  This feels like a fair price that reflects the product's true worth."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has presented his ""final offer."" While we could push for more, the risk of him walking away and losing the deal is significant at this point. Accepting $975,000 secures a substantial profit above our minimum."
