Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to settle for $1,000,000 yet. I'll counteroffer and see if I can push him a little higher."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and while I'd prefer to get closer to $1,200,000, securing a sale at $1,150,000 is a good outcome at this point."
