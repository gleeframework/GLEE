# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer. It's above your maximum budget, and you can get the same product from John for less.  The next step is to make a counteroffer to Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still leaves a fair profit margin for me, while allowing you to get a great product at a reasonable price.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your desired price point.  Since you can get the product from John for $8,000, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option for now. You should counteroffer Alice with a price closer to your target."
