"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still leaves a fair profit margin for me, while allowing you to get a great product at a reasonable price.  Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $8,200? This is a fair price that allows me to stay within my budget and get the product I need. What do you say?",8200.0,Bob,4,
