Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price.  However, it's still a good price considering my minimum value for the product is $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,000, which is still above my minimum value. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but it also keeps the price relatively high. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. While I could continue to negotiate, I'm not confident that I can get him to meet my price. Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum profit requirement."
