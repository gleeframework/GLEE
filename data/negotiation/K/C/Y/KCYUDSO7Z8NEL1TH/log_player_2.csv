"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a fantastic deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of:

* **A counter-offer:** Alice might be willing to lower her price to secure the sale.  
* **Sticking with John:** You haven't lost anything and can proceed to buy from John at your maximum budget.

There's a chance to save at least $500, so it's worth seeing if Alice will negotiate."
