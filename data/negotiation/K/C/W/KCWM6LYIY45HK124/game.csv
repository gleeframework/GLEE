"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. The product is worth more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see its full potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet somewhere in the middle again?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, and I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. However, $950,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable investment.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can we compromise on this amount?",975000.0,Bob,6,
