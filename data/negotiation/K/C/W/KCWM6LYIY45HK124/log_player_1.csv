"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to go with his $900,000 offer, I believe I can get a higher price with more negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. The product is worth more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see its full potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet somewhere in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While his offer is closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push him closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, and I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. However, $950,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable investment.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can we compromise on this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob is clearly unwilling to budge on his price, and I've reached the point where the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of not getting a deal at all. I'm comfortable with John's offer, and it's better than risking a long negotiation that might end with no sale."
