Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters with a lower price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer will give me an idea of how interested Bob really is in the product and what his perceived value might be. 
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm ready to counter with a lower price or to walk away and sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Lowball Offer:**  $15,000 is my absolute minimum, but I'm not desperate to sell at this price. 
* **Room for Improvement:** I believe there's a chance I can get a higher price.  
* **Test Bob's Interest:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm testing his commitment to buying the product. If he's truly interested, he'll likely counter with a higher price in the next round. 

**Next Move:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer that is slightly higher than $15,000, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering $17,500, which is halfway between my initial offer of $20,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $15,000.
* **Showing Flexibility:** This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Testing Bob's Limits:** I'm curious to see if Bob will accept this price or if he'll counter with a lower offer again. If he counters again, I'll need to decide whether I'm willing to lower my price further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Goal:**  $16,000 is very close to my initial target price. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I could try to squeeze out another $1,000, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'd be left selling to John for $15,000. 
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could drag the process out, and I'm willing to settle for a slightly lower price to secure the sale quickly."
