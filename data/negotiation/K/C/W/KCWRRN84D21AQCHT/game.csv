"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but given the value of our product, I'm unable to lower the price below $15,000. However, I'm willing to discuss additional terms or benefits that might make the transaction more appealing to you.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, thank you for your persistence. After careful consideration, I am willing to negotiate the price down to $12,000.

Please let me know if this is something you would consider.",12000.0,Alice,5,
