"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. How about we split the difference a little more? I'm willing to go up to $7,000.  That's a significant increase from my last offer and gets us closer to a deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
