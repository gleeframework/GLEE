Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

We're getting closer, but we can still try to negotiate a better price than $8,500 before resorting to John's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. How about we split the difference a little more? I'm willing to go up to $7,000.  That's a significant increase from my last offer and gets us closer to a deal."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000

Alice has met your maximum price. There's no point in trying to negotiate further or going with John, as they both offer the product at $8,000."
