Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) without going below your minimum ($120).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 is a strategic move. It's just below your minimum, maximizing potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **Backup Option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John willing to buy it for $120, ensuring you don't lose out.

This approach balances maximizing potential profit from Bob while having a safety net with John's offer."
