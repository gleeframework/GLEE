Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $175.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $150. This gives you a starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** Offering the product at $175 allows for a $25 profit margin if Bob accepts. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While you have a backup buyer, starting with a slightly higher price leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, still landing you above your minimum. 
* **Clear and Concise Communication:** The message is straightforward and highlights the potential value for Bob."
