"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This is still a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great opportunity to get a valuable product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,750. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, $10,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,900, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal and make it happen.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,900. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",10800.0,Bob,6,
