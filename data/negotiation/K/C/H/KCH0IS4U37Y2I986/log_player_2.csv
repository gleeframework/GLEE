"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to earn a significant amount while also giving you a substantial discount on its true value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good discount, you can likely do better. You have a higher maximum price point than Alice's minimum.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives you the chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would still give you a good profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows you to get a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It's still lower than what you would pay to John and is closer to your target price. Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product at a reasonable cost."
