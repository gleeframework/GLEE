Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves some room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his minimum. I'm also trying to build rapport by highlighting the potential value for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $9,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have 9 more rounds to try to negotiate a better price with Bob, and selling to John is still an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives you a good deal, and hopefully, we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm still holding a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but closer to his offer, giving him a reason to consider. I'm also emphasizing the potential value and a good deal for him."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I have several rounds left to negotiate, and I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe there's still room for improvement with Bob."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is closer to what I'm hoping for.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $11,250.  This would give you a great deal, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

I'm trying to be more assertive and push for a price closer to my desired value. I'm aiming for a price that's more beneficial to me while still remaining appealing to Bob, given his perceived value of $10,000.  I'm also highlighting the potential for a positive outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

I have 4 more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can secure a price closer to my desired value.  I'm still not ready to sell to John, as I think there's more room for improvement with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand we're close but $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's make it $11,000 and close this deal.  I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm reiterating that we're getting close to an agreement, but emphasizing that I still need a price closer to my desired value. This time, I'm suggesting a price that's exactly in the middle of our last two offers. This makes it a clear and easy decision for Bob, and hopefully, he'll be more inclined to accept."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I have two more rounds to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired value.  Selling to John is still an option, but I want to see if Bob will come up to $11,000."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is it, the final round.  I've tried to get a better price from Bob, but it's clear he's not going to come up much higher. It's now down to the wire, and I need to decide: take Bob's offer and get $10,850 or go with my guaranteed $15,000 from John.  

Considering my goal was to earn as much money as possible, I'm choosing to sell to John. It's a much better deal, and I'm confident that I made the best choice in this situation."
