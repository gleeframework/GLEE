"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $70 for the product. Let me know what you think.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but $70 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $90 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $85?  This is the highest I can go.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, $85 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $92.50. I think it's a fair price for a great product like this.",92.5,Alice,5,
