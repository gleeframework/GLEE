"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could come to an agreement. I am offering the product to you for $14,000. This price reflects its high value and the opportunity it presents for you. I hope we can work together to make this transaction successful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore these options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit from your initial price, but $14,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  This price is fair considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. I'd like to counter your offer with a suggestion of $13,500 for the product. This price is higher than your offer but lower than my initial asking price. It represents a fair compromise, allowing you to benefit from the product's value while staying within your budget. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. While $13,500 is closer to his desired price, he can potentially get it for even less by continuing to negotiate with Alice. He can also still buy from John for $12,000, which is his absolute limit. Rejecting Alice's offer allows him to explore these options further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This reflects the value of the product to me and allows for some room for both of us to be happy. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13000}
