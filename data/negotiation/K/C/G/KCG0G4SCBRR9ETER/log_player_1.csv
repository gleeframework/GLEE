"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** This offer is still within my minimum acceptable price, allowing for potential concessions. 
* **Positive Message:** The message is friendly and suggests a win-win situation for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.
* **Room for further negotiation:** I can likely get a higher price by continuing the negotiation process. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired $120. 
* **Selling to John is not optimal yet:**  While selling to John guarantees $120, I have the opportunity to potentially earn more by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested in the product.  I can go down to $110, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still remaining above my minimum.
* **""Final Offer"" Strategy:** This creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not immediately accepting his offer, showing that I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to pay $108.  Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, suggesting there's a possibility he'll go higher.
* **Risk of Losing to John:** While John offers a guaranteed $120, I'm only 2 rounds away from reaching my minimum with Bob.  
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and potentially close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $108 just isn't working for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's, showing my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasize Value:**  Reiterating the product's value reminds Bob of the potential benefits, making him more likely to accept.
* **Closing Pressure:**  The message emphasizes closing the deal, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Balancing Risk:**  While I'm still below my desired price, I'm moving closer to my minimum and have a higher chance of closing with Bob."
