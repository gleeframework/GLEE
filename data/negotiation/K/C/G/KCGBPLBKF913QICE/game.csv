"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $10,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I'm not quite ready to pay $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $9,000, which would be $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference again and go with $9,250.  This feels like a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $9,375. This is the lowest I can go and still ensure I make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",9375.0,Alice,5,
