I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to explore if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium for the product.  I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is a good start, but I'm still aiming higher. I'll reject his counteroffer and see if I can push the price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counter-offering at $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer. I'm showing flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit."
