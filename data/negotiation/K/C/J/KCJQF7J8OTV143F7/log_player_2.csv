"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $150 to him, accepting Alice's offer of $160 is not a good deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $140 for the product, which is $10 less than Alice's initial offer and $10 below his own maximum price. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and there's room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still $5 more than what he's willing to pay. Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate and has a few rounds left. He can likely secure a better price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 145} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $145. This shows Alice he's serious about buying the product but is still trying to get a better price. It's also a good compromise point, as it's halfway between his previous offer and Alice's most recent one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $2 more than what Bob is willing to pay, and there are only a few rounds left.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $150. This guarantees him the product at his maximum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation failing."
