Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping to leverage the fact that Bob might be willing to pay a little more than what it's worth to him to get the product.  This leaves room for negotiation if he rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see that this is a fair price, considering he's already offered $9,000, and that this is better than getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $9,500, which is only $500 away from my minimum acceptable price. This is a good deal for me, as I'm already close to my minimum price.  It's also better than selling to John for $10,000, as I would be getting $500 more from Bob."
