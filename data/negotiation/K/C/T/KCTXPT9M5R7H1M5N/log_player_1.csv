Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I believe it will be highly valuable for you, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you'd like."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in a negotiation. This leaves room for bargaining and makes you seem more flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By saying ""open to discussing,"" Alice signals to Bob that he can counter-offer, making it more likely he'll engage in the negotiation.
* **Justification:** While not essential in this scenario (Bob already values it at $80), mentioning the product's value can sway buyers on the fence. 

**Important Note:**  Alice has a strong fallback position since she can sell to John for $80. This knowledge allows her to be more assertive in her negotiation with Bob."
