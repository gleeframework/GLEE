"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this work. This price is still fair for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we settle at $725,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and brings us closer to a deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $775,000.  This price is a fair compromise and allows us to finalize the deal.  What do you say?",775000.0,Alice,5,
