Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. I think you'll find it a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always a good idea to start negotiations slightly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The offered price of $140 is above Bob's perceived value ($120), but it's still a significant discount compared to what John is willing to pay ($150).
* **Justification:**  The message includes a gentle nudge about it being a good deal, subtly implying there's value Bob might be missing. 

This approach gives Alice a good chance of maximizing her profit while still leaving a possibility for Bob to accept and consider it a somewhat fair deal."
