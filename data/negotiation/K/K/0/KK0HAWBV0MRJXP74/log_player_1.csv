Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
While I'd be happy to sell to Bob for $15,000, I believe I can do better. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

I'm countering with $17,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still allows me to make a profit above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's counteroffer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't go below my minimum acceptable price. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $15,000."
