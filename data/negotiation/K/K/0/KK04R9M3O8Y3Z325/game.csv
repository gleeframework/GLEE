"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. I'm really trying to make this work. Would you consider $9,500? That's a firm offer on my end.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still quite a bit below my target price.  I'm willing to go down to $10,500, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer. This reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
