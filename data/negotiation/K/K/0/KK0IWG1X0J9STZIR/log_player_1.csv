Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a special price, considering our long-standing relationship.  I'm sure you'll find it a great deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I'm aiming for a price that's close to my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000), while still being attractive enough to Bob.  $950,000 is a decent compromise.
* **Relationship Building:** The message emphasizes the positive relationship with Bob,  making it more likely he'll consider my offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects, I have John lined up to buy for my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money."
