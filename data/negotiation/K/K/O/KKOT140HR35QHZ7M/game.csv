"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I'd get from another buyer. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $850,000.  This would be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
