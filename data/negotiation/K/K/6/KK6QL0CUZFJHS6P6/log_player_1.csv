Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $900,000 offer. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation with Bob."
