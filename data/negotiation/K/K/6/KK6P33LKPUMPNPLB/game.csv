"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway between $200 and $120? I propose an offer of $160 for the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see where you're coming from, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground. Let's aim for a fair compromise. How does $150 sound for the product? This way, we both get what we need.",150.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",130.0,Bob,8,
