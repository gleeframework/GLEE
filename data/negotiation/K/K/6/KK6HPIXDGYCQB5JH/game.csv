"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering your value for this product is $800,000, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This gives you a nice profit while still being within my budget.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair compromise and allows you a healthy profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $912,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",912500.0,Alice,5,
