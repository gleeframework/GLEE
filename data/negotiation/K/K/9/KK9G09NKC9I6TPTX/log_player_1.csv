Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to secure a good deal. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for the minimum I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'll counter with a new offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $850,000. This is a compromise, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, so I'm going to accept it. It's better to secure a deal now than risk a counteroffer that could be even lower."
