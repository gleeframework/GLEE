``` 

**Explanation:**  You want to save as much money as possible. Buying from John for $800,000 is the best option if you walk away now. However, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  Rejecting her initial offer is the first step in that negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**  Starting with a counteroffer of $750,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $900,000. This shows Alice you are serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if you can't find a price that works for you.  It's a fair starting point, leaving room for potential compromise without being too aggressive."
