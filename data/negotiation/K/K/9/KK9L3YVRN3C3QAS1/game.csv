"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $8,500. I can do $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I can do $9,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
