# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

You can do better than $9,500. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $8,500. I can do $9,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,000 is better than Alice's original offer, you can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting allows you to keep pushing for your desired price point."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I can do $9,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's getting close, but $9,250 is still too high for Bob.  At this point, it's more beneficial to purchase from John for $12,000.  While it's the highest price, it's a quicker solution and avoids further negotiation."
