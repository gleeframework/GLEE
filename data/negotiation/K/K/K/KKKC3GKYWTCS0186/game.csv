"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, though.  How about we settle on $9,000? This price still offers you a great deal while also allowing me to get closer to my desired value.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. Would $8,500 be acceptable for you?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $9,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find it a good deal. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
