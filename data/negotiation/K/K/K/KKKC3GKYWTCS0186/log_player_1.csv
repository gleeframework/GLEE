``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. It also emphasizes the value proposition to encourage Bob to consider the offer.  I'm hoping to get as close to my desired $12,000 as possible, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my desired amount."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. Would $8,500 be acceptable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

While $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try for a slightly higher price in the next round. I'm hoping Bob is willing to budge a bit more."
