Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This gives you a significant discount while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I could offer the product for $1,200,000 (its worth to me) and John would buy it, there's an opportunity to make even more profit by negotiating with Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Perspective:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so any offer above that is potentially appealing to him.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  The $1,100,000 offer creates a substantial profit margin for me ($300,000 over Bob's valuation) while still offering Bob a significant discount ($100,000).

This strategy balances risk and reward:

* **If Bob accepts:** I make a significant profit above my minimum.
* **If Bob rejects:** I can confidently sell to John at my desired price."
