"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This gives you a significant discount while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm interested in buying the product, but I'm not sure if $1,100,000 is a good deal for me. I'd like to save as much money as possible.

Since I'm willing to spend up to $800,000, I'll reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $800,000.
