"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price. How about $1,350,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
