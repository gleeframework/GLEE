"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. To start, I'm offering it for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $1,400,000 is lower than Bob's maximum, it's still above what the product is worth to Alice. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a better price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore better deals. Buying from John is the safe option, but not the most cost-effective."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's true value.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:**  This counteroffer is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer. It demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate and shows that he's aware of the product's worth. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** $1,200,000 is well within the acceptable range for Bob (below his maximum) and leaves room for further negotiations.
* **Negotiation Focus:** The message emphasizes finding a price that benefits both parties, setting a collaborative tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price. How about $1,350,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counter is Higher:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above what Bob is comfortable with. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room to negotiate further. Bob wants to get the price even lower. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  While John's offer isn't ideal, it serves as a backup option if Bob can't get a better deal with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** Bob is willing to increase his offer but only by a small amount, showing his commitment to saving money.
* **Appealing to Mutual Benefit:** The message highlights the benefit for both parties, emphasizing that finding a fair price is important.
* **Staying Below John's Price:** This offer keeps Bob's options open, as it's still lower than John's price."
