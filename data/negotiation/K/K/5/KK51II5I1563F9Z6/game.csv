"I understand you're looking to negotiate further, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $925000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925000 and $825000, which would be $875000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800000.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $875000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875000 and $825000, which would be $850000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000.",850000.0,Bob,6,
