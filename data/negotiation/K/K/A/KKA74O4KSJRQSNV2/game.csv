"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you have.  To kick things off, I'm offering it at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the enthusiasm but $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand where you're coming from, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $7,000? That would work much better for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for sticking with me on this. I'm trying to make this work, but $7,000 is cutting it too close. Perhaps we could settle on $9,500? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more affordable. Would you be willing to do $7,500?  I think that's a reasonable offer.",7500.0,Bob,6,
