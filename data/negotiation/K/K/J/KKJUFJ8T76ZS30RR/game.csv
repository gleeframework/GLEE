"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for a product worth at least $1,000,000 to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just too low for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it still leaves you with a significant profit margin. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $1,025,000 is still outside of my comfort zone. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which gives you a solid profit.  It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $925,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be at least $975,000.  This is still a good profit for you, and it's the closest I can get to meeting you halfway.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet at $950,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  Let's be reasonable and get this done!",950000.0,Bob,6,
