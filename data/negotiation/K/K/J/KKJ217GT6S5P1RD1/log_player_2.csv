"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see how much room there is for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still too high. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle on $120? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to make a deal."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

I'm aiming for my maximum price. This will show Alice I'm serious while still leaving some room for negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm not willing to go as low as $120, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $130. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower, and $130 is close enough to my target price. It's better to accept a slightly higher price than risk losing the deal and having to buy from John for my maximum price anyway."
