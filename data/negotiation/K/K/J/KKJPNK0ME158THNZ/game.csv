"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset that will bring you significant returns. Let's start the negotiation with this price, what do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is still significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,075,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000, which is closer to your offer but still reflects the product's true value. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,090,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get the best deal, and I admire that. However, $1,080,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,085,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations. Let's reach a final agreement.",1085000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,085,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. Can you consider meeting me at $1,080,000?",1080000.0,Bob,8,
