Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $9,500. This offer is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price. With only two rounds left, I need to make a decisive move. I am confident that Alice will accept this offer, as it is closer to her desired price point. If she rejects, I will buy from John in the next round."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,984.38. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,984.38
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the last round of negotiation, and Alice is clearly not willing to go lower than $9,984.38.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation. Buying from John for $10,000 is the best option, as it guarantees I get the product at a fixed price, and the difference between his price and Alice's last offer is negligible."
