"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $120 by myself. Considering its worth to you is $100, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I am proposing to sell the product to you for $110. This way, you save $10 compared to its perceived value, and I receive a profit of $10. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
