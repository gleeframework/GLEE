"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still too high for me. Let's try $9,500.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. ",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit higher than your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to consider, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",11000.0,Alice,5,
