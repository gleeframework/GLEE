"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would that work for you?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $12,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I could consider $18,000. This still represents a good deal for you on a high-quality item.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $18,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? That's a fair price.",15000.0,Bob,4,
