"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to offer $850000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $900000? This would still give you a considerable profit while acknowledging the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $875000? This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to benefit from the transaction.",875000.0,Bob,4,
