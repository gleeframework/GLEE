"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product is extremely valuable and I'm confident it can be a great asset for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This price reflects its true worth while giving you a significant advantage. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $950,000.  Since you know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $900000? This would still give you a considerable profit while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to negotiate.  You're still paying more than the product's worth to her.  There's still potential for a lower price, so rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open."
