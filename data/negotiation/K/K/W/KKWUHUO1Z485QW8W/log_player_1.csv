"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I believe this strategy will maximize my potential earnings while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $7,500 is below my minimum threshold of $8,000.  I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price by counter-offering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, while still securing a profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 meets my minimum threshold. It's a good deal for me, and I'm not willing to risk going through more rounds of negotiation for the chance of getting a slightly higher price.  It's also possible that Bob will continue to lower his offers in future rounds, making this a good opportunity to close the deal."
