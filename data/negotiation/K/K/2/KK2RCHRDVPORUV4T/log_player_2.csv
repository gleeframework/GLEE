Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $118, but that's as low as I can go. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. Is $118 acceptable to you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below her stated minimum of $118.  Since you can get the product for $120 from John, it's no longer worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
