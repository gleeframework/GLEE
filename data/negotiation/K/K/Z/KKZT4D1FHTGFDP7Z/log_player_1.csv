Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable value:** This gives you some flexibility to negotiate downwards if needed. 

By starting with a higher price, you can try to maximize your profit.  If Bob rejects, you can always lower the price in subsequent counteroffers, or sell to John for your minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable value of $12,000. 
* It's also below the $8,000 value he places on the product, indicating he's trying to get a very good deal.
* There's still room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* Selling to John immediately guarantees your minimum value, but you might be able to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to Bob's value:** This shows willingness to negotiate and makes Bob more likely to accept.
* **Counteroffer is still above your minimum acceptable value:** You're still earning more than if you sold to John.

This strategy balances getting a good price with keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would that be possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable value:** While it's closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum. 
* **You have a guaranteed alternative:** You can sell to John for $12,000, making this offer less attractive.
* **There's room for a final counteroffer:**  You can still increase the price a bit and potentially reach a compromise with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a final counteroffer closer to your minimum value. This gives you a better chance of getting a higher price than selling to John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $7,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $7,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final counteroffer:**  This is likely the last offer you'll make before resorting to selling to John.
* **Splitting the difference:** This shows you're willing to compromise and reach a middle ground.
* **Still above your minimum value:** This ensures you're getting at least $7,500, which is better than selling to John. 

By offering $7,500, you're showing a strong commitment to closing the deal while still protecting your interests. This final offer puts pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal entirely."
