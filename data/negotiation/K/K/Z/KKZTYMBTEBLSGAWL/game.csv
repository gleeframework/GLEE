"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can we meet in the middle at $10,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I can't go any lower than $10,500.  This is a high-quality product, and I'm confident it's worth this price.  Think about it, and let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10,000, which is the price I can get from John. Can you consider $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,6,
