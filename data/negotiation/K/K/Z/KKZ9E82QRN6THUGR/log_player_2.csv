"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd really love. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price.  What do you think about $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $120 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $150. There's a chance you could get a better deal from Alice if you reject her initial offer."
