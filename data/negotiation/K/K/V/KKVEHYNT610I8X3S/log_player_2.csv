"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, it's still above what the product is worth to Alice ($1,000,000).  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($1,000,000). There's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially secure a better deal.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows for further exploration of possible prices."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still a bit above where I'm comfortable.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair compromise given the value of the product to both of us.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product for $900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is a slight compromise from my original price. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is a good compromise. It's below my initial target price of $900,000 but still significantly lower than what I would pay John ($1,200,000).  

The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice may become unwilling to sell at all, forcing me to buy from John at a much higher price. It's better to secure this deal and save $280,000 compared to buying from John."
