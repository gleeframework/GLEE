"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Optimism:** By offering a high price initially, I create room for potential concessions and maximize my potential earnings. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive message encourages Bob to consider the offer and opens the door for a friendly negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the first round. I'm prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's reaction and the number of rounds remaining. If negotiations stall or seem unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price, I'll be ready to sell to John at my minimum price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** Bob's counteroffer demonstrates his interest in the product. This presents an opportunity to continue negotiations and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Time Remaining:**  We're only in round 2, and I have ample time to negotiate with Bob.  There's no need to rush into a decision that doesn't benefit me financially.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range, but still acknowledging Bob's need for a lower price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,400,000?  This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Sort Of):** My counteroffer is a significant step down from my initial price but still above my minimum acceptable price point. It shows flexibility while trying to secure a reasonable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize that $1,400,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his perceived value of the product.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation open and friendly.

**Important Note:**

* I'm aware that this might be a bit more aggressive than a typical ""meet in the middle"" approach.  However, with only 10 rounds, I want to be strategic and move the price closer to my target quickly.
*  If Bob rejects this offer, I will re-evaluate the situation, taking into account the remaining rounds and his potential counteroffers, before making my next decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $1,300,000. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to sell at a loss.
* **Negotiation Space:** While Bob is getting closer, there's still room for negotiation.  We have 6 rounds remaining, and I believe we can reach a more agreeable price.
* **Strategic Play:**  By rejecting his offer, I signal my determination to get a better price. This might encourage Bob to offer a higher amount in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price while still acknowledging his limitations.  However, I'll be closely monitoring the situation and the remaining rounds to determine if selling to John becomes the more favorable option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This feels fair for both of us and lets us move forward. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer meets Bob halfway, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  It's a more moderate approach than the previous round.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  By continuing the negotiation, we can keep the dialogue open and potentially reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $1,350,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't make a loss.

**Important Note:**

* I'm closely monitoring the situation and considering the remaining rounds. If Bob continues to reject offers close to my minimum, I might start considering selling to John.
* I'll be adjusting my strategy in subsequent rounds based on Bob's responses, aiming to achieve the best possible outcome while remaining within my acceptable price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the negotiation is becoming increasingly time-sensitive. 
* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to risk losing a substantial amount of money.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get a higher price, I need to be pragmatic and secure a deal that meets my financial goals.

**Conclusion:**

Based on Bob's continued unwillingness to reach a price close to my minimum, and considering the limited time remaining, I've decided to sell the product to John. This ensures I receive my desired value and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower price."
