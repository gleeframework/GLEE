"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and the market rate. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
