"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and the market rate. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob has made it clear he won't go above $1,200,000. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for that same amount, there's no point in further negotiation with Bob. It's time to move on and secure the sale with John."
