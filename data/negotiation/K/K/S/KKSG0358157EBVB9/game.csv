"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference on our last two offers and call it $812,500? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",812500.0,Alice,5,
