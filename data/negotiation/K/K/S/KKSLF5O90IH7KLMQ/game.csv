"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. Let's see if we can make this work!",11500.0,Alice,3,
