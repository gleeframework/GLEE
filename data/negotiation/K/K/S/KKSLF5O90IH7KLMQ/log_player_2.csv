You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  Now you can try to negotiate a better price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

You should buy from John. Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget, and you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice when a better deal is already available."
