Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This allows room for negotiation without immediately alienating Bob.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value Bob will receive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to respond and potentially start a negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to find a middle ground where Bob feels like he's getting a good deal, while I still earn a reasonable profit. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer, potentially dropping the price a bit, but always staying above my minimum acceptable price.  I also have the option to switch to John at any point if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my $15,000 minimum.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is willing to negotiate, and his offer shows he's interested. I can likely get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John guarantees $15,000,  I can potentially earn more by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Next Step:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while maintaining a strong position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept the deal.
* **Remaining Above Minimum:** $11,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I'm not losing money.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept. However, I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if needed. If Bob rejects, I'll consider lowering my price further, but I'll try to stay above $11,000."
