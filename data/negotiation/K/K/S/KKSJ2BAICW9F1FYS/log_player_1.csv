Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your fallback position.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $500,000 surplus you could capture.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to negotiate higher.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal.  Going too close to $1,500,000 might scare him off.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of desirability.
* **Confidence and Value:** Phrases like ""unique value"" and ""significantly benefit you"" reinforce the product's worth.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 is a strong opening. It gives you room to negotiate down slightly if Bob hesitates while still securing a substantial profit above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance, you might adjust the offer slightly."
