"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a fair price, and I get a quick sale. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is better than her initial asking price, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  There's no reason to pay more than you have to."
