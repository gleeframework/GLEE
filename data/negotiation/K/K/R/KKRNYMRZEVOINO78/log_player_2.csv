Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price.  You could make a counteroffer slightly higher than your current offer to show good faith, but ultimately, you're aiming for a price closer to your maximum budget."
