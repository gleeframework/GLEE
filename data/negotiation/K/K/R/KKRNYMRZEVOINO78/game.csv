"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll agree that it's a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate you offering the product, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet halfway: I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This represents a significant savings for you compared to your initial offer and would be a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,080,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're still not satisfied, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
