"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which reflects the product's value while acknowledging your financial constraints. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still slightly above my maximum budget. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to reach a deal. Let's work together to finalize this transaction.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
