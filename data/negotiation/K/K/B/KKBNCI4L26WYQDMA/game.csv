"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still leaving room for you to profit. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to go to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'm prepared to move on.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
