Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$17,000:**  This price is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum value ($15,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to build rapport with Bob, emphasize the value to him, and open the door for a potential counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to get the best possible price while keeping the negotiation open.  I'm willing to go down from my initial offer if necessary, but I won't settle for less than $15,000.  John's offer acts as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about $16000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? That would allow us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $16,500 is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer but still allows me to make a profit above my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone and demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, how about we aim for $16000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come back to his initial counteroffer of $16,000. While it's not the ideal price, it's still a profitable deal for me, exceeding my minimum value of $15,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, and John's offer provides a safety net.  It's time to close the deal."
