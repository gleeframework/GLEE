Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $12,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I can't go lower than $12,000. This product is worth a lot to me, and I'm confident it will be worth the same to you. How about we split the difference at $12,750?"", ""product_price"": 12750}

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a bit more, $12,200 is above my minimum price and getting closer to what I feel the product is worth.  It's also a better deal than selling to John."
