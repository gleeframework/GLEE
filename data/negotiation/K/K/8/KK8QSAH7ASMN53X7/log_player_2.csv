Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your target price. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair value for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to settle on $1,025,000 just yet. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a small increase, but it's still a compromise that reflects the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $1,075,000. Accepting now secures a reasonable price without risking the deal falling through."
