Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This product is truly worth it, and I believe this revised price reflects its value."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $11,250? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher on the price I'm willing to pay. How about we meet at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob seems pretty set on a price around $9,000. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll get much higher than that in the remaining rounds. Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees us a profit and avoids the risk of Bob's negotiations stalling completely."
