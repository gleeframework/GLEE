Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate its value, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain limit. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is already at his maximum valuation of the product. There's no room for negotiation to get a higher price.  It's best to take the guaranteed $100 from John."
