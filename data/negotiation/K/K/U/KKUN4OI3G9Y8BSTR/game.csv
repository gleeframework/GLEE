"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $900,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This shows my genuine interest in your product and allows for a reasonable margin for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. $875,000 is getting closer to my target, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close as possible to the value I have in mind. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $920,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable solution.  Let's try $890,000. This is a good compromise and keeps things moving in the right direction.",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. $890,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not getting as much as I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close as possible to the value I have in mind. I'm counteroffering at $915,000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility, but $915,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. It's a win-win for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get as close as possible to the value I have in mind. I'm counteroffering at $910,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal at this price.",910000.0,Alice,9,
