Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. $875,000 is getting closer to my target, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close as possible to the value I have in mind. I'm counteroffering at $920,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $920,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range.

Alice's offer of $915,000 is getting closer to my target, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm determined to get the price down further and feel there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can secure a more favorable price by continuing the negotiation process. It's worth exploring a few more rounds before I consider buying from John."
