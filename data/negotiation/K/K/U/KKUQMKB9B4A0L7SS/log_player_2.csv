"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both my valuation and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's important to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** By starting low, I give myself space to increase my offer gradually while still aiming for a price well below $10,000.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:**  This offer will help me understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $12,000?  That would make it worth letting go of for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved a bit, but $12,000 is still a way off from my target price and even worse than John's deal.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's my absolute top price."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching My Limit:** I'm willing to pay John $10,000, so offering Alice the same price is reasonable. 
* **Signaling a Firm Stance:** By stating this is my top price, I'm indicating I'm unlikely to go higher. 
* **Putting the Ball in Alice's Court:** Now it's up to Alice to decide if she's willing to accept a price that meets my needs."
