"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $12,000?  That would make it worth letting go of for me.",12000.0,Alice,3,
