Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,900. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you."",
""product_price"": 11900
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible without going below her own $12,000 minimum. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,900 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring Alice makes a significant profit if he accepts.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, guaranteeing she won't have to sell below her minimum. This allows her to confidently aim high with Bob."
