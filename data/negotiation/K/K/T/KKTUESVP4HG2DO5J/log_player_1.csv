Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $19,000."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting high ($19,000) allows room for negotiation.  It also positions the product as highly valuable.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The fact that you have John as a backup gives you leverage in the negotiation. Bob doesn't know about John, but the confidence from having a backup might be apparent. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower.
* **Bob's Perspective:** Keep in mind that Bob will only buy if the price is right for him. There's a chance he'll reject the offer."
