"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $950,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $987,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",987500.0,Bob,4,
