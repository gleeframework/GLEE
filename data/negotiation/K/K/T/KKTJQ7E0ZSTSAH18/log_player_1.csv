Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best price I can offer right now. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This allows for negotiation room.
* **Framing it positively:** I emphasize the deal being good for Bob, rather than focusing on my need for a high price.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not giving away the farm. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing further. If it's too low, I'll make a counteroffer or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **John is a better option:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so there's no reason to settle for less.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While I could counteroffer Bob, it's unlikely we'll reach an agreement quickly. Time is valuable, and I have a guaranteed sale with John.

**Next Steps:**

I will immediately move to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $950,000? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but stating it's unacceptable. I'm providing a counter-offer that's closer to my minimum price, hoping to find a middle ground. 
* **Maintain a firm stance:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to drop my price too far. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the potential for a ""great price"" for Bob, reminding him of the product's value.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I've successfully negotiated a decent price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll have to decide if I want to counter-offer again or accept John's offer of $1,200,000. The decision will depend on how much time I'm willing to spend negotiating and how confident I am of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That seems fair to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, even though Bob is getting closer.
* **John is the safer bet:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at a price that meets my minimum requirements. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will budge further, and continued negotiation could take up more time, potentially leading to a lower price or a failed deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will immediately move to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's the most secure option to ensure I reach my desired financial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too far below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $975,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this final offer."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm signaling that this is my last counter-offer, hoping to create urgency and pressure Bob to accept.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price, indicating my willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price for both parties, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and avoid further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a decent price while avoiding a deal with John.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll stick to my decision and sell to John for $1,200,000.  Further negotiation with Bob at this point is unlikely to lead to a better outcome."
