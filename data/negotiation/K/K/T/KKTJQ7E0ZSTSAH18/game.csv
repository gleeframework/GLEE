"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $950,000? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That seems fair to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too far below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $975,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this final offer.",975000.0,Alice,5,
