"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best price I can offer right now. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Aiming for Savings:** My goal is to save as much as possible, and this offer reflects that.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm expecting Alice to counter, and this offer gives us space to find a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $950,000? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Negotiating:** Her willingness to come down in price suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **Still Below John:** Even though Alice's offer is closer to John's, it's still worthwhile to see if I can get a better deal from Alice before going with John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That seems fair to me."", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By suggesting $900,000, I'm splitting the difference between her current offer ($950,000) and my previous offer ($850,000). This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal fairness.
* **Staying Competitive:** This price keeps me below John's offer while still being a potentially attractive price for Alice. 
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help me gauge how much further down Alice is willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too far below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $975,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Firming Up:** Her language (""final offer"") and smaller price reduction suggest she's unlikely to move much further.
* **John's Deal is Better:** At this point, Alice's best offer ($975,000) is only slightly better than John's ($1,000,000).  
* **Time and Risk:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her not budging and the potential loss of John's offer.  It's not worth the small potential savings."
