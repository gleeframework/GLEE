"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $140. I believe this price reflects the value it holds for you, given its worth to you is $150. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can do better than $140. He values the product at $150, and Alice values it at $120. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my value for the product. I'm happy to pay $130 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet my expectations. However, I would like to respectfully suggest an offer of $135 for the product. This price not only respects the value you see in the item but also allows for a reasonable profit margin for us. I hope this proposal aligns better with your budget while still ensuring we achieve a satisfactory transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob values the product at $150 and Alice's offer of $135 is within his budget.  While he could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and forcing him to buy from John at $150 outweighs the potential savings. Accepting the offer at $135 ensures Bob gets the product for a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
