Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Bob's offer:

This reflects a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.

While Bob is increasing his offer, his final offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. It's unlikely Bob will bridge that gap. Accepting John's offer ensures I get the best possible price."
