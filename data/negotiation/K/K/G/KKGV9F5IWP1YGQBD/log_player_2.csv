Bob's goal is to save money, and Alice's initial offer is his maximum. There's no reason to accept it immediately.  By rejecting, Bob can potentially get a lower price from Alice or buy from John if negotiations don't go well."

Round 2

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

Accepting this offer secures the product while still achieving a decent discount. There's no reason to risk further negotiation, especially with the threat of buying from John at the original price looming."
