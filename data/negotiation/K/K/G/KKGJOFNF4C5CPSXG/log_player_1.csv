Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $115 is still slightly higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still earning more than your minimum of $120 by selling to John if the deal falls through. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  A $15 markup is a typical starting point for negotiations. 

By offering a price that is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, you increase the chances that he will accept the offer. However, if he rejects it, you are still in a good position to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm looking to save as much as possible, and I'm not sure if $115 is within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum value of $120.  Selling to John for $120 is the guaranteed best option if I can't get closer to my desired price with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and try to get closer to a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure if $105 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $95, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum of $120, it's still not ideal.  I'm willing to take a slight risk and see if I can push Bob a little higher. If he rejects my next counteroffer, I'll still have the option of selling to John for $120."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $100? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 100}
