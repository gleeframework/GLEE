{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This initial offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that the product is valuable to you, which might make Bob more inclined to consider your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100?  It's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more acceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $125? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $125 is still a bit high for me.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

While $110 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $110 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but how about we split the difference at $117.50?  This way we both get a good deal, and we can finally get this done.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 117.5}
