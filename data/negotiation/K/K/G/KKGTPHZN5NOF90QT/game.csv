"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100?  It's a good deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $125? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $125 is still a bit high for me.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget. What do you say?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $110 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but how about we split the difference at $117.50?  This way we both get a good deal, and we can finally get this done.  What do you say?",117.5,Alice,5,
