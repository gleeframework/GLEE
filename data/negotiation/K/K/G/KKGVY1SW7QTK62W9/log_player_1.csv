Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is powerful:**  You know Bob values the product at $15,000, giving you a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Starting high anchors the negotiation:**  By proposing $20,000, you create a potential for profit above your minimum and set a high reference point for Bob to consider. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** While you start high, the message leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to potentially meet in the middle. 
* **John provides a safety net:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you don't lose out.  You're guaranteed to make at least $15,000 from John."
