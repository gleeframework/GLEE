Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,150,000 is higher than your minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate upwards. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:** By starting high, you set a strong starting point and allow for potential counteroffers without immediately dropping your price too low.

Remember,  you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and what you believe the product is worth.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a higher price, potentially reaching a middle ground that benefits both parties. Selling to John right now would mean leaving a substantial amount of money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about $1,100,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both a chance to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  It's $50,000 higher than Bob's offer, showing that you're willing to negotiate but not give in completely. 
* **Lower than your initial offer:** This signals flexibility and a desire to find common ground. 
* **Still profitable for you:** It's significantly above your minimum acceptable price, ensuring a decent profit.

The message is friendly and emphasizes the benefits of the deal for both parties, encouraging Bob to consider your offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  Could you do $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still a significant amount lower than what you think the product is worth.  It's worth taking one more round of negotiation to see if you can bridge the gap further.  Selling to John right now would mean losing out on a potentially more profitable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  Would you consider $1,087,500?  It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1087500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is exactly in the middle between your previous counteroffer ($1,100,000) and Bob's latest offer ($1,075,000). This shows you're willing to meet him halfway.
* **Still profitable:**  The price is still above your minimum, ensuring you make a decent profit.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes a ""win-win"" scenario, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting. 

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still safeguarding your profits. It's a strategic move aimed at closing the deal."
