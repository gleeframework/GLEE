"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range. It leaves room for potential counteroffers while also setting a firm starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is a better deal than Bob's initial valuation, it still falls short of my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'm asking for $110. This is a fair price that accounts for the value of the product and my own costs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $107. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $107 is still too low. I'll continue negotiating, hoping to secure a better deal.  I want to see if I can push him to $110 or at least get a counteroffer that's closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this, but $107 is still below my target price. Let's try to meet in the middle. How about $109? I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm glad we're able to continue our discussion. I would like to propose a price of $108. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $108 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there. I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get Bob to agree to $110 or higher. There are still a few rounds left, so I have room to try and push the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for both of us. However, $108 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one last compromise, but I need to see $110. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to look at other options. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $109. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $109, which is only $1 away from my target price of $110.  With only two rounds left, the risk of losing the sale to Bob and having to sell to John at $120 is too high.  I'm better off accepting this offer and securing a sale, even if it's slightly lower than my ideal outcome."
