Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** By not going for the full $1,000,000, I show a willingness to negotiate, which might make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, reminding him of its potential benefits. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer. If it's too low, I'll be prepared to make a counter-counteroffer, potentially moving closer to my target price of $1,000,000. However, if negotiations stall, I'm ready to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to this amount? I'm eager to make a purchase, and I believe we could reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, selling at $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product and leaves me with a substantial loss.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer, trying to find a compromise that allows me to earn a better price.  I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer of $900,000, while still being open to further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a specific price point. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $850,000, recognizing the value you see in my product.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising, but not conceding:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping my price to $850,000, but I'm still above his offer of $800,000. This shows flexibility without drastically lowering my profit margin.
* **Highlighting the value again:**  I reiterate the value of the product to reinforce its worth and justify the price.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I frame the offer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of equity. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob.  If he rejects it, I'll have to assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make another counteroffer, or move on to John."
