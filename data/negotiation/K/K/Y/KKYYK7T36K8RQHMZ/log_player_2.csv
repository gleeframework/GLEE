"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least $10,000 to me and significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still higher than the product's value to Bob. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a better price with John or find another seller."
