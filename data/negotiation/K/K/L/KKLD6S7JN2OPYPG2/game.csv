"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $78, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $82. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my minimum.  What do you think?",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $78 and $82, which would be $80. Can you accept that price?",80.0,Bob,6,
