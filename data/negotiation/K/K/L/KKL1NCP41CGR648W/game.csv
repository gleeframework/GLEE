"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $14,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $14,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $16,000? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle.  How about $15,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction.",15500.0,Bob,4,
