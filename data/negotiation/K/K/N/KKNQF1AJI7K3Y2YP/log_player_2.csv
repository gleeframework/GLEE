"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can likely get a better deal than $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,500. I understand that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

You can still do better than $11,000. You've already shown Alice you're willing to negotiate, and you know the product's value to her is only $8,000. Keep the pressure on!"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice is now offering $10,500, which is a good deal for you.  You can likely get a better price if you keep negotiating, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away and you'll have to buy from John for $15,000.  It's worth taking the offer to save $4,500."
