"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested but $140 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to do $125?  I'm ready to buy it at that price.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I can go down to $135, but that's my final offer.  This product is really worth more, so let's see if we can find common ground.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $130?  I'm very interested in this product and I think this price is fair for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
