"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $100 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $90?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $90, which would be $95. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,5,
