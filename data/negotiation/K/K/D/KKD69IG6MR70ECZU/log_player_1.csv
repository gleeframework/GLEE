Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's room to make even more profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it slightly above his valuation creates a potential win-win.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties adds a time constraint and might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer doesn't have to be the final price. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still likely settle above your minimum."
