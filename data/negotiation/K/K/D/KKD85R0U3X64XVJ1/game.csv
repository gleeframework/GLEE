"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $100 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $110. If you're willing to meet me halfway, we can finalize the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but $110 is still too low. I'm prepared to lower my price to $120.  This is a final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
