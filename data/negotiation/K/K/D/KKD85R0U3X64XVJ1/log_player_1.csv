"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a better price.  Selling to John guarantees me $150, but I want to see if I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $100 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $110. If you're willing to meet me halfway, we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to risk another round to see if Bob will come up to $125, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but $110 is still too low. I'm prepared to lower my price to $120.  This is a final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
