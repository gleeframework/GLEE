Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price:** This makes it attractive to Bob while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This incentivizes him to consider my offer seriously.
* **It allows for potential counteroffers:** If Bob rejects, I can still negotiate further.

I will continue to analyze Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly, always keeping in mind the $1,000,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, I still believe I can get a better price. 

* I know the product is worth more to Bob than $850,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer that signals my commitment to a higher price.
* Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, but I want to maximize my profit, so I'll explore further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial proposal.  How about $875,000?  This would give you a great deal on the product, and it's still a good deal for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm not giving in completely.
* **Maintain Value:** $875,000 is still above Bob's perceived value, which gives him incentive to consider my counteroffer.
* **Reasoned Justification:**  I'm framing the price in terms of benefit for both of us, which makes it less likely to be seen as an arbitrary demand.

By offering $875,000, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to reassess the situation and consider if selling to John is the best option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $850,000 is a significant distance from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While further negotiation is possible, it's becoming clear that getting a price closer to my target is unlikely.  

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of further price concessions and the possibility of a stalemate. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit of $1,000,000, which is a comfortable amount considering my minimum acceptable price.

Therefore, I've decided to accept John's offer and sell the product to him. This decision minimizes risk and guarantees a satisfactory outcome."
