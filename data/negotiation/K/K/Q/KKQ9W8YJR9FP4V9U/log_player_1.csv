"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  I'm open to discussing further, so feel free to share your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth $6,000 to me. So, I could consider buying it for $7,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is quite low, and we have plenty of rounds to negotiate.  Let's see if we can bring him up.

**{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $7,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  Could you consider something closer to $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $12,000 is still too far from what I'm willing to pay.  Could you meet me halfway at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tempting offer from Bob, as it's a good amount above his initial offer. However, we're aiming to get as close to our minimum as possible. Let's try negotiating a bit more.

**{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to the product's value.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, we're getting closer!  $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,500?  That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is clearly willing to move towards a price that works for both of us. $9,500 is a solid offer, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether.
