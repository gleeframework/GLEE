Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This should encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a price we're both happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a more agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $110?  That's still a great deal for you and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $107.5 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to sell for $108.75. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 108.75} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to split the difference, but $108.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $106.25. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting tedious and we're still below my minimum price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
