Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can't pay $9,500 for the product. Could we perhaps negotiate down to $8,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'm not going to sell to John yet because I still have a chance to get a better price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit more, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $9,000? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,500 is closer to my desired price, I still think I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating. I'm not going to sell to John yet because I still have a few rounds to go."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $8,750? This is a fair price considering the value of this product, and it would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $8,600 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. I also don't want to sell to John yet, as I'm still hopeful I can get a slightly better price from Bob."
