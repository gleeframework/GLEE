"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a valuable asset for you.  I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a price above your minimum.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level and give you an idea of his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're willing to negotiate but not at such a low price. 

**Next Steps:** You should make a counteroffer closer to your desired range but still leaving some flexibility for further bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  Could you do $17,000?"",
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly Higher Counter:** By countering at $17,000, you are moving closer to your minimum but still leaving yourself room to negotiate. This demonstrates that you're serious about selling but not desperate.
* **Encouraging a Counter:** The high counteroffer encourages Bob to provide a counteroffer closer to your desired range, potentially revealing more about his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is a slight improvement but remains substantially below your $15,000 minimum. 
* **Negotiating Position:** You still have negotiating room and time (6 rounds left). Continuing to reject low offers maintains a firm negotiating position.

**Next Steps:** It's time to make a smaller counter-offer, signaling that you're willing to move closer to his range, but you still expect him to meet you closer to your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing some common ground here. To move things along, I'd be willing to come down to $15,500. This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality."",
""product_price"": 15500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're making a more substantial concession by coming down $1,500, showing Bob you're flexible and want to make a deal.
* **Close to Minimum:**  The $15,500 offer is just slightly above your minimum, leaving a small buffer for further negotiation while maximizing your potential profit.
* **Highlighting Value:**  You're subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price and prevent him from anchoring too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $12,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer & Below Minimum:** Bob has declared his $12,000 offer as his ""final offer.""  This signals he's unlikely to move significantly higher. Since this is still below your $15,000 minimum, further negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000.  Accepting this guarantees you meet your minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob not budging.
* **Time Considerations:**  While you have rounds left, continuing with Bob might not yield a better outcome and could waste valuable time. 

**It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale with John.**"
