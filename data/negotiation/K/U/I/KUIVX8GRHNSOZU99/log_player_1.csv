Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting,  I'm hoping to get closer to my target price.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him for $80."
