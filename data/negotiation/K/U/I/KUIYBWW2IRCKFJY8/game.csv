"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,400,000 is tempting, it's unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, reflecting the value you've expressed.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet halfway. How about $1,550,000? This price reflects the product's value to you and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
