,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $120.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $165. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $165 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $142.50? I'm really hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us.",142.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, $142.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $155 to make it worth my while. Can we meet at $155?",155.0,Alice,5,
