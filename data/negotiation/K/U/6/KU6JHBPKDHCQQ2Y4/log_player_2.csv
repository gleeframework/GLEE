"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can definitely do better than $950,000. He knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $920000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $920,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still do better. He's aiming to get the product for as close to $800,000 as possible.  Rejecting this offer allows him to counter again and try to push the price down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $900000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. It's a fair price that I think you'll be happy with, and it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been successfully pushing the price down.  While $900,000 is still a significant amount, it's a better deal than what John is offering ($1,000,000).  It's also likely that Alice will not go lower, as she's already made a significant compromise.  Accepting the offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
