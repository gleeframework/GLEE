"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate it, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $87.50.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $87.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $86?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",86.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $86. I'm willing to take another small step back and offer you the product for $88.25. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",88.25,Alice,5,
