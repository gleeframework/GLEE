"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you and the market.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for countering.  $14,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 might still be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,200. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value it holds for you and the market.",13200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and call it $12,100?",12100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $12,100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,200 and $12,100, which would be $12,650. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",12650.0,Alice,7,
