"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but still leaving some room for profit.  I'm hoping this is enough to convince him to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum price, it's still a profit, and I'm running out of rounds. There's a risk of losing the deal entirely if I keep rejecting offers.  It's better to secure a sale now."
