"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for it. Can you meet me at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which still leaves me a bit of room for profit.  I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $95, so I'm offering $87.50. Can you consider that?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $87.50 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $90, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment at that price.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $85. That's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",85.0,Bob,6,
