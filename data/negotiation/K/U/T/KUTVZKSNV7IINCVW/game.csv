"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny!",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is $100. Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $140. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $120. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $130, but I need to make a profit, so I'm not going any lower than that. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $130 is still a stretch for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? That way we both come out ahead.",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $128, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal!",128.0,Alice,7,
