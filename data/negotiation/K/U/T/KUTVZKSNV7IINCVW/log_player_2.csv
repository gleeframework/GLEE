```"

Round 3

Round 4

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $130 is still a stretch for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? That way we both come out ahead."", ""product_price"": 125}

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to my budget, but I'm only willing to go up to $125. Since there are only a few rounds left, it's more advantageous to purchase from John at $100. This ensures I save money and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
