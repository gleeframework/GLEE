Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $1,650,000?"", ""product_price"": 1650000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

Bob is unlikely to go much higher and I have a guaranteed offer for $1,500,000 from John. It's time to take the sure thing."
