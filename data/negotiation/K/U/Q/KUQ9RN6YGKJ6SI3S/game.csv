"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
