# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it would greatly benefit your business.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's benefits. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. After evaluating the situation, I propose a price of $9000 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair transaction while considering your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's new offer is lower than the initial one, it's still above Bob's target.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to pay $8,750. This would allow us to both achieve a successful transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I've reviewed our previous discussions and decided to adjust my proposal slightly. I am now offering the product at $8900. This price reflects the value of the product while also considering your budget. I hope this meets your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is very close to Bob's desired price range, and only slightly above his initial counteroffer of $8,750. It's a good deal for Bob, considering his alternative is to buy from John for $12,000.  At this point, further negotiation might be unlikely to yield a significantly lower price, and it risks losing the deal altogether."
