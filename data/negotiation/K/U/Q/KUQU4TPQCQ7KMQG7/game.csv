"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, as that feels like a fair price based on its value.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a significant way off from what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway and bring the price down to $1,225,000.  This is my final offer.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
