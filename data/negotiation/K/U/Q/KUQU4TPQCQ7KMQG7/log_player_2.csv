"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still too high.  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering. It's also worth exploring how much lower you can go before you'd be better off buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, as that feels like a fair price based on its value.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a significant way off from what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway and bring the price down to $1,225,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still higher than what you'd like to pay, but it's significantly lower than her initial offer and much lower than buying from John.  It's a good deal for you considering your goal is to buy the product while saving money."
