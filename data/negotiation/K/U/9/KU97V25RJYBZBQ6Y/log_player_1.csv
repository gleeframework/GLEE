Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, setting the price extremely high (e.g., $300) is likely to make Bob immediately reject the offer. A price of $180 is a significant markup but still within a reasonable range considering the product's value to Bob. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
