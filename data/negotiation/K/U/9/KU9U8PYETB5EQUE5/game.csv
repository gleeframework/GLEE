"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Let me know if you're interested.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $16,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $15,500. This is as close to my minimum as I'm willing to go. Let me know if you're interested.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting really close.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,750?",14750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $15,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,750 and $15,000. I can offer it to you for $14,875. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",14875.0,Alice,7,
