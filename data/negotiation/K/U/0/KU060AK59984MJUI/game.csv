"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy.  I'm asking for $110 for it.  Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I'm happy to negotiate,  $90 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress!  I understand your position, but $95 just isn't quite there yet.  Let's aim for a middle ground.  How about $98? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $92 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",92.0,Bob,6,
