"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is high-quality, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,5,
