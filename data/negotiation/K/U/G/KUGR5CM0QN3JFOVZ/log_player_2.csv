"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, so he should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is still a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the best I can do, considering the value I've attached to it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is better than Alice's original offer, Bob is still better off continuing to negotiate or buying from John.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so he should continue to try to negotiate a lower price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. This is the minimum price I'm comfortable with, considering the value I've attached to the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you a compromise at $10,750. This is the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

Alice's final offer of $10,750 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  It's time to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John for $8,000."
