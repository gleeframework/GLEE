Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, at least $10,000, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, I can still get more by continuing the negotiation.  I'm willing to take a lower price than my initial offer, but not that low.  I'll see if I can find a middle ground with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm still willing to work with you, and I'm happy to come down a bit further. How about $11,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value."", ""product_price"": 11000}
