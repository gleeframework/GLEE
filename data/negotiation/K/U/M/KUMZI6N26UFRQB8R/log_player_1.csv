I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price. 

I believe this strategy will give me the best chance to maximize my profit. I can always lower the price if Bob rejects the offer, but it's better to start high and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
