Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the product's value significantly exceeds that price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground. While his current offer is tempting, there's still room for negotiation. I'll hold firm for now, but I need to be mindful of not pushing him away completely."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value here. Let's bridge the gap - how about $1,080,000?  This is me demonstrating significant movement to get this deal done."",

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. To show I'm serious, I can go up to $1,070,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close this soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer of $1,070,000 is a reasonable compromise. While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk he might walk away. This offer ensures a significant profit above my minimum, and a sure thing is often better than risking a worse outcome by pushing further."
