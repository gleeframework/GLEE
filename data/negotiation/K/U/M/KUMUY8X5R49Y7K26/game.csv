"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This represents a significant value proposition for you, as you've indicated it's worth $1,200,000 to your company.  While I'm confident in selling it for my desired price, I'd prefer to prioritize a mutually beneficial partnership if possible.  Let me know if you're interested.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
