"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to pay closer to its true value.  How about $1,000,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay closer to the product's true value. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $950,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
