Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I believe a price of $1,800,000 reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), I can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  A high initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's eagerness and potentially secure a much higher profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high price leaves room for negotiation. If Bob counters, I can gradually lower the price, ensuring I still get a great deal.  

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of my guaranteed sale to John. If he knows my fallback option, this approach becomes much riskier."
