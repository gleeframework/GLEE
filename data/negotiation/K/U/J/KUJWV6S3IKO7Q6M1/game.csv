"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $900000?  This is a significant discount, but I'm sure it's still a fair price considering the product's unique qualities.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1100000? I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional item.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1100000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still aiming for a lower price.  How about we settle on $1000000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit while staying within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and $1100000. How about we discuss a price of $1050000? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
