"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $100?  I'm really hoping to get this product, and I'm confident this is a fair price for us both.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130. I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less though.  How about $115?  I'm really close to my limit, but I think this is still a fair price for a product like this.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're close to your limit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $125? I think that's the lowest I can go and still make a fair profit.",125.0,Alice,5,
