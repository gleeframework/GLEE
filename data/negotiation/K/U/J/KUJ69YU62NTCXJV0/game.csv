"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $900,000. This offer reflects the product's potential and is a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
