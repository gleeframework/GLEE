"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($150) to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, so I'm going to reject it. I'm still confident that I can get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? This is still a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not happy with that price. I think I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation. I'm going to reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $130 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm willing to make this final concession to get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are approaching the end of the negotiation rounds and we are still very far from my desired price. Although Bob is showing interest and willingness to negotiate, it doesn't seem like we're going to reach a mutually agreeable price anytime soon.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $150 from John and avoid risking further negotiation with Bob."
