{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're willing to pay up to $80, and Alice's offer is $100.  It makes sense to reject the offer and see if you can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}

I'm offering $70, which is still below my maximum price of $80.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and hopefully, it will entice her to start negotiating seriously."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum price of $80.  It's worth seeing if I can get a lower price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $75. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product."
