"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $100}

I'm starting with a moderate offer, hoping to find a sweet spot between my minimum price of $120 and Bob's maximum willingness to pay of $80. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not willing to sell the product for $70, as it's below my minimum price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $90}

I'm increasing my offer by $20 from the initial offer, trying to get closer to my minimum price of $120. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum price of $120, so I'll reject it again. I'll try to get a better price by sending another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $95}

I'm increasing my offer by $5 from the previous one, trying to get closer to my minimum price of $120. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me at a higher price!"
