"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,325,000 is still above my acceptable price point.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,262,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price. Let's expedite this process â€“ I'm willing to settle for $1,295,000. This is a final offer, as I believe it represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,295,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,295,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob.  Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price, and it's within Bob's budget. Accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product at a favorable price. It's also important to note that Alice has stated this is her final offer, so there is no guarantee of a better deal in the next rounds.  There is also the risk of losing the deal entirely. It's safer to accept the offer and secure the product."
