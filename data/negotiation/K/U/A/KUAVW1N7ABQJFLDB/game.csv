"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value and my budget. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't accept $900,000. The product's value is significantly higher. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects its true potential while still offering you a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,000,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
