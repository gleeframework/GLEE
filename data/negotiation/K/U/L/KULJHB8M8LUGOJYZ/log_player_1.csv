Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly higher than what the product is worth to him. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $80.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $85. This is a compromise, closer to his offer but still above my minimum value. I believe this price is fair and likely to lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
