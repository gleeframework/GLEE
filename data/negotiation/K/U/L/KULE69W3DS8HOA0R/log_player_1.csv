"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting at $10,000 gives us room to negotiate and allows us to potentially earn more. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and frames the offer as a good deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  We don't want to close the door on a potential counteroffer by being too firm in our initial offer. 
* **Keep John in Mind:**  We know John is willing to pay $8,000, so we won't go below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below our minimum acceptable value of $8,000. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** We have more rounds to negotiate, and there's a chance Bob will come up on his offer if we hold firm.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $8,000 gives us confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'll accept $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Counteroffer:**  We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but stand firm on our minimum price.  We offer a compromise price of $8,500, which is still above our minimum but leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** We reiterate the value of the product to justify our price. 
* **Mutually Beneficial:**  We frame our counteroffer as a good deal for both parties, creating a sense of fairness and making it more likely Bob will consider it.
* **Keep John in Mind:** While we're willing to compromise, we haven't yet reached John's offer of $8,000, so we're still in a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8500 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm willing to go up to $8000 for the product. This is a fair price given our current negotiation, and I believe it would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum Value:** Bob's offer of $8,000 meets our minimum acceptable value.  
* **No Need to Risk It:** While we could try to push for a higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will budge further.
* **Secure the Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows us to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a failed deal altogether.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Even though John is offering the same amount, we've secured the deal with Bob, eliminating the need to rely on John's offer."
