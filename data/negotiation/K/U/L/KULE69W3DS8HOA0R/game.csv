"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $7500 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'll accept $8500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8500 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm willing to go up to $8000 for the product. This is a fair price given our current negotiation, and I believe it would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,4,
