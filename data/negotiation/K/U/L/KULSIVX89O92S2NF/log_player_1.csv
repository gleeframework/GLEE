Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, I need to be upfront â€“ I have other potential buyers lined up, and  $1,200,000 is cutting it a bit too close to their offers. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This price reflects the true value of this product and ensures a win-win for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better. My new counteroffer is $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.

We are getting closer to Bob's perceived value, but we are still above John's offer.  There is room to negotiate further and try to secure a better deal than John's offer."
