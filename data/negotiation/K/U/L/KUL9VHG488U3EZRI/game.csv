,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay, but I'm interested in the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a substantial discount from my original offer. It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested in this compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours, at $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise from my side, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
