"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $12,000, accepting Alice's offer at $12,000 won't save him any money.  There's no reason to buy from John immediately either, as it's the same price.  It's best to see if Alice is willing to negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible, so he's starting with a significant counteroffer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it leaves room for negotiation if Alice rejects it. It also signals to Alice that Bob is serious about getting a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is a decent price for Bob.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise. Buying from John for $12,000 wouldn't be a better deal at this point. It's more beneficial to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that's within his budget and saves him some money."
