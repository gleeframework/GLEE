"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. As we're just starting our negotiation, I'd like to make a reasonable offer to get us started. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $8,750. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $8,750 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. How about we settle at $7,800?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to make one more concession, though - I'll throw in a premium service package worth $200, which will enhance the product's functionality. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",8600.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, especially the premium service package.  However, I'm still finding it a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $8,000? I feel that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and the added service.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,250. I'm willing to make another concession, though - I'll throw in an additional feature upgrade worth $150, which will further enhance the product's functionality. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",8300.0,Alice,7,
