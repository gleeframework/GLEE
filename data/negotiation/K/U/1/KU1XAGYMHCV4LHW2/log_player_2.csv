"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Reason:Alice's offer is significantly higher than my budget and John's offer. I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 at this time."", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  My counteroffer signals that I'm serious about buying but expect Alice to come down on her price. 
* **Alternative Option:** I still have the option to go with John's offer if Alice doesn't budge enough."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, $13,000 is still above my budget and what John is offering. I'll try to negotiate a bit further, but I'm getting close to the point where John's offer becomes more appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $13,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm keeping it below both her current offer and John's price.
* **Urgency:** By now, Alice likely knows I have other options.  Offering a price closer to John's might encourage her to close the deal. 
* **Potential Final Offer:** Depending on Alice's response, I may be ready to accept John's offer if I can't get closer to $11,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $12,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm:** Her message suggests she won't go lower than $12,500.
* **John's price is better:**  John offers the product for $12,000, which is a guaranteed saving of $500.
* **No guarantee of further negotiation:**  Continuing with Alice might not yield a better price, and risks losing the deal with John altogether. 

At this point, it makes the most financial sense to buy from John."
