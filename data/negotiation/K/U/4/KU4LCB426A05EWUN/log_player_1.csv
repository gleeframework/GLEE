Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $950,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider a reasonable price. I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I still believe the product is worth less than $1,050,000 to me. I would like to propose a price of $1,020,000. I hope this is within your range of expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,020,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price, and with only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000."
