"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to the price I'm comfortable with.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000, so how about we go with $8,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm definitely willing to make this work.  But $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we try $8,900? That's only $150 more than your last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let's seal the deal!",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to making a decision, but $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to add another $50 to my previous offer, so how about we go with $8,800? I think that's the best compromise we can reach.",8800.0,Bob,6,
