Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I know would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $12,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still presenting a very attractive offer to Bob (saving him $3,000).

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob, capitalizing on his higher perceived value of the product."
