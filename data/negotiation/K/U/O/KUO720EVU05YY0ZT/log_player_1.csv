{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that's reasonable for both of us.  It gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I earn more than my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price more around $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $130 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $135? It's a fair middle ground, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $130 again? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has stuck to his price point, and while it's not my ideal price, it's still higher than my minimum acceptable price.  Negotiating further is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome, and it risks losing the sale altogether.  Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit and move on."
