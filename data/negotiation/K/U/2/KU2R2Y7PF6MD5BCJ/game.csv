"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're firm on the price Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you do $1,100,000? That's the highest I can go.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I can do $1,250,000, which is a good deal considering the value you'll get from the product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
