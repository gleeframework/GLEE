# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our unique product to you. This extraordinary item holds immense value to us, and we believe it would be equally beneficial to you. We are offering this product to you at a special price of $950,000, reflecting its true worth and ensuring you receive an exceptional deal. We are confident that once you experience the product, you will appreciate its quality and value even more. Let's discuss further to bring this opportunity to fruition. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above your desired price range. There's room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. To make this deal work, I'm willing to pay $800,000. This would be a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. We understand your budgetary constraints and appreciate your willingness to engage in this discussion.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is within my budget and a good compromise. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
