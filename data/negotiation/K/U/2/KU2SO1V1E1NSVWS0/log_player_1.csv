"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my desired price and his perceived value. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is considerably below its true worth and potential.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,200,000? This reflects the product's value while still offering you a significant return on your investment."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000. How about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

While closer, $1,100,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure this deal reflects the true value of the product.  Would you consider $1,175,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,175,000. How about $1,137,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,137,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,137,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is consistently meeting in the middle, and while I'd prefer a higher price,  $1,137,500 is a strong profit. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer further or the negotiation stalling."
