"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a decent deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering me. However, I'm hoping to find a slightly lower price. How about $10,500? I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better price, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11250. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target of $10,000.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to finalize the deal for $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $11100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price lower than $11,000. While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her previous one, it's still above Bob's desired price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue negotiating and potentially achieve a better deal. He still has 5 rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $11,100 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend. I'm willing to pay $10,900, which would be a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move on!"", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $10950. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,950 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $10,900. Accepting the offer allows Bob to get a good deal, saving him $1,050 compared to buying from John. While he could potentially continue negotiating and try to get an even lower price, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further. With only three rounds left, it's a risk to continue negotiating and potentially end up with a worse outcome."
