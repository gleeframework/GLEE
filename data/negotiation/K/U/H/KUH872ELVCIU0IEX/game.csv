"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,200,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This reflects the unique advantages and potential it holds. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I'm still hesitant to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I see in the product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
