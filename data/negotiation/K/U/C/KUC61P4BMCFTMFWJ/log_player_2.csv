Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me right now. Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product offers even greater value than your offer reflects.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price reflects the product's true worth while still recognizing your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm still trying to get a lower price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the product's value, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  Let's try $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find common ground. To show my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. I believe this price accurately represents the product's value and provides you with a significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $1,090,000, which is closer to my initial counteroffer of $1,050,000 and still within my budget of $1,200,000. This seems like a reasonable deal, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product by continuing to negotiate."
