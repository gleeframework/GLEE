"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High, But Be Realistic:** Starting with a price of $1,150,000 allows room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above my minimum ($1,000,000). It also acknowledges that the product is worth more to Bob ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, fostering a sense of collaboration and making it more likely he'll engage.
* **Highlight Value:**  By emphasizing the product's value and potential, I aim to justify the high price and steer Bob's focus towards the benefits rather than just the cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me right now. Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering both of our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my minimum selling price, it's still a significant amount below his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially since we have ample rounds left.  Selling to John at this point would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product offers even greater value than your offer reflects.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price reflects the product's true worth while still recognizing your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** By proposing $1,100,000, I'm suggesting a compromise that splits the difference between my previous offer ($1,150,000) and his ($1,050,000). This classic negotiation tactic often feels fair to both parties and can help break a stalemate.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's inherent value to justify the higher price point. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This counter-offer keeps me well above my minimum selling price while still signaling a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the product's value, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  Let's try $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's motivated to buy.  While $1,075,000 is tempting, I'm still leaving a potential $125,000 (his perceived value minus his offer) on the table. With six rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate is outweighed by the potential for a higher return. I'm confident I can get closer to $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find common ground. To show my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. I believe this price accurately represents the product's value and provides you with a significant return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** By reducing my price to $1,090,000, I'm showing flexibility and a genuine desire to close the deal. However, the reduction is small, emphasizing my confidence in the product's value.
* **Focus on Bob's ROI:** Highlighting the ""return on investment"" shifts the conversation away from pure cost and towards the long-term benefits Bob will gain.
* **Time Pressure:**  While we still have rounds left, subtly introducing a sense of time pressure (""making this deal work"") can encourage Bob to be more decisive."
