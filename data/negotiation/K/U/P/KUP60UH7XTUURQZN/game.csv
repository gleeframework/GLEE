"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $12,000. I know it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you, and it's a valuable asset to me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,
