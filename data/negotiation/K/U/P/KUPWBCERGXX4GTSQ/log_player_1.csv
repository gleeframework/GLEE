Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to  purchase it for $800,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However,  $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000 to reach a fair deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer means losing a potential $100,000. It's time to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
