Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $825,000 is still above my minimum of $800,000 and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to counteroffer."
