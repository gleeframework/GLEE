"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. I believe it's a great value, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to give myself room for negotiation.  
* **Showing flexibility:**  I'm emphasizing that I'm open to negotiating to encourage Bob to counteroffer.
* **Building a relationship:** The message is friendly and aims to establish a rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $1400000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 9 rounds left, and I can use this time to try and push for a higher price. 
* **Staying flexible:**  Rejecting Bob's offer doesn't mean I'm not interested, it just means I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value.  $1,400,000 is definitely closer to what I'm looking for, but I need to be a bit closer to $1,500,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference at $1,450,000? "", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce the price point. 
* **Remaining firm but flexible:**  I'm staying firm on my desired price point but still open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $1425000. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **More negotiation room:** We've narrowed the gap significantly, but I believe there's still room for a small increase with more negotiation.
* **Time on my side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I can afford to be patient and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to compromise.  $1,425,000 is definitely closer to where we need to be.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more to $1,435,000, but I need to be fairly close to that number.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1435000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant increase:** I'm increasing my offer by a smaller amount this time to show that I'm getting closer to accepting a deal.
* **Emphasizing compromise:** I'm reiterating that I've already compromised to show I'm being reasonable.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm still leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, but I'm setting a clear lower limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final price of $1430000. This represents a compromise that I believe is fair for both parties.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  With only 4 rounds left, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away.
* **Time is running out:**  Accepting the offer ensures a sale at a price close to my desired minimum, and I can always explore other options in the future."
