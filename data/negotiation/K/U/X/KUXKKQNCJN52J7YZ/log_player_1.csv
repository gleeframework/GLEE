Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested but wants to feel like he's getting a slightly better deal. 
* **Above Bob's Value:**  While the price is above Bob's perceived value ($100), it's close enough that he might be willing to pay a premium if the product is something he wants or needs. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know how much Bob is actually willing to pay. If you had more information about Bob's willingness to pay, you could potentially adjust your offer for a higher profit."
