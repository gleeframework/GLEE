"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to meet Alice somewhere in the middle. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also aiming for a price closer to her valuation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we're still a good bit away from a price I'd consider a ""deal."" I'll try one more counter-offer before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. To be honest, $10,750 is the highest I can go. If that works, I'm ready to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 10750
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

* **Firm but Fair:**  This offer shows I'm serious but also sets a firm limit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning I'm ""ready to close"" adds a little pressure for Alice to accept.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price is still a decent savings for me if she accepts, but I'm mentally prepared to go with John if she rejects it."
