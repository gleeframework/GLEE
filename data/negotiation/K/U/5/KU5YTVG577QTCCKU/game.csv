"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its worth to me and the potential opportunity you have to close a deal quickly.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. Considering its worth to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. This is a good deal for both of us, allowing you to sell quickly and me to get a product I'm interested in.  Let's try to find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell at $850,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $975,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be convinced that this is a deal that works for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $975,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on it and will allow us to close this deal quickly.  Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell at $900,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. I'm willing to give you a small discount to get the deal done, but I need to be convinced that this is a deal that works for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $910,000 for the product. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",910000.0,Bob,8,
