Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $170. This price is above his perceived value but allows for some potential negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value, but I'm willing to negotiate if necessary.  I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $150, so I won't accept anything lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum value. While it's tempting to take the $140, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $160. This is a compromise, and I hope it will convince Bob to accept. I am willing to accept $150 for the product as I can sell it to John for that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has increased his offer to $145, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150."
