"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget, I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair, reflecting the value to me while allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which still allows for a good return on my investment. Let's find a way to bridge this gap so we can both be happy with the deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a good return, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to go up to $860,000, which is a compromise from my previous offer.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",860000.0,Bob,4,
