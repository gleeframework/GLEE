Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I'm selling. I'm asking for $200 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies flexibility and that I'm open to a counteroffer. 

**Why this strategy:**

* **Maximizes Potential Profit:** Starting high gives me the best chance of getting a higher price.
* **Sets the Stage for Negotiation:** This approach establishes a starting point for bargaining. 
* **Avoids Immediate Rejection:**  A lower starting price might make Bob think the product is not worth much, leading to an immediate rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe I can come to an agreement at a lower price. How about $175? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $175 is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit.  There's always a risk in continuing to negotiate, and this offer represents a good middle ground."
