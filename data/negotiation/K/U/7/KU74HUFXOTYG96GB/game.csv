"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to find a fair deal,  $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $1,075,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
