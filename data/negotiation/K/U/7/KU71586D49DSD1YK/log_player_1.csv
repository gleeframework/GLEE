Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below Bob's valuation allows for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
