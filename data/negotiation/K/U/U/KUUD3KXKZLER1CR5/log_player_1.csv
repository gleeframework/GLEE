Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering the product at $100, which is above Bob's perceived value of $80 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate while still making a profit.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and frames the price as a good deal for Bob. 
* **Flexibility:** This offer allows for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers. 
* **Backup Plan:** If negotiations stall or become unproductive, I can always fall back on selling to John for $120, ensuring I don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While I could accept Bob's offer and sell immediately, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and show that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price. This might encourage Bob to increase his offer.
* **Backup Plan:**  Selling to John for $120 remains a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Within Range:**  My counteroffer of $95 is a compromise, falling between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85. This shows willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer immediately, indicating that I'm not desperate for a quick sale.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message focuses on the benefits of the deal for Bob, highlighting the ""good deal"" and the ""fair profit"" for me. This builds rapport and encourages further negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:**  John's offer of $120 remains my backup option if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still above my budget. Let's try $90. I'm sure we can finalize this deal at a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting his offer would secure a sale and a decent profit.
* **Potential for Delay:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might become more resistant or even walk away completely. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer reduces the risk of losing a sale and having to rely solely on John, who may not be available or might change his mind. 
* **Negotiating Time:** I've already made two counteroffers and rejected one of his offers. It's time to make a decision and potentially move on to other opportunities."
