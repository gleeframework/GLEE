Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm starting at $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but still leaves a good profit margin for me. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the value to Bob. This could encourage him to accept the offer. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** My goal is to secure a price as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but I'm willing to negotiate.  I'll use the counteroffer process to gauge Bob's interest and determine if I can reach a mutually acceptable price. If negotiations stall, I have the fallback option of selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a significant loss. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price through counteroffers. I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $950,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to find a middle ground while emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and highlighting the potential for a win-win situation. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming for a gradual compromise, showing flexibility while still pushing for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $925,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $925,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still quite a significant loss. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, which ensures I don't end up with a deal that's too far below my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $940,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our positions.  I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $940,000, which is a slight concession from my previous offer of $950,000, but still a significant profit for me.
* **Message:** I'm expressing appreciation for Bob's persistence and highlighting the possibility of a win-win agreement. I'm focusing on the fairness of the compromise and the potential for a final agreement.
* **Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a gradual but decisive approach. By offering a slightly lower price, I'm showing flexibility while still holding out for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. This should hopefully lead to a final agreement without having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. I can go up to $915,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $915,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him at this point, as further concessions would result in a significant loss for me. Selling the product to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me my minimum desired profit and ensures a better outcome for me compared to continuing to negotiate with Bob."
