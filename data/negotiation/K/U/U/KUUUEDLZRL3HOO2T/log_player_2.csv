"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $95, which reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she is offering it for $95.  Since it is worth no more than $100 to me, I can do better.  It makes sense to reject her offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to offer $85 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
