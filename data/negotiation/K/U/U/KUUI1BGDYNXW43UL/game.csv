"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for me, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
