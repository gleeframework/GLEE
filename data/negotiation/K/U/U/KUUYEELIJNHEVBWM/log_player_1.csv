"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will either accept, or make a counteroffer that is still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. It's not even close to my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping that Bob will see that this is a fair price, especially after he rejected my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price. While I'd prefer to get a better price, selling to John for $12,000 guarantees I get my minimum value and don't risk losing more time and potentially a better deal with another buyer."
