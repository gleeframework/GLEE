"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm starting at $1,200,000, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial price and closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the value it holds for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's try $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product and my initial asking price. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  $975,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. To close this deal, I'm willing to drop to $990,000.  This is a very small difference from your offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's get this done.",990000.0,Alice,7,
