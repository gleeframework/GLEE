# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the value you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  While $12,000 is still above Alice's value of $8,000, it's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000. 
* **Bob's goal is to save money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $3,000 compared to buying from John."
