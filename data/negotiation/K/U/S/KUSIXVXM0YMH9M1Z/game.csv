"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While that price is tempting, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your budget constraints. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for being transparent about your limit, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product for $1,050,000. This is as close as I can get to your limit while still ensuring I earn a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
