"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I can meet you in the middle at $110. Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $95. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $98. I can meet you at $105, but I'm not budging further. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",105.0,Alice,7,
