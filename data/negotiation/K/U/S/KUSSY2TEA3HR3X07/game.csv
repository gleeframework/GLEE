"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11000. How about we meet at $10800? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $10800 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $10900. This is my final offer.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10800 and $10900, which would be $10850. Can you consider this?",10850.0,Bob,6,
