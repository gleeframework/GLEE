"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great return on investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000, but I can also offer a compromise at $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,000,000. Would you be open to that?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still a bit far apart from $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,000,000, which would be $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
