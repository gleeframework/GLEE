{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's above my minimum price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum.**  This gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **It's below Bob's maximum value.** This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting your initial offer.

However, be prepared to negotiate further if Bob counters!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I will counter Bob's offer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, as you're getting the product for less than its full value to you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10,500 is a good price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,500, $9,800 is still a good deal for me. It's significantly higher than selling to John and is within the range of a reasonable compromise.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
