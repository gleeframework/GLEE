"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10500. This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9800 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10200, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
