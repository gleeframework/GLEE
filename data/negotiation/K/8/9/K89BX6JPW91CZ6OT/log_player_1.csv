Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay this price, and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $80. This is below my minimum value of $100, and I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll counteroffer with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm countering with a price of $120. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows a willingness to compromise. It's also closer to my minimum value, so I'm hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $100, I'm going to choose option (3) and sell the product to John. This ensures I get my minimum value and avoids further negotiation."
