Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $13,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000 is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation.** It's higher than my minimum but allows for potential compromise. 
* **The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product.** This helps build rapport and sets a positive tone.
* **I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer.**  This shows I'm open to negotiation and prevents him from feeling pressured into accepting my first offer. 

By starting with this offer, I maximize my chances of getting a price close to my desired outcome, while also leaving room for flexibility in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price that's closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to make this deal happen. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a price closer to my desired outcome:** $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering it's worth $15,000 to him, but it's closer to my $13,000 starting point. 
* **Reiterate the value of the product:**  Mentioning the value helps justify the price and keeps the focus on the positive aspects of the product.
* **Express willingness to compromise:** ""To make this deal happen"" shows I'm flexible and open to finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Keep the tone positive:** The message remains friendly and encouraging, avoiding any hostility that could derail the negotiation."
