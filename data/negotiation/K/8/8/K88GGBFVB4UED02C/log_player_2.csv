"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than her valuation of the product ($800,000). There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $800,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to reach an agreement. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still above her valuation of $800,000. There's still room for negotiation. I can try to push for a lower price, potentially closer to $850,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm counteroffering at $885,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $885,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $875,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away and me having to buy from John for $1,000,000 is too high. Accepting this offer saves me $115,000 compared to buying from John, and it's a good deal for both of us."
