"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects a fair value for both of us, considering the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $800,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to reach an agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair price considering your valuation of the product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm counteroffering at $885,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,5,
