Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $107.50 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to go down to $112.50.  This is a fair price and a good compromise. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:

``` 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably, and further haggling might irritate her and risk losing the deal.  $112.50 is a good price, saving $7.50 off John's price."
