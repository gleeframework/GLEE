Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, at $11,000, to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum of $10,000 as possible, but I need to be prepared to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. I'm hoping to get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept."

{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $10,000.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price, and accept.  If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as we are getting down to the wire."
