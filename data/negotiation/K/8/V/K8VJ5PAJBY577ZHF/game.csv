"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $15,000.  This reflects a more realistic market value.",15000.0,Alice,3,
