"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity but $850,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, as I believe that's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $810,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $810,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm going to offer $780,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. I'm hopeful we can close this deal.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you a price of $795,000, which is a slight increase from your last offer. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle soon.",795000.0,Alice,5,
