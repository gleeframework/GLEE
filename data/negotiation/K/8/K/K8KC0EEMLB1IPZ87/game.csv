,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1050000. This price takes into account the value you've placed on the product, while still ensuring I get a fair return on my investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1050000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it's the limit of my budget. I believe this price still reflects the potential value of the product for me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept $1000000 as it's still below my minimum target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll offer it to you for $1100000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to be close to your target price, and I'm still very interested in this product.  However, $1100000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, which is a significant investment for me.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering it to you for $1100000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll meet you at $1075000, which is the closest I can get to my target without compromising my minimum price. This is my final offer.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
