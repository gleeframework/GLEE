"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a great product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I have to be honest, the product is worth more than $900000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can sell it to you for $1100000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1100000. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be careful not to lose too much value. I can sell it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. Can you consider this offer?",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better price, Bob. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be careful not to lose too much value. I can sell it to you for $1025000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $1025000. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I'd like to make a serious offer. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're serious about making a deal, Bob. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I can sell it to you for $987500. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",987500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $987500. I'm willing to pay $925000 for the product, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800000. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if it's not a good value for me.",925000.0,Bob,10,
