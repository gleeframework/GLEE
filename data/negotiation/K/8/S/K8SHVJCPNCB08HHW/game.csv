"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1350000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1150000. I believe that's a more reasonable price given the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1150000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $1250000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1100000. That's my final offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but this product is truly exceptional and I'm not sure we can reach a mutually agreeable price at this point. I'm going to have to decline your offer, but I'm willing to offer one final counteroffer at $1175000. I'm not willing to go lower than this.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product to you.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $1100000. I've already gone as high as I can. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, but no more.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
