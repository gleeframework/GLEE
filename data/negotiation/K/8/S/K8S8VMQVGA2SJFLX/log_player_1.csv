Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where I'm aiming for a significant profit, but also leaves room for negotiation. Bob is likely to counteroffer, and I'll be prepared to adjust based on his response. However, I'm keeping my minimum acceptable price in mind â€“ I'll only accept a price that nets me at least $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my target price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still leaving room for some profit. My goal is to find a price point that's agreeable to Bob while still ensuring I get a decent return on my investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my initial target, it's getting closer and represents a significant profit.  I'm going to accept his offer, as continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely.  $1,075,000 is a good outcome, considering the alternative is selling to John for $1,000,000."
