You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  He should counteroffer Alice with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

Bob is offering $12,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still within Bob's budget. It leaves room for negotiation, but also shows Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget than her initial offer, it's still too high. He can still get the product for $10,000 from John, and there's a good chance he can negotiate a lower price with Alice. He should counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

Bob is offering $13,500, which is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows that he is willing to negotiate but also that he won't overpay. It's still a good deal for him, as he can get the product for $10,000 from John if this doesn't work out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, but $15,500 is still too high. Bob has already made a counteroffer and it was rejected, suggesting that Alice is unlikely to drop further. It's time to cut his losses and buy from John for $10,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
