Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $132.50, which is slightly higher than your offer but still a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and while $132.50 isn't ideal, it's still a better deal than buying from John.  There's a good chance you can't get it much lower, so accepting the offer is the best strategy."
