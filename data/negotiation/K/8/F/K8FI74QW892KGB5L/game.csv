"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the immense value it will bring to your business.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't afford that price.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. This is my best offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to get the best price, but $1,800,000 is still too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but I'm not going any higher. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to compromise. I appreciate you moving closer to my position.  To be fair, I'm also willing to adjust. How about we settle at $1,500,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budget constraints.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford. Let's split the difference and settle at $1,250,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
