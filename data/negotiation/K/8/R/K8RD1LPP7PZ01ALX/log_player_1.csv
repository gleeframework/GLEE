"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000.  This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but still leaves room for him to pay more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from him in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John for $10,000 is a safe option and guarantees I meet my minimum profit."
