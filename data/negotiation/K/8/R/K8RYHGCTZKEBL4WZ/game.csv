"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're eager to close the deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm starting to get concerned that we might not reach an agreement. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
