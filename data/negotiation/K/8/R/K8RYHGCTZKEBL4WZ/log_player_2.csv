Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're eager to close the deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm starting to get concerned that we might not reach an agreement. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has gone back up to her original offer of $11,500 and is expressing reluctance to move further. It's unlikely she'll come down significantly in the remaining rounds.  At this point, cutting losses and taking the guaranteed deal with John at $12,000 makes the most sense to avoid potentially missing out on the product altogether."
