Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $120 is still too low, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a step closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  How about $140?  That seems fair, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 140}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $130? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than I hoped, it's closer to my minimum price and it avoids the risk of losing him entirely or having to settle for John's lower offer."
