"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $9,750. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,7,
