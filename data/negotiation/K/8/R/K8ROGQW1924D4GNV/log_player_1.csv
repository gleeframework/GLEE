Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $9,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John. This strategy aims for the best-case scenario while having a safety net."
