"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make a deal happen.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,500? I think that's a fair price that benefits us both.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $6,500. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $7,500? This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $7,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could you do $7,000? That would make it much easier for me to say yes.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob, but $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $7,200? This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7200.0,Alice,5,
