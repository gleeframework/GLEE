# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make a deal happen.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $6,500. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $7,500? This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob, but $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $7,200? This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth risking losing the deal with John. Buying from John guarantees the product at your target price of $8,000."
