"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to me is $800,000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
