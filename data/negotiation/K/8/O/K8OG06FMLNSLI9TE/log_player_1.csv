Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value proposition for Bob.  It opens the door for further discussion and negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I aim to get as close to my desired $1,000,000 as possible while still being appealing to Bob.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  By starting at $950,000, I leave room to adjust the price down if needed. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware of John's offer, which acts as a safety net. This gives me the confidence to be firm in my negotiations with Bob.

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While $850,000 is a significant amount, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at. I'm not willing to settle for that price.
* **John's offer is a better alternative.**  By selling to John, I can secure $1,000,000, which is closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for further negotiation.** While rejecting Bob's offer, I'm not completely closing the door.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Preservation:**  I prioritize maximizing my profit and want to get as close to my $1,000,000 goal as possible.
* **Backup Plan:**  John's offer gives me the confidence to reject Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to secure a price closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $900,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:** The message is again friendly and emphasizes mutual benefit. It focuses on finding a ""solution"" that works for both parties. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Strategy:** This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By proposing a midpoint, I'm signaling that I'm open to finding common ground. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Even though I'm lowering my price, I'm still holding firm to a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. 

I believe this counteroffer positions me well for the next round of negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about we try $887,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While he's increased his offer, it's still significantly below my desired price and the value I place on the product. 
* **John's offer is significantly higher.**  Selling to John will secure me $1,000,000, a much more desirable outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation is becoming unproductive.**  Further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a price closer to my desired value.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I'm prioritizing getting the best possible price for my product. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag on, potentially costing me time and ultimately leading to a lower price.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  By selling to John, I'm securing a higher price and avoiding the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

I've decided to accept John's offer, as it offers the most favorable financial outcome for me."
