"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and its potential for you.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,350,000? It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and still leaves you with a good deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but I can't accept $1,275,000. It's still significantly below my minimum.  To make this work, I need to be at $1,325,000. This is a small increase from your last offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to get the best deal I can. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I'm not going any higher. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
