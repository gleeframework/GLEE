"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is $1,500,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still allows me to make a profit while giving you a great price.  Let's meet in the middle!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me is $1,500,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
