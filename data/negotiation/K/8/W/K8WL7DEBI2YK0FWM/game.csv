"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me is no less than $800000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, I'm currently working with a budget of $1000000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that figure?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My counteroffer is $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $1050000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so my counteroffer is $1075000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still slightly over my budget at $1075000.  Let's split the difference and aim for a final price of $1062500.  This would be a fair compromise and allow us to close this deal.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $1062500. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'll make a slight adjustment to my previous offer, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1075000, but only if you're willing to pay the full price. If not, I'm willing to meet you at $1062500. The choice is yours.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
