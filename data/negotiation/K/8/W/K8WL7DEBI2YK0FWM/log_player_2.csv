"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me is no less than $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, I'm currently working with a budget of $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that figure?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My counteroffer is $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further, especially since you have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $1,050,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so my counteroffer is $1075000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your budget, but you can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's still worth seeing if you can bring the price down further. You have several rounds remaining, and John's offer remains as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still slightly over my budget at $1,075,000.  Let's split the difference and aim for a final price of $1,062,500.  This would be a fair compromise and allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1062500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $1062500. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'll make a slight adjustment to my previous offer, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1075000, but only if you're willing to pay the full price. If not, I'm willing to meet you at $1062500. The choice is yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering the product for $1,075,000, but also offering $1,062,500 as a final offer. Since $1,062,500 is within your budget and you only have 3 rounds left, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. You can get a better price than John's offer, and there is a risk that you will not be able to negotiate a better price in the remaining rounds."
