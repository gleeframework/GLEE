"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this fantastic product to you for $14,000. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price ($15,000).**  
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** There's no need to rush and accept an offer that's not beneficial. 
* **You want to save as much money as possible.** It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm prepared to pay $13,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still think $13,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price ($13,000).** 
* **You're still within the negotiation phase and have more rounds to go.**  You have time to try and get a lower price.
* **You're aiming to save as much money as possible.** While a compromise is good, you can likely get closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,250. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $13,200, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great price for a product worth $15,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your desired price range and very close to your last counteroffer.**  You're saving $1,800 compared to buying from John.
* **You're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds.**  There's a risk that pushing for a lower price could lead to a stalemate, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.
* **While you can still try for a lower price, the potential gains are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal.**

At this point, it's a good strategic decision to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
