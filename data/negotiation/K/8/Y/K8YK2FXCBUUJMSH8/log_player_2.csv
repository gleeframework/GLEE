"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $200 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $150.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  How about $130?  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $165? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $165 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still over his limit. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $165 is still outside my range.  Let's try $145.  I'm really hoping to make this work."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
