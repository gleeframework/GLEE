"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,750. This is the best I can do. Can you consider this offer?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,750 is still too far below my bottom line. I'm willing to meet you at $8,900. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close the deal at this price.",8900.0,Alice,5,
