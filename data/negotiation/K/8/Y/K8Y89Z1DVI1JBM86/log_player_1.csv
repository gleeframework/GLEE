Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a decent starting point, allowing for some negotiation room while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'll be closely watching Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing him completely.  Accepting his offer of $90 is the best choice in this situation."
