"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is a decent price, you know you have a backup option at $150. There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one."
