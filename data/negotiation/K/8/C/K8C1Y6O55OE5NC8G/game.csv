"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $16,000 is still too far from my budget.  Could you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $17,000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. While I appreciate you moving down, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $11,000? I feel this is a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $18,000. It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,7,
