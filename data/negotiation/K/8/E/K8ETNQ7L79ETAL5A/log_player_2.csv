"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations with a price of $1,300,000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair starting point.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly lower than what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $1,100,000. This price still reflects a substantial discount for you, and it's a good starting point for further negotiation. Let's find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're making a compromise here, and I appreciate that.  To be frank, $1,000,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  It's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is worth it at that price.  Let me know if this works for you."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to come up to $1,000,000.  However, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. To make this deal work, I need to be at $1,150,000.  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a significant discount on the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It's clear that Alice is unlikely to budge below $1,100,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it makes the most financial sense to take that deal."
