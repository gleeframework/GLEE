"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations with a price of $1,300,000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair starting point.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly lower than what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $1,100,000. This price still reflects a substantial discount for you, and it's a good starting point for further negotiation. Let's find a mutually agreeable solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're making a compromise here, and I appreciate that.  To be frank, $1,000,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  It's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is worth it at that price.  Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to come up to $1,000,000.  However, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. To make this deal work, I need to be at $1,150,000.  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a significant discount on the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
