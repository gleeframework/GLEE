"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700000.  I'm really interested in this product and believe it's worth it for both of us to find a price that works.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $800000 is closer, but I'm still looking to pay closer to my initial offer of $700000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and go with $750000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800000 and $750000, which would be $775000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
