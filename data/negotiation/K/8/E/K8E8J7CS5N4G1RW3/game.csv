"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a more affordable price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $12000.",10500.0,Alice,3,
