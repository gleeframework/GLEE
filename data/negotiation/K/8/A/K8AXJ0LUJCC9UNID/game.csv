"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $130? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in a bonus feature that's worth $10. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the bonus feature, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to throw in another bonus feature that's worth $15, and I'll meet you at $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional bonus feature, but I'm still not willing to go above $110. I'm willing to make a final offer of $112. That's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at $112?",112.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $112. I'm willing to throw in one more bonus feature that's worth $10, and I'll meet you at $122. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",122.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to make one last offer of $115. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120. That's the lowest price I'm willing to pay.",115.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to throw in one more bonus feature that's worth $5, and I'll meet you at $120. It's the same price John is willing to pay, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,9,
