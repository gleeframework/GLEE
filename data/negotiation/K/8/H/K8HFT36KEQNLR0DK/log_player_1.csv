Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've received, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning another buyer (""John"") and framing the offer as time-sensitive, you encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing out on the deal. 
* **Value Justification:** While you don't want to reveal your minimum price ($15,000), hinting at the product's value and the interest from other buyers can justify the higher asking price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation. You have a strong fallback option with John, so don't feel pressured to accept any offer below your minimum."
