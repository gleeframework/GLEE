"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $9,500. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
