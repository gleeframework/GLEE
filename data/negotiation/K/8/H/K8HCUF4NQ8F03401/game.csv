"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and still a significant saving for you. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant concession. Let's try to bridge the gap and find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
