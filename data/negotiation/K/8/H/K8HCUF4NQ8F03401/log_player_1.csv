"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and still a significant saving for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer.  $850,000 is too far below my minimum, and I still have 9 rounds to work with Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant concession. Let's try to bridge the gap and find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $900,000 is a reasonable compromise, and it's getting close to my minimum.  I'm also concerned about running out of rounds and being forced to sell to John for less than I'd like."
