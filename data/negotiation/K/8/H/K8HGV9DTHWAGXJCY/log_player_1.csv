"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high asking price. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I want the best price from Bob, I always have the option of selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that the price is reasonable. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to my target, it's still significantly higher than his stated perceived value. This indicates there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a more favorable price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product offers significant long-term value that I believe justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This offer reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession ($200,000) to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Holding Ground:** However, I'm still above both Bob's offer and my minimum.  The goal is to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm continuing to highlight the product's long-term value, subtly suggesting that Bob may be undervaluing it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:**  Bob has met me halfway between our previous offers. This suggests he's serious about closing the deal and recognizes the product's value.
* **Profitable Outcome:** $1,900,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Time Value:**  While I could push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away.  Closing the deal now ensures a good outcome."
