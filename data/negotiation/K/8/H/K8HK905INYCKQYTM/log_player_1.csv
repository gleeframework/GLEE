{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, which can encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By offering a price that's not my absolute maximum, I create space for Bob to counter without me feeling pressured to immediately accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'll need to gauge his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter again. 
* **Monitor the Time:**  I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $8,000, so I won't spend too long negotiating with Bob if the offers aren't getting close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's counteroffer of $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($8,000), but it's still below my desired price. There's room for further negotiation.
* **Avoiding a Quick Sale:** Selling to John for $8,000 right now is tempting, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal with Bob.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, but still leaves room for compromise. This will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a better price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer to Bob:** I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $10,000, aiming for a price closer to my desired price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  Offering $11,000 shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not settling for too much less than my desired price.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive tone, which can help keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to reinforce why this price is still reasonable.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:** I'll be ready to negotiate further if Bob rejects this offer, but if he accepts, I'll have secured a good price.
* **Decision Point:** If Bob doesn't accept, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or accept John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $11000 is a bit high. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $9500? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It's a significant improvement from his initial offer and represents a good deal for me.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with John's offer of $8,000.
* **Time Factor:**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the more likely it is that other potential buyers might emerge, potentially complicating the situation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalizing the Deal:**  I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale.
* **Moving Forward:**  I'll now focus on fulfilling the terms of the sale and ensuring a smooth transaction."
