``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal while still allowing you to earn significantly more than the $800,000 offer from John. It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. It's a fair price considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob, and also lower than the offer I initially made. I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit off your price.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This gives you a great deal and allows me to get closer to the value of the product. Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go up to $875000 for the product. That's a good compromise for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired price point. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob has shown his willingness to negotiate.  I will counteroffer again."
