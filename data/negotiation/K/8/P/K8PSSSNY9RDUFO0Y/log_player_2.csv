"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $120. I think it's a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a better price than John's $150, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering. There's room for negotiation since the product is worth $100 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about we split the difference at $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I've done some research and I'm willing to go up to $130 for the product. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is better than John's price, Bob can still potentially do better.  There's still a gap between Alice's value ($100) and her offer ($130), indicating more room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $125? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go too much lower, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $135, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the price is getting closer to his limit of $150. Accepting Alice's offer of $135 is a better deal than buying from John for $150.  There's a good chance that further negotiation won't lead to a significantly better price, so it's wise to accept the current offer."
