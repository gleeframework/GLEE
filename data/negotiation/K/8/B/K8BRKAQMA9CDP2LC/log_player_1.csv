Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's value but significantly lower than what I can get from John. It's a good starting point for negotiation, leaving room to potentially find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not worth the risk of further negotiation. I'm confident John will buy it, so I'll sell to him and secure a better price."
