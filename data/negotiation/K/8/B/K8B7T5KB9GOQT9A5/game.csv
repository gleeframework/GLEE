"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for $9,500 to make this deal work. This price still allows you a good margin and is closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can bridge the gap!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. I think that's a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",9250.0,Bob,4,
