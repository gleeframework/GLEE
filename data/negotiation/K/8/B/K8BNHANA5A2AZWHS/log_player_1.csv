"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a good starting point since the product is worth $120 to Bob. I'm also mindful that I can always sell to John for $100 if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject it. I believe I can still get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price to $110. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like more, Bob's offer is only $2 less than what John is offering.  I'm accepting his offer to avoid risking further negotiation and ensure I secure a sale."
