"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is a decent price and below your $15,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell.  You can try to get a better price by rejecting this offer and seeing if she counters with something lower."
