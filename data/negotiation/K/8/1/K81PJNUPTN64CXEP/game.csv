"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what similar items are selling for in the market.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? ",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I was thinking that $725,000 is still a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $725,000, which would be $737,500. What do you think?",737500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we are getting close. I could do $730,000, but that's my limit.",730000.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $730,000, but I need to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we do $735,000? I'm willing to make a slight concession to get a deal done.",735000.0,Alice,7,
