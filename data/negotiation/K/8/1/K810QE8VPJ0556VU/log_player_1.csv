Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price.  I believe there is a range where both of us can benefit from this deal, and I'm willing to negotiate to find it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I believe I can get a better price, so I'll proceed with the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's fair for me. I believe we can reach a mutually agreeable price in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I would prefer to sell to Bob, his offer is getting too close to my minimum value.  I'm confident that John will pay my asking price, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on a better deal."
