Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for that amount. I will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering with my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John for that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to earn more, I'm not willing to continue negotiating down further. Selling to John guarantees me a fair price, and I don't want to risk further haggling with Bob."
