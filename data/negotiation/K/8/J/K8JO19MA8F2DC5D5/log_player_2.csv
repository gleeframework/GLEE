"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, but Alice is asking for $11,000. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **You have 10 rounds.** This gives you time to try and get a better price. 

By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $11,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting lower:** This counteroffer immediately signals your intent to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Reasonable offer:**  $10,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for compromise. It's below your maximum price and still likely above Alice's minimum. 
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and professional tone helps keep the negotiation moving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to make this deal work.  This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above your target price:** While her offer is lower than the initial price, you're still aiming for $10,000. 
* **There's still room to negotiate:** You have 7 rounds left, providing ample opportunity to try and bridge the gap. 
* **John's offer is still a backup:** You have the option to buy from John for $12,000 if you can't get a better deal with Alice.

By rejecting the offer, you can continue to negotiate and attempt to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,250.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, showing you're willing to work towards a deal. It's also a  realistic price point given your target and Alice's previous offer.
* **Maintain the positive tone:** Keep the conversation friendly and professional, encouraging Alice to continue negotiating. 
* **Room for adjustment:**  This leaves some room for Alice to counter again if necessary without going too far below your target price."
