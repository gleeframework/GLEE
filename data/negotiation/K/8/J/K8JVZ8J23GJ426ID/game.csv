"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and this price reflects a fair compromise. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1,200,000. Let me know your decision.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
