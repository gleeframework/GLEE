"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be really valuable to you. I know it's worth at least $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move forward with buying from John and save $2,000."
