You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

Alice's offer is the best possible price you can get, saving you $1,000 compared to buying from John.  There's no reason to risk a counteroffer and potentially lose the deal or have to buy from John at a higher price."
