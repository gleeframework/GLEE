Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have valuable information: the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. This allows you to aim higher than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While a price closer to $1,000,000 might seem tempting, starting with $925,000 leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit.
* **The John Factor:** You have a safety net. If Bob rejects your offer, you can still sell to John for $800,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize your profit with Bob. However, a slightly lower offer might increase the likelihood of a quick and successful sale if you prioritize speed over maximizing every possible dollar."
