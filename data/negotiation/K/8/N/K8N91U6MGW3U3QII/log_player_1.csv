"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate, but it's still fair considering my own value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $125. This is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  It gives me a chance to see if we can reach an agreement before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  I believe we can still reach a more favorable price, and I want to see if he's willing to go higher. If not, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $120. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept.  If he doesn't, I'll sell to John in the next round."
