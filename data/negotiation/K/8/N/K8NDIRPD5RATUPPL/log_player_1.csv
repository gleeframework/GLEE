Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $10,500? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

While $10,000 is a decent offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my ideal price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a bit short. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is the maximum I can afford. Can you consider that?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  We've been going back and forth with Bob for a while, and it seems like we're stuck.  While $9,500 is a decent offer, it's still a significant distance from what I'm hoping to get for the product.  It's time to move on and get the best possible price for my product."
