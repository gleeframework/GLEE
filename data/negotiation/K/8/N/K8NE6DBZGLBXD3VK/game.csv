"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price of $800,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your position, but $800,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,200,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel that it's too high. Could we aim for $950,000 instead?",950000.0,Bob,4,
