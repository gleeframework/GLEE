"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price given the value you've placed on it. Let's try to find common ground here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand where you're coming from.  While I value the product, my budget is firm.  Would you be open to $1,300,000? That's a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my seriousness about this purchase.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I can't go any lower than $1,450,000. This is a substantial investment for you, and I believe it still reflects the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I see the value in your product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about $1,375,000?  That's right in the middle of our last two offers and feels like a fair compromise.",1375000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I really appreciate your persistence in this negotiation. Let's aim for a final agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. I hope we can finalize this deal!",1400000.0,Alice,7,
