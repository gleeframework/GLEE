"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to consider this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $825,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let's find a way to make this work.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $775,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my absolute lowest price. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that John is also willing to pay this amount. Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
