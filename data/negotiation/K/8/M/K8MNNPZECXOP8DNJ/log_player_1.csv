Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200, knowing that my minimum is $150. This gives me some room to negotiate and see if Bob is genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to get $150, I'm not willing to sell it for that price right away.  I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $160. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  it's a good deal considering my minimum was $150, and I risk getting nothing if I keep negotiating."
