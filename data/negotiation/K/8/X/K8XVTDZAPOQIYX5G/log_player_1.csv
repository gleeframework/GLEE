Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $8,625. Would you be willing to consider this price?

**Reasoning:**

While it's tempting to hold out for more, Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground. At $8,625, the offer is still a significant profit above your minimum ($8,000). Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or no sale later."
