"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is better than $12,000, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($8,000). This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,250. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible. While $9,250 is better than $12,000, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price (which would be closer to Alice's value of $8,000).  There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer again and try to push for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $8,750.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $9,100. I think this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been trying to get the price down to $8,750, but Alice is firm at $9,100.  It's a slight compromise on Alice's part, and the price is still below Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($12,000).  It's a reasonable deal for Bob. Accepting the offer allows him to secure the product for a good price without further negotiation."
