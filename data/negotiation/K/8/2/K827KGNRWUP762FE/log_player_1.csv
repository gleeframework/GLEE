"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum value, but I'm hoping Bob might be willing to pay a lot for the product.  This is a good starting point to see how much negotiating room I have."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable value, Bob's offer is exactly that - the minimum. I'm not in a rush and I believe I can get more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is still a good profit margin for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than his offer. I hope this will be a good compromise and move us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm not willing to go below my minimum value. While I can sell to John for $1,200,000, I'm going to see if I can get a better price from Bob first. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price that is more reasonable for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I hope this shows Bob that I am willing to be flexible and find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. 

Bob's offers are getting increasingly unreasonable. I'm not willing to drop below my minimum value, and it seems unlikely he will come up to it.  I've already lost some time trying to negotiate with him.  John is a guaranteed sale, and at this point, it's the best course of action."
