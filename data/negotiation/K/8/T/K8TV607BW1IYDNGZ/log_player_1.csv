"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but well above my minimum ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The initial offer helps gauge Bob's eagerness and provides insight into his negotiation style. His response will inform my next move.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback. If negotiations with Bob stall or become unreasonable, I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask and his perceived value. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter in the next round to try and find a middle ground closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value to me is quite significant. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,110,000?"",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, Not Capitulation:** I'm moving closer to the middle ground but not conceding too much. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value. 
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's significance to me, I'm subtly reminding Bob of its worth and why a higher price is justified. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  I'm keeping the offer above $1,100,000, signaling that I'm serious about obtaining a good deal. We still have rounds to go, and I'm betting on Bob's interest to drive further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which is a good sign he is willing to negotiate. However, his latest offer is still below my target range. I'm confident that with more rounds, I can either push him closer to $1.1 million or accept his offer if it gets closer to $1,090,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle - $1,090,000, and we have a deal?"",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiations, and Bob has steadily increased his offer. This indicates his interest in the product and willingness to make a deal.
* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's a significant concession on my part, landing almost exactly between our last two offers. This shows flexibility while still securing a price well above my minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By framing this as a final offer, I'm encouraging Bob to make a decision and capitalize on a favorable price. This also leaves me with some room to negotiate slightly further up if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. Based on our previous offers, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,085,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's increments are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll move significantly closer to my $1,090,000 target.
* **Strong Offer:**  $1,085,000 is still a substantial profit above my $1,000,000 minimum and a respectable outcome considering our negotiations. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but it also risks pushing Bob away or stalling the deal. Accepting now secures a great profit and allows me to move on."
