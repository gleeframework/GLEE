"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but no higher. Can we meet at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see we're getting closer. While I value your continued interest, I'm still not quite at the point where I can accept your offer.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,100,000. This represents a fair compromise and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go with $1,025,000. Can we shake on it at this price?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're definitely getting closer.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will make for a successful transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go with $1,012,500. Can we finalize the deal at this price?",1012500.0,Bob,8,
