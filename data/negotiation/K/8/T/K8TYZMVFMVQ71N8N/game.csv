"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own a truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and represents a great investment for you.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the product's value, $1,150,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This offer reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can find common ground.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down, $1,090,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. I'm running out of time, and John's offer is always on the table.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
