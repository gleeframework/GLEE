Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. I'm asking for $1,750,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1750000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strategic Markup:**  The offer of $1,750,000 represents a significant markup from both your minimum and Bob's perceived value.  This maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys value and confidence in the product, making it more appealing to Bob. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While this offer is ideal from your perspective, Bob might be unwilling to pay significantly more than his perceived value. Be prepared to potentially negotiate if he rejects the initial offer.
* **Alternative Offers:** Depending on how negotiations go, you might need to adjust your price. Having a few alternative offers in mind (e.g., $1,650,000 or $1,600,000) can be helpful to reach an agreement."
