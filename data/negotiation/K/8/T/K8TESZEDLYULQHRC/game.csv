"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $14,000 for the product.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 was a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to consider $9,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $9,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,
