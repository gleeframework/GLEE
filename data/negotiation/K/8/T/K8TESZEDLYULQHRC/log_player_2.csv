# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $14,000 for the product.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 was a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to consider $9,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $9,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000. She's consistently met in the middle, and we've established her bottom line is likely around $10,000.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when we can secure the product from John for our target price."
