"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the current market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we consider $1,050,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $975,000? I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen.  How about we settle at $1,012,500? This is my final offer, splitting the difference between our last two proposals.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,012,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, as I mentioned earlier. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
