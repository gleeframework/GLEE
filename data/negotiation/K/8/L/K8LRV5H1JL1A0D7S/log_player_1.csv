Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, but not too far above it. This allows for negotiation room while still being relatively aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum valuation of $8,000.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired outcome in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering $8,500, which is halfway between Bob's offer and my minimum valuation. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still maintain a reasonable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum valuation, so I'll accept it.  It's not ideal, but it's the best I can get from Bob, and it's better than selling to John for the same price."
