"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's too risky to accept this offer.  Bob should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I can offer it to you for $15,000. This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from $18,000 to $15,000, it's still above Bob's budget.  He should continue to negotiate for a lower price.  He can either counteroffer or consider buying from John at a later round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,000?  I think this would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but the value of this product is substantial.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above Bob's budget.  While it's closer, Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a better price.  He's already rejected several offers and has the option to buy from John, so he has leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $11,000, which is a significant compromise.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
