"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's tempting to accept, Bob can likely do better by negotiating.  There's a significant gap between Alice's asking price and Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:**  This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial price, signaling Bob's seriousness about negotiating. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:**  $900,000 is still a decent profit for Alice, considering her own valuation of $800,000. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  There's still room for both parties to compromise and find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $1,000,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a step in the right direction, it's still too high for Bob. He can likely negotiate a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer. Bob still has plenty of rounds left and can continue to try and drive the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Compromise:** Bob is showing he's willing to meet Alice halfway, but also not completely caving to her demands.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $950,000 is a good compromise, leaving room for Alice to profit while allowing Bob to save significant money.
* **Pushing for a Deal:** This offer suggests Bob is serious about buying the product, but still trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This price is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can make it work. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $980,000 is getting very close to Bob's desired price point.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or even reject future counteroffers.  Accepting the offer at this point allows Bob to secure the product at a price that is significantly lower than John's offer, and still allows for a comfortable profit margin.  It's a good balance between securing the deal and getting a good price."
