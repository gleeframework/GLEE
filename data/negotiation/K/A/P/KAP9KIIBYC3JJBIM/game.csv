"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. ",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13000.
