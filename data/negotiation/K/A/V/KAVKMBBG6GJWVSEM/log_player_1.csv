"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since I don't know Bob's value, I'll see if he's willing to bite. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I need to aim for a much higher price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it well above my minimum. Hopefully, this shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating, but also that I'm not willing to give it away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $600,000 is better than his previous offer, it's still far below what I need. I'm not desperate to sell, and I can get a better price from John. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm getting closer to the point where I'll just sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum but I still want to see if Bob will budge. This offer is a significant drop from my previous one, but I'm hoping to entice him with a slightly more reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below what I need, and I'm running out of time.  I've lowered my price significantly and Bob doesn't seem willing to meet me halfway. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
