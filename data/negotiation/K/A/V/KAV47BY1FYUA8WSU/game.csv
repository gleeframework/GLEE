"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm prepared to pay $10000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000.  It's a fair price that gives you a great deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
