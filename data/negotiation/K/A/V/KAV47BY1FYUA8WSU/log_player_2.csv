"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15000 to you, and I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can do better than $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000.  It's a fair price that gives you a great deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$11,000 is a good price for you.  You are saving $4,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a better deal."
