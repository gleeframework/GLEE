"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and establish a starting point for negotiation. I want to see if he's seriously interested in the product and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more from Bob.  I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to raise his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still remaining above my minimum acceptable value. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also trying to ensure I receive a fair price.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable counteroffer and be more likely to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has raised his offer to $1,100,000, which is closer to my desired price range. While I would like to push for more, I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, I might not get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  Since it's above my minimum, I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid risking a lower price with John."
