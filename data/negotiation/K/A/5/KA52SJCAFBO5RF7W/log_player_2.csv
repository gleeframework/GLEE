"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns.  I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair for both of us. Please consider my offer carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum price point of $1,000,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy for Bob, even though it means paying a slightly higher price."
