{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still significantly more than Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within the realm of possibility considering Alice values the product at $1,200,000. This initial counteroffer is intended to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his budget.  He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a better deal.  The counteroffer from Alice shows she's willing to negotiate, and Bob can use that to his advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $900,000. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product and is willing to compromise.  It's still significantly lower than Alice's offer, but potentially closer to a point where both parties could be satisfied."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her offer to $950,000, which is within Bob's budget and a better deal than buying from John for $800,000. While Bob would prefer a lower price, accepting this offer saves him $50,000 and secures the product.  It's a reasonable compromise considering the negotiation process."
