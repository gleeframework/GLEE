"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, Alice's initial offer leaves no room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice.  He's starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's value to see if she's willing to budge.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for further concessions if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than his maximum price of $12,000 and allows him to save $500 compared to buying from John. While there's potential for further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal to John or going through more rounds outweighs the potential for a slightly better price."
