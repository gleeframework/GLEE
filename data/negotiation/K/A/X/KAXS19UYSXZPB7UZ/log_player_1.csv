Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $120 as possible while still making the sale to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is the initial offer, there might be a small window for Bob to counter-offer slightly higher, still landing you above your minimum.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Adding a ""limited time"" element creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept quickly."
