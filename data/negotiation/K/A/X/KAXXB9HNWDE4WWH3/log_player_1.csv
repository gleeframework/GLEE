Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""immense potential"" and ""significant benefits"" of the product to justify the high price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The tone remains open for discussion (""Let me know your thoughts"") allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.  

The goal is to secure the highest possible price from Bob, knowing that the $1,500,000 from John serves as a strong fallback position."
