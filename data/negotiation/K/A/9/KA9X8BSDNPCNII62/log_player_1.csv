Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price, but one that's still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a substantial profit.  I'm confident I can reach a mutually agreeable price before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for.  I believe I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm confident that $1,050,000 is a fair price for both of us, and I believe Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. I'm worried that if I keep going back and forth, I'll waste time and might end up with an even lower price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and I'm not willing to risk losing that."
