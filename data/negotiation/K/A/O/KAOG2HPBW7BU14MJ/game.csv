"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $12,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob.  However, the value of this product to me is quite high, and $12,000 is a significant drop. Could you meet me halfway at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering what I know about the product and what it's worth to you.",12500.0,Bob,4,
