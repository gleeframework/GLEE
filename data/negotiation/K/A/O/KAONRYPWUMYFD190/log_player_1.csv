**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly refusing to budge much beyond $900,000.  It's clear he's highly unlikely to reach a price point acceptable to Alice (above $1,200,000).  Rather than wasting further rounds and potentially getting stuck with a worse offer, it's in Alice's best interest to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
