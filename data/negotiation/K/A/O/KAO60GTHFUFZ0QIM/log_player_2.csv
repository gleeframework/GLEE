"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's something I know you'll find incredibly valuable. My asking price is $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You can potentially get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice. You have a good buffer before needing to buy from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating is the best option."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a little, however. I'll accept $900,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $900,000 is still above your ideal price.  There's room for further negotiation, and you can potentially get the product for closer to your $850,000 target. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can reach a more favorable price."
