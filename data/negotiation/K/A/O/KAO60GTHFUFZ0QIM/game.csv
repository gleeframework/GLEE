"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's something I know you'll find incredibly valuable. My asking price is $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering your value for it, and it gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a little, however. I'll accept $900,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a certain price, but I'm still not quite there.  $900,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you $875,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,
