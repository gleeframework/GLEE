Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum budget of $800,000. This is a significant reduction from her initial offer and reflects the value I place on the product. I'm hoping Alice will consider this offer, recognizing that it's my final price point and a better alternative than selling to John for the same price."

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice $900,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging that she lowered her price but also showing my willingness to pay more than my initial offer. It's a middle ground that could be attractive to Alice if she's willing to make a deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above my budget of $800,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will keep rejecting my offers, and I could end up spending more than I'm comfortable with.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John at my maximum price point."
