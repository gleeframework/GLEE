Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects my desire for a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,999 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's highly motivated, but still ensures we get a price very close to our guaranteed sale price from John.
* **Create Urgency (Implied):**  By not revealing we have another buyer, Bob might feel the need to act quickly, preventing him from dwelling too long on the difference between our offer and his perceived value. 

**It's a delicate balance:** We're aiming high to maximize profit, but not so high that Bob automatically rejects the offer."
