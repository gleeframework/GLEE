Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than what you'd get elsewhere. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting ripped off.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate down if Bob doesn't accept the initial price.
* **It leaves room for John:** You can still sell to John for $120 if Bob doesn't accept the deal. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum price of $120.  It's worth accepting since it's likely I won't get a better offer from Bob, and selling to John for $120 would take longer."
