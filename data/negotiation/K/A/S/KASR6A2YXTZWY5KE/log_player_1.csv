Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a rare chance to acquire something truly unique."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Offering it at $1,500,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation.  
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value"" and ""uniqueness"" to justify the high price.  

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a significant profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:** This opens the door for you to potentially still sell it above $1,000,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John at your guaranteed price.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential profit while still having a safety net with John."
