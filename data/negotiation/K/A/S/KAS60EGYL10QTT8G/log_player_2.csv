Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $95, which is $100. Let's call it a day at $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than this. You've successfully negotiated her down to her own value for the product. Accepting this offer prevents you from potentially missing out and having to buy from John at the same price."
