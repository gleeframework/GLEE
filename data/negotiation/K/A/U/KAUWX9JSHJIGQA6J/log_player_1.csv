{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I need to close the deal,  $1,200,000 is my absolute minimum. I still have time to try to get a better price from Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1250000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. I've reached a point where I'm worried about the potential for further negotiations to stall.  With John offering a guaranteed $1,200,000, it's safer to sell to him now.  I can always try to get a better deal in the future if the opportunity arises."
