"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting with an offer of $1400000. Let's discuss!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer to make this work.  How about we split the difference and go with $1300000?  This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1250000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 still doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be at $1280000 to make this deal.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
