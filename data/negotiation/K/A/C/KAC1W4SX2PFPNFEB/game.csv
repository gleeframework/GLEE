"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15500 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $16750? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, and still be a great deal for you.",16750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $16750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16000. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",16000.0,Bob,4,
