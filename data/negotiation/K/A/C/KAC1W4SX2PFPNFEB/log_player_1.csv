"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I can still try to get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,500 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $16,750? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, and still be a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 16750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $16750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16000. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $16,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so this is a solid outcome."
