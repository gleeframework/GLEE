"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 14000} 

I'm starting high, aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly below my minimum value. While selling to John would be the safest option, I want to see if I can still get closer to my desired price through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,000, still higher than Bob's offer but showing flexibility. This should hopefully get us closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $11,000. While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum value. We're already halfway through the rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn."
