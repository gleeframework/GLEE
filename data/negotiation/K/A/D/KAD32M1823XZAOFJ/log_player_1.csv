Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me some room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $11,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my minimum acceptable price. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I've already spent a few rounds negotiating and I'm not sure how much lower he's willing to go.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids any further negotiation."
