Round 5
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball, and her latest offer still puts her above your maximum budget.  While you could continue negotiating, she's signaled this is her ""final offer"" and going lower might push her to walk away. You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price, so it's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
