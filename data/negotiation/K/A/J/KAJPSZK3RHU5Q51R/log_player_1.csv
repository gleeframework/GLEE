Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I know it's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offering a discount:** I'm offering a $3,000 discount on the product's value to me, which is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. This increases the likelihood of him accepting.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to me to make the offer seem more attractive.
* **Giving Bob a reason to buy:** By suggesting that this is a good deal, I'm giving Bob a reason to think about it. 
* **Leaving the decision to Bob:**  I'm not putting any pressure on Bob to accept, allowing him to consider the offer.

This strategy aims to balance getting a good price while maximizing the chances of Bob accepting the offer.  If he rejects, I can still sell it to John for my minimum price."
