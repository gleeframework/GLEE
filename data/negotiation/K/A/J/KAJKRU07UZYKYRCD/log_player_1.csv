{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), so I'm not risking selling to John just yet. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob room to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. It also opens the door for me to potentially get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and also below my initial offer of $13,500.  
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I still have room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Avoiding selling to John:** While $15,000 is my ideal price, selling to John right now would mean leaving money on the table if I can get a better price from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price halfway between Bob's offer ($11,000) and my previous offer ($13,500). This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Still above minimum:** $12,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), ensuring I'm not settling for less than I'm comfortable with.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to move forward with the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,800, which is the highest I can go. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $11,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **John's offer:** It's getting close to John's offer, but I'm not desperate yet. There's still room for Bob to increase his offer slightly.
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send one more counteroffer and try to get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $11,800 is still a little too low for me.  If you're serious about getting this product, how about we settle for $12,200?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase:**  I'm only increasing my offer by $400, showing that I'm willing to compromise but also holding firm on a price close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Final offer:**  This counteroffer is presented as a final offer to put pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  The message is still friendly and encourages Bob to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to my budget, but I'm not willing to go above $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if you can meet me at this price. Can you do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $12,000 is only $3,000 less than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **No room for further negotiation:** Bob has made it clear he won't go higher, and there's no point in further rounds of counteroffers.
* **Guaranteed sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, ensuring I don't lose out on potential profit. 

Although I'd prefer to sell for a higher price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob and the potential for a lower final price outweigh the potential benefit of a slightly higher offer from Bob."
