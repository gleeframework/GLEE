"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I see the value you'd gain, $650,000 is significantly below its worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is substantial, and $750,000 is still too low. My final offer is $875,000.  This is a fair price considering its potential.",875000.0,Alice,5,
