"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. While I see the value you'd gain, $650,000 is significantly below its worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is substantial, and $750,000 is still too low. My final offer is $875,000.  This is a fair price considering its potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go below $875,000 and I can get the product for $800,000 from John. It's time to cut my losses and get the product from John."
