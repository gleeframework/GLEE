It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  You have room to go lower than $1,000,000 and still get a good deal."

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is a good price.  There's always the risk of going another round and getting her to go lower, but there's also the risk she'll walk away and you'll be stuck buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting $950,000 is a solid deal."
