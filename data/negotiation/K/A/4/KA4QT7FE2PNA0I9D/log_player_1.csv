Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no incentive to go lower. Offering it to Bob at your minimum acceptable price maximizes potential profit.
* **Direct Approach:**  The message is straightforward, highlighting the product's value and the exclusive nature of the offer to encourage Bob to consider it seriously. 
* **No Negotiation Room (Implied):**  While not explicitly stated, the message implies a firm price. This can be effective as it positions the offer as valuable and time-sensitive."
