"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product is appealing, $12,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer of $10,500.  How about we split the difference and I pay $11,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11,750? This is the lowest price I can consider, and I'm willing to be flexible no more than that.",11750.0,Alice,5,
