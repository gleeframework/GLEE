"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is far too high for me.  I'm willing to pay a fair price for this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair starting point given the value I place on the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept. Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $1,900,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a good deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,550,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
