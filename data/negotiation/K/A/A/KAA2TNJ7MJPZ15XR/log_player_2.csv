"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,750?  It's a fair price, and it allows you to get the product for a good value while still giving me a fair deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While $10,750 is closer to my target, I'm not comfortable with it. I can purchase the product from John for a lower price, so I will buy from him."
