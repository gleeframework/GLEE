Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:**  My message highlights the product's value to Bob, making him more likely to consider my offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I don't want to be too aggressive and risk Bob immediately rejecting my offer.
* **Backup plan:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Room for counter-offer:** I can counter-offer with a price higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer, hoping to reach a compromise.
* **John is a good backup:** I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,750?  It's a fair price, and it allows you to get the product for a good value while still giving me a fair deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate and meet halfway.
* **Appealing to fairness:**  I highlight the ""fairness"" of the price, implying that it benefits both of us.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still above Bob's perceived value, but the offer is closer to his offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **John is the safety net:** I can still walk away and sell to John if Bob rejects this offer."
