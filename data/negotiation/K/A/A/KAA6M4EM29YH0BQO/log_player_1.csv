Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and above Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is upbeat and focuses on the value proposition. This makes the offer more appealing.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The price leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, which is likely to happen. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation.
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* If Bob's counteroffer is acceptable or if negotiations stall, I can always fall back on John's $100 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Fair:**  Bob's offer of $100 is at my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I could try to squeeze a little more out of Bob, it's not worth risking a stalemate and losing the sale.  
* **Time is Money:**  I can immediately sell the product to Bob and move on, minimizing any potential loss of time in further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and complete the sale."
