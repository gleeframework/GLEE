**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget.  I'll start by rejecting her offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming to get a better deal. This price is still within my budget and gives Alice room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point.  I'm going to reject her offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget and still a fair price for Alice.  Hopefully, she'll accept and we can finalize the deal."
