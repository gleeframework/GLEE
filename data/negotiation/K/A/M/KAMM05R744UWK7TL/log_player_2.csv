"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $10,000, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm ready to offer you $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is fair for both parties. He starts with a counteroffer that is halfway between Alice's offer and his own ideal price. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but also that he's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8750. It's a fair price considering its value to you and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is within Bob's acceptable range of $10,000. While Bob could potentially continue negotiating and try to get a lower price, there's no guarantee he will succeed. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees Bob gets the product for a price that is within his budget and saves him $1,250 compared to buying from John."
