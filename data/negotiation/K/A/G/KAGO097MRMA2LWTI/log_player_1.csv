Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below its true value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still lower than Bob's estimated value. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm highlighting the value Bob would gain by purchasing the product at this price. This encourages him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation, which is important for a successful negotiation process. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! I've made a good profit. 
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if I want to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer.
* **No Agreement:** If we can't agree, I'll sell to John for $8,000 to avoid losing all profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the maximum I can go. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is still within my acceptable range, but I believe I can get closer to my target of $12,000.
* **Opportunity to Negotiate:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $8,000 guarantees a sale, I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations to see if I can secure a higher price.

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $10,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still be getting a great deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows good faith and makes me seem reasonable.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating that even at $11,000, Bob is getting a good deal based on the product's worth to him.
* **Staying Firm:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving away too much. I'm sticking to a price that's still above my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Fantastic! We've reached an agreement.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll need to carefully consider Bob's next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer.
* **No Agreement:** If we can't reach a mutually agreeable price, I'll sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me is $15000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is only $500 away from my previous counteroffer of $11,000. This is a significant step closer to my desired price point.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving me with only the $8,000 offer from John.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that's considerably higher than my minimum, and significantly closer to my target price.

**Next Step:** I've successfully sold the product to Bob at a good price."
