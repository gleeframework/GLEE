{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which I believe holds significant value, for $2,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I make it clear I'm willing to discuss the price, but I'm not giving away the product for less than $1,500,000 (my minimum).

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth negotiating further. If not, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I'd like to try to get it down to $1550000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is only $50,000 above my minimum price. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, there's a significant risk that we won't reach an agreement.  I'm not comfortable risking losing the sale and having to start over with a new buyer.  

**Decision:**

I've decided to sell the product to John for my minimum price of $1,500,000.  It's a guaranteed sale, and I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future who will be willing to pay a higher price."
