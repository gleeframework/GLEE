Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sorry, but $11,000 is still beyond my budget. I truly appreciate your efforts, but I believe we've reached our limits. I'll go ahead and purchase the product from John for $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob is signaling that he won't go above $10,000. He's even using John's offer as leverage. It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a better outcome."
