"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm starting with an offer of $20000.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $10,000. He has 9 rounds to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $17,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He has several rounds left to negotiate, and there's a good chance he can get a price closer to his desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $13,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going below $16000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is lower than previous offers, it's still higher than his budget. He has several rounds left to negotiate, and with each round, the negotiation is getting closer to his desired price. There's a chance he can get a price closer to his target of $10,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $12,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close the deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12000}
