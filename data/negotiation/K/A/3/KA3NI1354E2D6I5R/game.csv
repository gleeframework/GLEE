"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. ",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $17000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $13500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going below $16000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $12000.  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close the deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",12000.0,Bob,6,
