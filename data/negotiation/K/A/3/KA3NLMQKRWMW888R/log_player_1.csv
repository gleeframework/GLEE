Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I am not asking for my full minimum of $12,000, so there is room for Bob to counter-offer without feeling like I'm being unreasonable. 
* **The backup plan:** I'm always aware that I can sell to John for $12,000. If Bob refuses my initial offer, I'll have to decide whether his counter-offer is worth more than John's guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm not sure if you can do that, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum of $12,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** Even though Bob is willing to meet in the middle, there's a good chance I can get closer to my goal by rejecting his offer and making a counter-offer. 
* **The backup plan is still available:** I can still sell to John for $12,000, which makes this rejection a low-risk move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go any lower than $9,500.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer close to Bob's offer:** My counter-offer is only $500 above Bob's offer, showing flexibility and demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $9,500 is still above my minimum of $12,000, so I'm still earning a decent profit.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I've maintained my bargaining power.  If Bob rejects my counter-offer, I can still choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $9,000 is getting close to my minimum of $12,000. 
* **High chance of rejection:**  If I reject Bob's offer and make a counter-offer, there's a high chance he'll reject it again.  He's already shown he's firm on his budget.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  The fact that I can sell to John for $12,000 means I'm not taking a huge risk by accepting Bob's offer. It's a solid deal that secures a sale and gets me closer to my goal."
