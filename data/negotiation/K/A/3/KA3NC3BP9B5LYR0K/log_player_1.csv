Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $1,200,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Gauging interest:**  A high initial offer allows you to see how serious Bob is about the product. His response will give you valuable information for further negotiation.
* **Psychological impact:** A million-dollar figure creates a perception of high value and exclusivity. 

**Important Note:**  Be prepared to negotiate. If Bob rejects the initial offer, be ready to lower the price strategically. You can gradually decrease your asking price, always keeping in mind your $800,000 safety net with John."
