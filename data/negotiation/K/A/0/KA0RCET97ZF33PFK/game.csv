"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the previous round.

This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a price that's closer to the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you at $1280000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I think we can finalize the deal.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
