"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,900,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product's value is significantly higher than $1,000,000.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a substantial concession, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,700,000 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually beneficial price.  While $1,200,000 is closer to its value, I'm offering a price of $1,500,000.  This is a significant price reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to close this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to come to a fair price. However, $1,500,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is a compromise that I believe is fair to both of us. Let's try to find a common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
