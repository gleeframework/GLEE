{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise, a bit closer to Bob's offer but still a significant profit for me. I'm hoping this price will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but still allows for some room for negotiation if he decides to counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $15,000, and it's close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it.  It's better to secure a sale at a good price than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with John's offer or no sale at all."
