"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $150.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $40. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $40
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$40 is way too low!  I'm not going to sell it for that. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is still above my minimum of $150, but it's a significant decrease from my initial offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still offering far too low.  I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again to $160. This shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but I'm still not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm hoping this will lead to a more reasonable counteroffer from Bob in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to pay a fair price for the product. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm running the risk of wasting more time without a better offer. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150 to ensure I don't lose out completely."
