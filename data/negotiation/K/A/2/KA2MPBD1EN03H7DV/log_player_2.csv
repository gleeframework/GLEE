"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $15000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it holds significant value for you.  If you're interested, let's discuss further. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay a maximum of $15,000. Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is your maximum. However, she mentions selling it to another buyer for $12,000. This suggests she might be willing to negotiate lower. 

By rejecting her offer, you can potentially get a better deal from Alice or buy it from John for the same price.  You have nothing to lose by rejecting and trying to negotiate."
