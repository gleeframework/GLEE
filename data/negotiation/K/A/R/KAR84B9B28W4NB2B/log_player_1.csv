Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. 
* **Understand Your Alternative:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so any offer above that is already profitable.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer doesn't have to be the final price. It opens the door for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price within a profitable range for you.

**Important Note:** While this strategy aims to maximize profit, it's crucial to consider Bob's potential reaction. An excessively high offer might discourage him from negotiating altogether."
