Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also want to save as much as possible. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to negotiate further."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going all in with my final offer at $800,000. This is my absolute limit, and it matches what I can get from John. I'm hoping Alice will accept this final offer to avoid losing the sale completely."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting close, it's still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I'm better off buying from John for $800,000 and ensuring I get the product within my budget."
