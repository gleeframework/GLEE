Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he got a deal.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair price, and I'm open to discussing it further if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,450,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate.
* **Confident Tone:**  The language is positive and emphasizes the product's value.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  While firm, you signal a willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or even reject it outright.  Your strong alternative with John allows you to be firm in your negotiations."
