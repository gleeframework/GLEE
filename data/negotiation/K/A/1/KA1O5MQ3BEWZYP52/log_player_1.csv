Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it gives him some room to negotiate.  It also leaves me some flexibility to potentially drop the price a bit if needed.  I'm willing to accept John's offer of $150 if the negotiation with Bob fails, so I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $160 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's very close and  it would be better than selling to John for $150. Additionally, if I continue to reject offers, I risk Bob walking away entirely, which would leave me with only John's offer."
