"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $7500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $6000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $7250. It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a fair price.",7250.0,Alice,5,
