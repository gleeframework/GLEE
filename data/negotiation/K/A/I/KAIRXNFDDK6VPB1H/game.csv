"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for it. I believe this is a fair price, considering my needs and your desire to sell. What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your willingness to pay $13,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll still get a great value from the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I think this is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  What do you say?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,500. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.
