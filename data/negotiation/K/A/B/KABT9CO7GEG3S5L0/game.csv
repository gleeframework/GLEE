"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,275,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still see a great return on your investment. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,275,000 is a bit steep. How about we try $1,225,000 again? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
