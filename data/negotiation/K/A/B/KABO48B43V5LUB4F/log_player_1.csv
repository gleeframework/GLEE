Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You're not giving it away for less than your minimum, ensuring you get a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's a good starting point for bargaining:**  You can adjust the price up or down based on Bob's reaction.

Remember, the key to negotiation is finding a price that works for both parties!"
