Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights.  I'm willing to make a special offer at $1,450,000. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which it will be unavailable."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Alice anchors the negotiation close to her guaranteed value ($1,500,000) to aim high. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below her guaranteed price leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity can nudge Bob towards a decision. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  Alice hints at the product's value to Bob without revealing her absolute bottom line.

This strategy allows Alice to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:** She aims for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
2. **Secure a Sale:**  If Bob values the product enough and the deadline motivates him, he might accept.
3. **Fallback Option:** If Bob declines, Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her desired price."
