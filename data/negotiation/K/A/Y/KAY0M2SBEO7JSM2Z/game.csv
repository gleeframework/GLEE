"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to keep the cost under $80 if possible. Would you consider a price closer to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a price I can feel good about.",137.5,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. How about we aim for $120? It's a bit closer to my budget while still being a fair deal for you.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again, but $120 is still a bit too low.  How about we go with $130?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.",130.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $125. It's a step closer to my budget, and I believe it's a reasonable price for the product.",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $125, but I'm still a little bit away from where I need to be.  Let's see if we can find common ground at $135.  This would ensure a fair deal for both of us, and I know you'll be very happy with the product.  What do you think?",135.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I've considered your proposal, but I'm still aiming for something closer to my budget. How about $130? It's a bit lower than your last offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise.",130.0,Bob,8,
