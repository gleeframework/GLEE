"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, your starting price is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price given my  valuation and allows for some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's value to me is considerably higher, and $850,000 falls significantly short of that. I'm willing to meet you halfway to demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $975,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. What are your thoughts?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  While I appreciate the compromise, $975,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant jump from my previous offer and hopefully demonstrates my sincerity in wanting to close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and see you're serious about acquiring this.  While your offer is tempting, I believe the product's inherent value warrants a price closer to my previous proposal.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $962,500, which represents a very small margin for me.  I'm hopeful this can be the final point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",962500.0,Alice,7,
