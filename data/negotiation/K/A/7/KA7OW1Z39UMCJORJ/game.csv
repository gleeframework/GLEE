"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product has unique qualities that justify a premium price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has unique qualities, but I still think $1,300,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,280,000. This reflects my desire to make a deal, while still acknowledging the true value of this product.",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,280,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,220,000, but I need to be closer to my target price. Can we meet at $1,240,000?",1240000.0,Bob,6,
