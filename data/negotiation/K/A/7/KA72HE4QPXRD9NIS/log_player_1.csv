{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This provides some wiggle room for counteroffers.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This ensures Bob understands the terms and can easily respond.

By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm hoping to trigger a negotiation process where we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm always ready to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at such a price. However, I believe we can come to an even better agreement. I am willing to offer $10800 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than his initial perceived value, it's still too low for me. I'm going to try to get a better price by counteroffering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $10,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,200. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11200}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,200.  This is still above my minimum, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer.  If he doesn't, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer. I am willing to increase my offer to $11000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to drop to $11,100 as a final offer.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think?"", ""product_price"": 11100}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,100. This is my final offer before I move on to John.  This price is very close to my minimum, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and agree to it.  I'm trying to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and ending the negotiation successfully."
