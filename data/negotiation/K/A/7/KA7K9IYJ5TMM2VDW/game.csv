"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me. While I do see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for you and a great deal for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
