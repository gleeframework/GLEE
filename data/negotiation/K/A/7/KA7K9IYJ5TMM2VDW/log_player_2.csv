"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Reason:  While $900,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better. He has a clear upper limit of $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me. While I do see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for you and a great deal for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason: Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than her initial offer of $900,000 and still well within Bob's budget of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking the possibility of Alice walking away or needing to negotiate further."
