"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $13,000.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $13,000 is quite a bit below my bottom line. Could you do $18,000?  I'm confident you'll see it's value at that price.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand it's a great product, but $18,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,4,
