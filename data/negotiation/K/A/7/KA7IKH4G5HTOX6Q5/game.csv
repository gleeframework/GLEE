"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference at $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find it a worthwhile deal.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you want to make a profit, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $112. Can you meet me at that price?",112.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down to $113.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's make this deal happen!",113.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $113 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $111. Can you meet me at that price?",111.0,Bob,6,
