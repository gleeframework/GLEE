"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to me, but I understand its value may be different to you. Considering its quality and features, I would like to offer it to you for $140. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low a price as possible, ideally below $120.  Alice's initial offer of $140 is too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you understanding my value for the product. While the product seems interesting, $140 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a calculated risk here. He's offering a price that's closer to his maximum limit but still lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows he's serious about buying but also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
