Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring I get significantly more than John's offer.
* **Guarantee a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob rejects my offer, I have John's guaranteed purchase of $1,200,000 as a safety net.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome while minimizing risk."
