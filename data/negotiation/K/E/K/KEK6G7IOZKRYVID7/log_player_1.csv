Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $80 to me, and I can sell it to John for that price. Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold, so I'll reject it and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $70 might be too low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's the same price I could get from John. I'll accept his offer to avoid further negotiations."
