"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference at $13,000? I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than that.",13000.0,Alice,3,
