"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I believe it's worth $1,500,000, but I'm willing to start at $1,400,000.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a more reasonable price. How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000.  This gives you a good price while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That being said, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000. I believe that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're making an effort to find a solution. Let's try $1,050,000. This is a considerable amount for you, and I'm willing to compromise a little further to reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I want to make this work. How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?  That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,025,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's in our best interest to close the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
