Round 7
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,025,000. While we could try to negotiate further, we're running the risk of her becoming less willing to compromise.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000."
