"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
This product is worth $15,000 to Alice and $10,000 to Bob, so Bob can definitely get a better deal. $18,000 is way too high, so it's best to reject the offer and see if Alice will lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at $16,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is better than $18,000, it's still above his budget. He can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice or by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. This offer is a good compromise and allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product at $15,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to a price that's within Bob's budget.  While Bob could continue negotiating, it's likely Alice will continue to offer prices slightly higher than Bob's maximum.  Therefore, the best option is to buy the product from John for $10,000. This ensures Bob gets the product at the best possible price and avoids further negotiation."
