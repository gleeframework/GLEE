Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it would be a good deal for both of us.
