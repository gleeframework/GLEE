"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this valuable product to you for $10,000. It's a steal at this price, considering what it's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum price of $12,000 and it's a better deal than buying from John."
