"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $140 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $150.
* **Strategy:** It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a budget, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $135 out of this deal. Can we discuss further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $135 is still within Bob's budget of $150. 
* **Strategy:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject his counteroffer and the price could potentially go up. Accepting the offer at $135 secures a good deal within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
