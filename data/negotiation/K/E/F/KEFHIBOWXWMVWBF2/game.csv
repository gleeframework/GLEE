"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit below my desired price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still leaves significant room for you to benefit from the product's value, and it allows us to move forward with a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel that $1,350,000 might not fully capture the value of the product. I would like to propose a price of $1,325,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise and allows us to move forward with a transaction that benefits both parties.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
