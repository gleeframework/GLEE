"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better price by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.  This is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's still a profit for her considering her value for the product is $1,500,000. If she rejects this offer, I can move on to John, who will sell me the product for the same price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point.  I'm willing to take the risk of another round of negotiation. I can potentially get Alice closer to my desired price, or at the very least, get a better understanding of her bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, to $900,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to save money compared to Alice's latest offer. I believe this price is still attractive to Alice, considering her value for the product is $1,500,000.  If she rejects this offer, I will move on to John and purchase the product from him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly, but it's still above my comfortable spending limit. I've already made several counteroffers and it seems Alice is unwilling to come down to my target price. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation.  I can secure the product at my desired price and move on to other activities."
