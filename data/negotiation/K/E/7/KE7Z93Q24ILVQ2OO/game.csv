"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price, recognizing your potential interest.  While the product's true worth is considerably higher, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you.  Consider this a chance to acquire something valuable at a price that benefits both of us. Let me know your decision.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
