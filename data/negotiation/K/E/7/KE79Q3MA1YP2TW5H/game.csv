"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $11000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both room to be happy with the deal.  Let's work together to find a solution.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a new offer of $10500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $10500 is still too far off from what I need.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11500. This offer acknowledges your perspective while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us, and I'm eager to reach an agreement.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! I understand your perspective on the price, but $10800 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11200?  It's a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",11200.0,Alice,7,
