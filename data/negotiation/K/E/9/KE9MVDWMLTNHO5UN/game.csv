"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $850,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would still allow me to make a decent profit while giving you a fair price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
