"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $130? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $100, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $115? It's still a good deal, and I think you'll really like the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
