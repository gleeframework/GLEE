Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $12,750? This is still a great price for a product worth a lot more."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer is reasonable, and it's better than selling to John for $15,000. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
