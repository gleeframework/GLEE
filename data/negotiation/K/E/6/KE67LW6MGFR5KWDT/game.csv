"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
