"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a decent profit while still being within Bob's potential value range. I'm also setting a friendly tone to encourage negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value. It's worth continuing negotiation with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum value of $12,000. It's a good deal for me, considering the risk of further negotiations falling through or having to sell to John.  It's time to close the deal and secure the profit."
