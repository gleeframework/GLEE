``` 
 
I'm going to reject Alice's offer.  $10,000 is still too high for me. I want to see if I can get her down closer to my $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject Alice's offer. While $9,500 is getting closer, it's still above my limit. I'm going to see if I can push her down a little further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
