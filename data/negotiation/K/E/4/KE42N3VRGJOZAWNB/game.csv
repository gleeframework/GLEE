"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth so much more. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $9000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $8250. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $7500. I think this is a fair price, considering I've already met you halfway once before. Can you consider this offer?",7500.0,Bob,4,
