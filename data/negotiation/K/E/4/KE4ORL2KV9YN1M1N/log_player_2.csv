"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,100,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a better price from Alice. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  Knowing you can buy from John for $1,200,000 gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but realistic:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer but still acknowledges the product's worth. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** A $950,000 offer gives Alice some room to counter without feeling like she's losing too much.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer helps gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and how much she's willing to drop from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving in the right direction:** Her offer of $1,025,000 is closer to your desired price range, but it's still too high.
* **More room for negotiation:** You have several rounds left, so you can continue to push for a lower price. 
* **John's offer is still a safety net:**  Knowing you can buy from John for $1,200,000 gives you leverage to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  While I'm getting closer to a price that works for me, $1,025,000 is still a bit high. I'm prepared to offer $975,000, which is a fair compromise given our starting points.  Let's try to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but meaningful increase:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet halfway, but still pushes for a lower price. 
* **Focus on compromise:**  The message emphasizes finding common ground and a fair deal for both parties. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice, knowing you can always go to John for $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're getting close.  I understand your position, and I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant progress:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $1,000,000 is within your budget.
* **Final offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, so further negotiation might not be productive.
* **Limited time:** You have limited rounds remaining, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Better than John:**  While John offers the product for $1,200,000, buying from Alice for $1,000,000 saves you $200,000. 

Accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action at this stage."
