Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is a bit higher than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John for $150 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price.  $150 from John is a decent backup option, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $175. This is a compromise between my initial price and his offer, but still higher than John's offer.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a fair price and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $145 is only slightly less than what I could get from John, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the negotiation. It's better to secure a sale now than to risk losing both Bob and John."
