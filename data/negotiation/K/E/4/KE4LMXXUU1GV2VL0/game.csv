"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's find a compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,750?  This would be a win-win for both of us.  What do you say?",12750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come up a bit to $12,000. That's a fair offer considering its value.",12000.0,Bob,6,
