"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $500,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $900,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking!",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch. I'm willing to increase my offer to $600,000. I believe that's a fair price, considering the market value.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $600,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering $1,000,000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm glad we're getting closer. While $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. I hope this demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work.",650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $650,000 is still not enough for me to meet my minimum. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at a price that's closer to my target. I'm counteroffering $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
