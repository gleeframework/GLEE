"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain limit. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I can likely get a higher price by continuing negotiations. My floor is still $1,200,000, and I have 8 rounds left to try and get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. Given the value of the product, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident it's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the market value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is now higher than selling to John, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I have 6 rounds left and can likely get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations. My goal is to earn as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the higher offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,350,000 is still a bit low.  How about $1,380,000? This is a compromise that is fair for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1380000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $1,370,000 as a compromise. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while keeping my expenses reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,370,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,370,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now only $10,000 below my previous offer, and I have only 4 rounds left.  I'm getting closer to my desired price, and with each round, the risk of not getting a deal increases. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale for a price that is significantly higher than selling to John."
