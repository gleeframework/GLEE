"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's priced at $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with a question to keep the conversation open and inviting Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.
* **Exploring Potential:** I want to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and see if he'll go higher. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  While selling to John for $80 is an option, it's not ideal. I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? It's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a margin.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to keep his interest high.
* **Open-ended Question:** I'm keeping the negotiation open by asking for his thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $95 is the best price for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a little more. 
* **Testing Limits:**  I want to see if I can push Bob a bit further and get him closer to my initial price of $95.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $80. I believe there's still a chance I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $90? That's a fair price that ensures we both get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly in the middle of our last two offers.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair"" deal to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise.
* **Closing the Gap:** I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince Bob to accept and avoid going further down in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $90. Would you be willing to consider a price of $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer of $87.50 is only $2.50 away from my minimum acceptable price of $85.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already at round 6, and I've already rejected several offers. There are only 4 rounds left.
* **Avoid Risk:**  I'm not sure if I can push Bob any further, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely and ending up with $80 from John. 

I'm accepting this offer to secure a sale at a price that's only slightly below my desired minimum."
