"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, however. How about $1,300,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to continue doing business with you. Let's try to close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still interested, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000? This gives us both a good deal and keeps the negotiations moving forward.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  How about $1,275,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
