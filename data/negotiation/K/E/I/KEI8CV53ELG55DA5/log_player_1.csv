Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob is interested. I'll be watching his response closely, and I'm prepared to lower the price if needed, but I won't go below $1,000,000, as I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly above Bob's offer. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product while remaining within a reasonable range for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer again. I'm feeling confident that we can reach an agreement before I have to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a small decrease from my previous offer, but it shows my willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal. If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This negotiation has gone on for too long, and Bob's offers keep dropping.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing out on any profit. John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's still above my minimum. It's time to end this negotiation and secure the deal with John."
