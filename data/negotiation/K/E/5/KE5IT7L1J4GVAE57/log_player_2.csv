"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $110. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $110 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for a counter-offer or can proceed to buy from John for $120."
