"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential benefits for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm not starting at my absolute minimum, leaving room for negotiation without immediately resorting to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. There's potential for a better deal through further negotiation.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially push the price higher.
* **Risk Assessment:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum desired price, but I believe I can achieve a better outcome by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $980,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but leaving some space for him to negotiate further.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to justify my price point.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $960,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $960,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** There's still room for Bob to increase his offer, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to secure a better price.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum desired price, but I believe I can potentially get closer to that value with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While I value your offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1 million. How about $975,000?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still holding out for a price closer to my minimum desired price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I reiterate the value of the deal for both of us, emphasizing a win-win scenario.
* **Building Tension:**  I'm subtly increasing the pressure on Bob by hinting at a potential impasse if we don't find common ground soon."

# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $965,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Close Enough:**  While Bob's offer is now closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic and ensure I don't miss out on a better deal.
* **Potential for Improvement:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a higher price.
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John guarantees my minimum, I believe I can potentially close a deal with Bob closer to my desired price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $970,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 970000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle between my previous offer and Bob's, demonstrating a strong desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate the potential profit for Bob, reminding him of the value of the product. 
* **Call to Action:** I use direct language to encourage Bob to accept the offer and close the deal. 
* **Limited Time:** With only 3 rounds left, I'm creating a sense of urgency to push Bob toward a decision."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $962,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 2 rounds left, the time for negotiation is rapidly diminishing.
* **Price Gap:**  Bob's offer of $962,500 is still significantly below my desired minimum price of $1,200,000.  There's not enough time to bridge the gap and reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Guaranteed Return:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and ensures a profitable outcome, regardless of whether Bob increases his offer in the final round.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Given the limited time and the significant price difference, I need to prioritize securing a guaranteed return rather than risking a potential stalemate or a lower price."
