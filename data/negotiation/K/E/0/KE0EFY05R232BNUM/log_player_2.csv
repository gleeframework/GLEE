"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to start with a price of $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $150 is far above your maximum budget of $80. It's best to reject and counteroffer to start the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $150 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $110 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further before accepting or resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to go to $95 yet. I can do $105, which is a bit closer to my minimum price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $105 is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since you have 5 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $100, which is a fair compromise. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not getting any younger, Bob, and I'd like to wrap this up soon. I can do $110, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're really interested, let's meet at $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still outside of my budget.  I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like Alice is unwilling to budge much further. With only 3 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice is too high.  Buying from John guarantees I get the product for my maximum price of $80."
