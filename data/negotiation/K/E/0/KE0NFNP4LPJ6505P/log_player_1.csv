Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  It's also a price that Bob might find attractive, considering the product is worth $100 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering with $90.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still allows me to get a decent price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum acceptable price and lower than I initially hoped for, it's still better than selling to John.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
