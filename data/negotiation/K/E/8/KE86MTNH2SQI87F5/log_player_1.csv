Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. It's also a good starting point to gauge his interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it meets my minimum value, I think I can potentially get more by continuing the negotiation. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a $100,000 reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum value. This should hopefully be attractive enough to Bob to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting too low for my comfort. It's only $100,000 more than my absolute minimum, and I'm not sure I can negotiate any higher with him.  Since John is willing to pay $1,200,000, it's better to secure that deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
