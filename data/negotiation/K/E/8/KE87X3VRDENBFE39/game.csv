"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense. How about $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still far beyond what I'm willing to pay.  I'm serious about buying this product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. If you're willing to come down to $1,100,000, we might have a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I understand you have a budget.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  My final offer is $1,400,000.  This is a significant investment for you, but I truly believe in the value this product will bring.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
