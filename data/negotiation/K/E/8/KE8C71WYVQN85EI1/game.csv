"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on $10,500, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product brings.",11000.0,Alice,5,
