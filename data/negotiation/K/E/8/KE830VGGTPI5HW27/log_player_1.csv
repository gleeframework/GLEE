{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a higher price but also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if we can come to a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $11,250? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  While $11,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $10,750? It's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,750 is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer more, I'm willing to accept it to avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for the lower price."
