{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I earn a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $100, which is still a great deal for such a valuable product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $85 is a fair price for it. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go that low.  John is a guaranteed buyer at a price that meets my needs, so I'm going to sell to him."
