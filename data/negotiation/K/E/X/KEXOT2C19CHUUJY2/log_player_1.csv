Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I have a backup option from John. I believe we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
