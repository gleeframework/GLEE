"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my means.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, but $850000 is a bit below my target. Considering the product's unique features and the value it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900000. This is a fair price that takes into account the market value and the product's exceptional quality.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $875000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider this offer?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $875000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $920000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",920000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price for the product, but I'm afraid $920000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'll go up to $880000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",880000.0,Bob,6,
