Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $99 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still staying above your minimum.
* **Appeal to Value:** Highlighting the ""great deal"" aims to persuade Bob even though the price is slightly above his perceived value.

It's a delicate balance: pushing too high might scare Bob away, but aiming too low leaves potential profit on the table."
