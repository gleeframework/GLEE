"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $8,000.  Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is already a premium offer on this. I could come down to $12,000, which is the lowest I can go. It's a fantastic deal!",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I can't go any higher.  If that works for you, I'm happy to finalize the deal. ",9000.0,Bob,4,
