You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to budge.  $700,000 is a substantial discount from her initial offer, and hopefully, it will entice her to continue negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $725,000 is closer to my goal, it's still above my ideal price point.  I'm going to try another counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 710000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm serious about buying the product, but still aiming for a price below $725,000.  This should keep the negotiation moving forward without sacrificing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $730,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $730,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but $730,000 is still a bit too high. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 720000}
```

I'm going to raise my offer slightly to $720,000. This is a compromise, as it's only $5,000 less than Alice's last offer. I'm hoping this small increase will be enough to encourage Alice to accept, but it's still a good price for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $735,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $735,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We're getting close, but I'm starting to run out of rounds.  Alice's price is still a bit too high, and I don't want to risk going further and having her reject my next offer.  Buying from John for $800,000 ensures I get the product and avoids any further negotiation risk."
