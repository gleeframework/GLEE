Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $750000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1250000?  This reflects a significant price reduction from my initial offer and still allows me to realize a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.
