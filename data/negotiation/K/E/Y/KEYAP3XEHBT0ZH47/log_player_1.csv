Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to haggle you down.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** Offering the product at $125 is a compromise. It allows you to potentially make a profit above your minimum while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider, given his perceived value of $100.
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, if Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John for $150. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation."
