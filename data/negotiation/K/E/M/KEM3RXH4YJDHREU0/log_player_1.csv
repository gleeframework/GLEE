"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is no more than $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price range. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value you've placed on it. Let's find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to consider it! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $10,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a good deal for me, considering my minimum acceptable price is $8,000, and it's still within a range that makes sense for Bob."
