"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7200. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",7200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway between $9500 and $7200. How about we settle on $8400? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.",8400.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7500 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8200? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7800 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go below $8000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $8100? It's the last offer I'm willing to make.",8100.0,Alice,7,
