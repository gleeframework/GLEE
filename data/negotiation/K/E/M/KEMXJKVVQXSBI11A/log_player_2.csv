"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it and it will be worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,000.** This is more than the product is worth to Bob ($8,000).
* **Bob can get the product from John for $10,000.** This is still within Bob's budget, even though it's more than Alice's offer.
* **Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.**  Even though he can save $1,000 by buying from Alice, he can still get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
