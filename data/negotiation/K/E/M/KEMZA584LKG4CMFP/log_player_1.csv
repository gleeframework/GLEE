Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, while still significantly exceeding my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget with this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still secure a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap between our valuations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping this signals my willingness to find a solution while maintaining a profit margin that's more comfortable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a significant improvement over John's offer and is within a reasonable range.  Continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling through entirely, and I'm comfortable securing this sale at $1,500,000."
