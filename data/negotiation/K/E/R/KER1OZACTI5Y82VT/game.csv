"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that 90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 100? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  If we can agree on that, I'll take it.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go down to 95. How about we try again? I'm willing to meet you at 105. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
