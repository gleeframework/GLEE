Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately. This gives me a starting point for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest level. If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffers based on his response. Remember, I have a safety net with John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but still below what I'm aiming for. I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe I can get a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still holding firm on a price above $1,200,000. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and it's a significant improvement over John's offer. I'm confident that I won't get a better price from Bob, so I'll accept his offer to secure the sale."
