"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire it for a price below its true value to you while still allowing me to achieve a significant return. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below the product's worth to you ($1,200,000), it's still higher than what you're willing to pay ($1,000,000). You can get the product for a lower price from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
