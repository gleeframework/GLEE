"Alice, your initial offer is way too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $1000000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
