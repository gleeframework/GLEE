"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a fair price for this product.  Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just not working for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's get this deal done!",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, my budget is closer to $8,700.  If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal. Let me know!",8700.0,Bob,6,
