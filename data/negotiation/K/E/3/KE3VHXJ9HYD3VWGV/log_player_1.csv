"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good negotiating practice to begin with an offer slightly above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" subtly reinforces its worth without explicitly stating the minimum you'd accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""proposing an initial price"" and ""a fair starting point"" signals to Bob that you are willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John.  While his offer is low, it confirms he's very interested. Proceeding to counter-offer keeps the negotiation open for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate you making an effort to find common ground, $900,000 is significantly below the value this product represents. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a very competitive offer considering its unique advantages."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This counteroffer acknowledges Bob's attempt but firmly reiterates that his initial price is unacceptable.  
* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down by $50,000 shows willingness to negotiate but avoids drastic changes.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Again, the message subtly emphasizes the product's value to justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a significant profit over your minimum ($1,000,000) and John's offer. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob is clearly willing to move closer to your price range. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching a stalemate.
* **Time Value:**  While you have rounds remaining, closing the deal sooner provides immediate value and avoids potential delays or complications."
