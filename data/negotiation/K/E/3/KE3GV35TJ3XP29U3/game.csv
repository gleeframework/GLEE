,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see the product.",95.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to run out of patience here.  $82.50 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $90, but that's my final offer.  If you're truly interested in this product, you need to meet me halfway.",90.0,Alice,7,
