"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $900,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet in the middle somewhat? Would you be willing to discuss a price point around $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
