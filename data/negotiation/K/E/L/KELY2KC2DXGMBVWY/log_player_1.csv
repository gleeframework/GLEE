"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 12000} 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me the opportunity to get a good price while also giving Bob a chance to consider a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiations and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering a price that's still above his offer but closer to his valuation. This keeps the negotiation moving and shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is now within a reasonable range. It's important to balance maximizing profit with the potential for the negotiation to drag on further and risk losing the deal completely.  I'm accepting his offer to ensure a sale."
