"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you my product, which is worth at least $1200000 to me. I believe it would be an even greater asset to you, considering its potential value of $1500000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000, a price that is fair for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is ready to pay $1200000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
