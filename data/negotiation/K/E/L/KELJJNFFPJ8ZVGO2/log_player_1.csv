Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I still feel that $700,000 is a reasonable price given my budget constraints. I would like to stick to this figure. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Bob is holding firm at $700,000, which is too low.  We're still far from John's offer, so we'll counteroffer again and see if we can bring Bob up."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm grateful for your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe $700,000 is a fair price. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is clearly anchored at $700,000 and unlikely to budge significantly.  It's not worth risking the sure $800,000 from John for a potentially small increase from Bob."
