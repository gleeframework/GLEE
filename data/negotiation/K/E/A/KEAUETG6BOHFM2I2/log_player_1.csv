Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $150. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While Bob's valuation matches my minimum, his opening offer suggests he might be difficult to negotiate a higher price with. Selling to John guarantees a clean $100 profit without further negotiation."
