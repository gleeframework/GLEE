Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $7,250 again, but I'll throw in a small concession - I'll also include a free accessory that's worth $500. So, the total price would be $7,750 for the product and the accessory. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking around $7,250. Even with the added accessory (which may or may not be truly valuable to you), her offer still ends up being more expensive than John's $8,000.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and further negotiation is not worth the risk of exceeding your $8,000 budget."
