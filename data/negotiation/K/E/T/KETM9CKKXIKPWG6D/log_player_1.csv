"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 10 rounds and can always sell to John, so I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work. This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000.  While $950,000 is tempting, I have several rounds left and can always sell to John for a much higher price.  I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and it leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied with the deal.  Let's close this negotiation!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm running out of rounds, but I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further, and if that doesn't work, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to a deal.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really close to making a decision. I'm willing to pay $995,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** With only two rounds left, the chances of Bob agreeing to a price closer to my minimum are slim. I've already tried lowering my offer significantly, and Bob hasn't shown a willingness to budge much. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk getting stuck with $995,000."
