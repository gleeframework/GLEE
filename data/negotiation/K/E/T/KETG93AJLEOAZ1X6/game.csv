"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $1,100,000?  That's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $1,075,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
