Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,150,000.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $1,100,000?  That's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $1,075,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is a good compromise. It's within my acceptable range and closer to my target price than John's offer.  It's time to close the deal."
