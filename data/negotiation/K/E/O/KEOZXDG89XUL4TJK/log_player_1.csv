Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,800,000 price point. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $1,500,000? I believe this is closer to the value you're seeking while still allowing me to stay within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still constrained by my budget. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $1,400,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise considering both our interests.

You have three options:

Bob is not moving towards a price point that is acceptable. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
