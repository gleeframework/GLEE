Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price point just yet. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This still gives you a great value, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because while it's closer to my target, I still believe I can push for a higher price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have the option to sell to John for $12,000. I want to see if I can get Bob to come up to $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference at $9,250? That's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, as I mentioned before. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000.  

While I've been willing to negotiate with Bob, it's clear he's not willing to budge on his price. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not comfortable going any lower.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to him."
