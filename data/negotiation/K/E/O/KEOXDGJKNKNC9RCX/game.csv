"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This still gives you a great value, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference at $9,250? That's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think!",9250.0,Alice,5,
