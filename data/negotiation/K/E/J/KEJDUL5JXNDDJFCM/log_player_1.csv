Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the product's value to Bob but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and using positive language to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, as this encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Plan B:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I won't be afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still a significant gap between Bob's offer and my desired price.  
* **Potential for a higher offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round.

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but not settle for an unreasonable price.
* **Reiterating the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to further justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive and encouraging:** I'm using positive language and asking for Bob's opinion to keep the negotiation amicable.

This counteroffer balances the need to make a profit with the desire to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough that accepting it might be the best strategy.  I could potentially try to negotiate a slightly higher price in a future round, but there's a risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer and leaving me with John's offer, which is lower.
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that's still profitable for me, minimizing the risk of ending up with a lower price from John.

It's always a balancing act between getting the best possible price and securing a sale. In this case, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible option, considering the factors involved."
