""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming for a price between Bob's value ($1,000,000) and John's offer allows us to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 creates a sense of urgency and positions the product as highly valuable. It's significantly lower than John's offer, making it attractive to Bob while still exceeding Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate,  further increasing our potential profit."
