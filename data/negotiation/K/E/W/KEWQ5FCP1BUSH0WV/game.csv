"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a great price for a product worth much more to you. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
