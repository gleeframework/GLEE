"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth that investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  How about $12,000? I'm serious about buying the product, and that's a fair price considering it's closer to my initial offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $12,000 is still a bit low for me.  Would you consider $13,000? That's a significant compromise on my part, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle on $12,500? That's a fair middle ground, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a little below my target.  Let's split the difference and go with $13,250.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges both of our needs.  What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,7,
