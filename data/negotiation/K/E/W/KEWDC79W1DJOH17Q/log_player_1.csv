Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $100. I believe it would be very valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You are aware that the product is worth $120 to Bob. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $100 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($40) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($20). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob accepts the deal."
