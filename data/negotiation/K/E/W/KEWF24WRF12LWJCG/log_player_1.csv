Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed while maximizing potential profit.
* **Scarcity tactic:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially motivating Bob to accept your offer or negotiate quickly.
* **Focus on value:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product rather than solely focusing on the price. This framing can make the higher price more palatable. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can always adjust your price downwards, but going up from your initial offer is difficult."
