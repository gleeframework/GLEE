Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $100 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering $130.  This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to him, but I'm still willing to walk away if he won't budge much further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum of $120 and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
