"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $19,000.",19000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $19,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it, which is my maximum. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below my minimum.  The product offers a lot of value, and I need to get a fair price for it. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $15,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be honest, I was hoping to get closer to $15,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14,250?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to go a little higher, but $14,250 is still outside my comfort zone. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,750? This would be a fair price for both of us.",13750.0,Bob,6,
