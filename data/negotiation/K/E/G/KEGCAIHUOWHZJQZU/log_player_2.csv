(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can likely get the product for less than $90, so it's worth trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

I'm offering $75, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still willing to try to get the product for less than $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $80, which is still less than Alice's latest offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to keep negotiating, Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum price.  It's a good deal, and I'm likely not going to get much lower."
