"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1100000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1150000? This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we meet in the middle at $1175000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
