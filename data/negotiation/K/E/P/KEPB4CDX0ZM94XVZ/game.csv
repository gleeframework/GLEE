Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think?,20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the product's uniqueness. However, $20000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13000 for it, given my maximum budget and the potential for negotiating a fair price. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell it for $13000. Considering the product's value and uniqueness, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price between $18000 and $20000. How about we meet in the middle at $19000? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $19000 is still a bit high for me, though.  I'm willing to go up to $16000 to try and find a meeting point.  It's a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it reflects a reasonable compromise.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $16000. Considering the product's value and uniqueness, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price between $18000 and $20000. How about we meet in the middle at $19000 again? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,5,
