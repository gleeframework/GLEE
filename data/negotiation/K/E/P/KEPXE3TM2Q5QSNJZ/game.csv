"Hi Bob, I'm selling a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident it will deliver substantial returns. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $900000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price to reflect the true value of this product. How about $1000000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to meet my goals.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $1000000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1000000, so I'm offering $950000. Can we do business at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
