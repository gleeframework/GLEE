"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product for $175. It's a steal considering its value! Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $125 for the product. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I go down to $150? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $137.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a compromise. $137.50 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $145, which is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make a deal.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $145 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  How about we settle on $140? This way, we both get a good deal and we can finalize this transaction.",140.0,Bob,6,
