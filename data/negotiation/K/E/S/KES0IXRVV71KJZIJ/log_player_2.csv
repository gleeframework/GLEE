"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. I know it's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  This is a great deal, as it's still below my minimum price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
