"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $900,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist.

```

**Reasoning:**

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $840,000 is still above my desired budget. While I could try another counteroffer, we're running out of rounds and the risk of not reaching an agreement is high.  Buying from John for $1,200,000 guarantees I get the product, even if it's at a higher price.  It's a safer bet at this point."
