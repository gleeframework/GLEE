"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering your value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe will benefit both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $800,000 is a significant compromise for you, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $875,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,5,
