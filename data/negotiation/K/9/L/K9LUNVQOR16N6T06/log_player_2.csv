"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than $100, there's room for negotiation.  You can likely get the price down closer to your $80 value. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still above her value of $80. This shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than her initial offer and closer to my maximum price.  However, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so I'm going to offer a price slightly higher than my initial counteroffer, but still lower than her current offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but I'm still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, and her offer is now within my acceptable range.  While I could potentially keep negotiating, the likelihood of getting her down to my ideal price of $85 is low. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a reasonable price."
