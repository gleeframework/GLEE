"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000 and Alice's offer is exactly that price. Since you can buy the same product from John for the same price, there's no benefit in accepting Alice's offer. Rejecting allows you to potentially find a better deal or negotiate with Alice later."
