Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a high-quality product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** $14,000 is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to start the negotiation process while still leaving room for compromise. It's crucial to be flexible and adapt to Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Would that be possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to his perceived value of the product, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit, so I'm not willing to accept such a low offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $13,500? This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer to $13,500. This is a compromise that reflects a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone, emphasizing the benefits of the deal for Bob while also reaffirming my need for a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

By demonstrating flexibility and offering a specific counter-proposal, I'm aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward while maintaining my negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $13,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while still being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I am determined to get at least $14,000 for the product. Selling to John is still my most secure option, but I will try one more counter-offer to see if I can push Bob higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to $14,000. Would you consider $13,750? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get what we want."", ""product_price"": 13750} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm raising the price slightly again from Bob's offer to $13,750. This is a compromise that reflects a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone, emphasizing the benefits of the deal for Bob while also reaffirming my need for a higher price. I am also trying to create a sense of urgency by framing it as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**

By demonstrating flexibility and offering a specific counter-proposal, I'm aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward while maintaining my negotiating position. I am also trying to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further. If he rejects this offer, I will likely sell to John to guarantee my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, Alice. I would like to counter with $13,500. This offers a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $14,000.  While I'm open to negotiation,  I've reached a point where the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob outweighs the potential gain.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit of $15,000.  

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I ensure a guaranteed profit. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a stalemate or an outcome that is less favorable than selling to John.  It's important to recognize when to cut losses and secure a guaranteed deal."
