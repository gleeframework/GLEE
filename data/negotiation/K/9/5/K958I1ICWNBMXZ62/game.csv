"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Would that be possible?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $13,500? This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $13,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while still being within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to $14,000. Would you consider $13,750? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get what we want.",13750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, Alice. I would like to counter with $13,500. This offers a reasonable compromise for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,6,
