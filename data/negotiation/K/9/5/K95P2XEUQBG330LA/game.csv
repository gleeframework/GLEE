"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than my minimum. Let's start our negotiation from here.",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,375,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,375,000. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000, which is a fair price for me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, and we're getting closer.  However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $1,350,000. This would be a significant step towards closing the deal, and I'm confident we can make it work.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,350,000. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000, but I'd like to add a condition: I'd like to negotiate the terms of the sale, such as payment terms or a possible warranty. If we can agree on those, I'd be willing to meet you at $1,325,000. What do you think?",1325000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you want to negotiate the terms, and I'm open to discussing them. However,  I'm not comfortable adding those conditions to the current price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,340,000, a price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to move forward without additional complications.  This offer is final, and I'm not willing to negotiate further on the price. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1340000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,340,000. I'm willing to pay $1,320,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.",1320000.0,Bob,8,
