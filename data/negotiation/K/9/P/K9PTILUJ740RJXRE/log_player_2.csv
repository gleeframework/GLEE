"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $115. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is better than $120, it's still above Bob's $100 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $110 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his $100 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $108. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget and has multiple rounds left. While $108 is close to Bob's goal, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He might be able to get Alice to meet his $105 counteroffer or even a slightly lower price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better deal.  I'm willing to go up to $106. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 106} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for the best price, but $106 isn't quite there yet for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $107.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has three rounds left. While $107 is close to his budget, he's already been negotiating for a while and might be better off just buying the product from John for $100. This guarantees he gets the product within his budget without further negotiation."
