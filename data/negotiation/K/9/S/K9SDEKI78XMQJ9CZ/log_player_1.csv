"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $975,000 is still a bit much. How about we split the difference between our last offers and call it $912,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to go up slightly to meet you closer to the middle. Would you consider $890,625? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,625

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is inching up, but we're still in a good negotiating position. We're aiming to stay above $900,000 if possible, and we still have a few rounds to leverage."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting close.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to see this product in the right hands. How about we settle at $917,187? This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 917187
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Pressure:**  By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Slight Concession:** We're showing a willingness to move from our previous offer, but only slightly.  This reinforces that we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Above Target:** This offer still keeps us comfortably above the $900,000 mark, ensuring we're maximizing profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you say that's your final offer, but I'm hoping we can find a number we both like. I'd be willing to close the deal right now for $898,437. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $898,437. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $898,437
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:** We're running out of rounds, and there's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer significantly in the next two rounds. 
* **Profitable Offer:** While slightly below our target, $898,437 is still a substantial profit margin above our minimum ($800,000). It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely and settling for John's offer. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  Bob didn't completely fold after our ""final offer"" but he also didn't dramatically increase his offer. This suggests we've likely pushed him close to his limit."
