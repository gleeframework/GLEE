"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true value. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, the price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start negotiations."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's a negotiation tactic to start with an offer significantly lower than your actual upper limit. This leaves room to bargain and signals to Alice you're looking for a good deal.
* **Not Insulting:** While significantly lower than Alice's ask, $800,000 is still a substantial amount. It shows serious interest while making it clear you won't accept her initial offer.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This first counteroffer will help gauge how much Alice is willing to budge. If she outright rejects it, we'll know we need to move up more aggressively."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognize your perspective on the initial price. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's counter is still significantly above our limit and John's offer. While she came down, it doesn't make sense to accept yet. We need to show we're willing to walk away if we don't get closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,800,000 is still too far from what I had in mind. To be frank, I'm considering other options closer to the $1,000,000 mark. If you can make a more significant adjustment, I'm happy to continue discussing."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:** We're getting closer to the later rounds, so it's time to be more direct. Alice needs to understand our budget is serious.
* **Mentioning Alternatives:**  Without revealing John specifically, we introduce the idea that we have other options. This creates pressure for Alice to be more competitive.
* **Final Offer:** Presenting our $1,000,000 limit directly allows Alice to make an informed decision. It either brings her close enough to make a deal, or it will become clear we need to walk away and pursue John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  To demonstrate that, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. This is a significant move on my part and reflects my genuine desire to do business with you.  Do you think we can work with this? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has come down further, $1,600,000 is still significantly above our $1,000,000 limit. We need to signal that we're serious about the lower price and willing to walk away.  We'll make one more counteroffer before resorting to John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement, but I'm afraid we're at an impasse. My budget is firm, and to be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,000,000. I'm willing to walk away from that and close with you right now for that same price.  If that's not possible, I'll need to pursue the other opportunity."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is our last-ditch effort to secure the product from Alice at our target price. 
* **Transparency and Urgency:** We're being transparent about John's offer (without naming him) to create urgency.  
* **Clear Choice:**  Alice now has a clear choice: match our price and secure the sale, or potentially lose the deal altogether. 
* **Prepared to Walk:** We've signaled our willingness to walk away, showing we're serious about the $1,000,000 limit."
