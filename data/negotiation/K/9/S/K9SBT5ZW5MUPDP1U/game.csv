"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12500.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $13500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",13500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we discuss this further?",13000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My counteroffer is $13750. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and my costs.",13750.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm really struggling to justify spending $13750 on this product. I'm willing to make one final offer of $13200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm starting to get concerned that if we don't meet on this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000. Can we meet in the middle?",13200.0,Bob,6,,
