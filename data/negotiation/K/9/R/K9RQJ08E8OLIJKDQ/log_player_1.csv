"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain a more favorable price.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,600,000, you're setting a high anchor point. Even though Bob's valuation is lower, the initial high price can influence his perception of the product's value.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly states your willingness to negotiate, making you seem flexible and open to finding a mutually beneficial deal.

It's important to remember:  While you have John as a backup, getting a deal with Bob above your minimum ($1,200,000) is the ideal outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's still early in the negotiation. There's potential to secure a better deal.  You'll reject this offer to signal that you value the product higher and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, I believe the product's true potential warrants a higher price.  Would you be willing to consider $1,450,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're making a significant concession from your initial price of $1,600,000 to $1,450,000. This shows Bob you're willing to negotiate.
* **Mid-Point Target:**  This counteroffer aims for a price point roughly in the middle of your initial offer and Bob's offer. This is often a good strategy to find common ground.
* **Positive Language:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing finding a ""fair compromise"" rather than engaging in a contentious back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant profit margin above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. It's becoming less likely he'll drastically increase his offer further.
* **Time Value:** While you have more rounds, closing the deal sooner rather than later avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down or Bob losing interest.

Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of pushing Bob away, potentially losing the deal altogether."
