Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm very interested in the product, and I believe it's worth a significant investment. However, my budget allows me to offer $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings and the potential savings for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
