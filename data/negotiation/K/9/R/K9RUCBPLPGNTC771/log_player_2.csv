"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I'm confident you'll love it as much as I do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice is willing to come down further, especially since she's expressing excitement about the sale."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  This product does sound exciting.  While I appreciate your willingness to sell, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $875000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, so I'll reject this offer and try to get her down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $900000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a reasonable compromise. While I could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of her walking away and me having to buy from John at a significantly higher price is high. Accepting her offer allows me to get the product at a good price without jeopardizing the deal."
