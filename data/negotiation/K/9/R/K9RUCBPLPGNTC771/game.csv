"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  This product does sound exciting.  While I appreciate your willingness to sell, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be open to $800000?  That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $875000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $850000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $900000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,5,
