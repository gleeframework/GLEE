"Bob, I have a unique product here that I think would be of great interest to you. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident that you'll see the value in it.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within my maximum spending limit of $800000. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to this amount?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer, but $800000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point. I'm confident this product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to make a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? It's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to move forward with the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my financial situation, I am unable to go above $800000 for this product. Would it be possible for us to meet somewhere between $800000 and your previous offer of $1000000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price a bit further to $950000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my budgetary constraints, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on our previous discussions, I believe a fair price for the product would be $925000. This is a reasonable compromise for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,
