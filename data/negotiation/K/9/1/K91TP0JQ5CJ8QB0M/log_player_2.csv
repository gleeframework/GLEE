"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,000.  It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still save $1,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John. Your goal is to save as much money as possible, even if it means a slightly less desirable deal."
