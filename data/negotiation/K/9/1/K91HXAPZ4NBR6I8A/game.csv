"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that initial price is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more reasonable starting point. How about we bring it down significantly?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,600,000 represents the high end of the product's value,  $800,000 undervalues it significantly. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  I could potentially do $1,100,000 if that works for you?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  $1,100,000 is getting warmer, but to be fair to the value this product brings, I'd need something closer to $1,250,000.  This is a small adjustment that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle right in the middle at $1,175,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting very close. $1,175,000 is a tempting offer, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. To make this work, I'd need a final offer at $1,220,000.",1220000.0,Alice,7,
