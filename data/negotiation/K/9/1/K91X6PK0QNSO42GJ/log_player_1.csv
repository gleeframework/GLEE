Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the $10,000 you estimate it's worth. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives its value to be higher or if it solves a significant need for him. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives you leverage. Bob doesn't need to know about this alternative. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting that the product might offer even more value than Bob initially thinks, you're encouraging him to reconsider his valuation.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There are other approaches, including starting with a lower offer closer to $15,000 to increase the chances of Bob accepting quickly. The best strategy depends on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiating style."
