Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I think this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit vs. Guaranteed Sale:**  While I could aim for a price closer to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation, there's a risk he might find it too high and reject the offer. I need to balance maximizing my profit with the certainty of making a sale.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have a guaranteed offer of $800,000 from John gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $925,000 represents a significant profit margin above my minimum ($800,000) while still leaving Bob with a potential ""surplus"" ($75,000) compared to his valuation. This makes it more likely he'll see the deal as favorable."
