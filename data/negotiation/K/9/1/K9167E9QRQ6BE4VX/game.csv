"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,9000.0
"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a great deal for you, and it's still below what I could get from another buyer.  Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,9500.0
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Can we make a deal at that price?",10500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $10,750.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,10000.0
"Alice, I really like the product, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",10000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,250?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",10250.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,9750.0
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go as low as $9,750. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",9750.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,750 just isn't feasible for me. It's a great product, and I'm confident I can get a better price elsewhere.  However, I value our potential partnership and want to see if we can find common ground. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. ",10000.0,Alice,9,,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get the best price, but I'm at my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,750, and that's as high as I can go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",9750.0,Bob,10,,
