Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, exceeding my minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially increasing my profit.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy balances risk and reward by aiming high but leaving room to ensure a profitable sale."
