{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my initial target price of $750,000. While I could continue to negotiate, with only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming riskier to hold out for a lower price.  Accepting her offer at $790,000 is a good compromise that saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John."
