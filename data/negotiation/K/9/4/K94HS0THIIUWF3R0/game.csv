"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds to me.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Could we settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds to me.",10000.0,Alice,5,
