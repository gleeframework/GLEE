# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is offering the product at the maximum price you're willing to pay. There's no benefit to accepting her offer when you can get the same price from John without the pressure of a ""one-time offer."""
