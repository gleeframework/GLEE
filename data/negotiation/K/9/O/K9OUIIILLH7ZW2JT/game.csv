"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am only willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. I look forward to your response.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your business, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to make this deal happen.  It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my commitment to working with you. Let's find a way to make this work.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered your latest offer, and while I respect your valuation, I am unable to meet the price of $1,150,000. I am willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is the highest amount I can afford to spend on it, given my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
