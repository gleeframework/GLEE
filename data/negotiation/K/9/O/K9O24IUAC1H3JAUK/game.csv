"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product and your suggestion, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a lower budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose a price of $100 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise between our previous offers.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a fair price.  $100 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get $105 for it. This would be a good price for both of us, as I'm sure you'll agree it's a great product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle at $105.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we could reach an agreement closer to $97. I hope this proposal will be acceptable, as it is still above your initial offer and below my original proposal.",97.0,Bob,6,
