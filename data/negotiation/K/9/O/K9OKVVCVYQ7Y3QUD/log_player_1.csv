Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer aims to maximize profit while still being somewhat flexible. Here's the reasoning:

* **$150 is a good starting point:** It's above your minimum value of $120, giving you a potential profit. 
* **Open to negotiation:** This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to counter-offer.  
* **Positive and enthusiastic message:** This makes Bob feel valued and might increase the chances of him accepting.

However, it's important to consider:

* **Bob's potential value:** If you have any information about Bob's potential interest or willingness to pay, you can adjust the offer accordingly. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** A higher price might mean a higher profit, but also a higher chance of rejection. You need to weigh these factors depending on your risk tolerance."
