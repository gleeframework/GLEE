"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique item that I believe could greatly enhance your daily life. Considering its quality and features, I suggest we start our negotiation at $120. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to propose a different price.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product's features, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in buying, but I can only offer $75 at this time. Let me know if that works for you.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Therefore, I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable for you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $90 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget.  Let's try $85.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. What do you say?",85.0,Bob,4,
