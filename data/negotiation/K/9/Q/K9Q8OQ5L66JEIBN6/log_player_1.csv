Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $1,500,000?**  I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. This gives me room to potentially negotiate with Bob if he's interested. 
* **The Risk:**  Bob might reject the offer, leaving me with John's offer of $1,200,000. However, there's also the chance Bob is willing to pay more, allowing me to maximize my profit.
* **Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a sale.  By starting high, I can see if Bob is truly interested in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
