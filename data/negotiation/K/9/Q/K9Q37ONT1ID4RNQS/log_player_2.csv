"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product at a price that's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. This is a chance to acquire a valuable asset for a fraction of its true value.  I understand this product is worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000.  This is a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
