# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $1750000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1500000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1400000. I think this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob is willing to negotiate, it seems we're at an impasse. I'm not comfortable going lower than $1,500,000, and I'm not confident Bob will budge significantly higher.  John is a sure bet, and it's better to secure a deal with him than risk losing both opportunities."
