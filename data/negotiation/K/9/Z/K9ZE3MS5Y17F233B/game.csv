"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $1750000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1600000.  This still gives me some wiggle room, but it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1350000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1350000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm committed to reaching a deal. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $1500000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also allowing me to meet my own needs.  What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1500000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1400000. I think this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
