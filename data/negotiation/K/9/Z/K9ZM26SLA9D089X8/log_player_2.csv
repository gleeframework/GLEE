Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit far from $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way down to $110. But I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $125. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $125, and it's better to secure the product at John's price of $120 than risk further negotiation."
