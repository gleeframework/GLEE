"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000), but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message sets the tone for a potentially successful negotiation.
* **Flexibility:** By leaving room for negotiation, I'm acknowledging the possibility that Bob might counteroffer,  keeping the deal open.

**Important Note:**  This is just the first offer.  I'll be evaluating Bob's response and adjust my strategy for the subsequent rounds, including potentially moving to John if the negotiation doesn't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $10000 for it. Let me know if this is something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Counteroffer Opportunity:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range. This is a strategic move to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **John's Guarantee:**  While John offers a guaranteed $12,000, I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. 

**Next Round:**

I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable range, aiming for a compromise with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for the product. This still reflects the high quality and value it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a compromise by lowering my price from $11,500 to $11,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Margin:** $11,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to sway him towards accepting my offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm keeping the negotiation moving while still holding firm on my desired price range.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll re-evaluate my options for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my research and the value I believe I can get from this product, I would like to propose a price of $9500. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling Price:** Bob's offer continues to drop below my minimum acceptable price. This suggests a significant gap in our valuations and further negotiation might not be fruitful. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will keep lowering the price, and I could end up with a deal that's not financially viable.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on a potentially better deal.

**Decision:**

The risk of further negotiation with Bob is too high. Selling to John ensures a profitable transaction and eliminates further negotiation rounds."
