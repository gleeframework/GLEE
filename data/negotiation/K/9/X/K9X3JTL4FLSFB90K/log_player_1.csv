"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. My initial offer is $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not immediately dropping to my minimum price, allowing for negotiation and potentially a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he is willing to negotiate, indicating that there's potential to reach a higher price in the next round.
* **Selling to John is a Guarantee:**  Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm willing to risk further negotiation with Bob in hopes of a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $100 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to go down to $120.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product, subtly reminding Bob that it's worth more than $100.
* **Open-Ended:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, in case Bob wants to counter-offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. This still allows you to cover your costs while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $110 is only $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'd be stuck with the $150 offer from John. 
* **Time is Limited:** With only 6 rounds remaining, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a good price within a reasonable timeframe."
