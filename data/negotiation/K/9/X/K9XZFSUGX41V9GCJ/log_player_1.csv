Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""potential"" and ""return on investment,"" you subtly imply the product is worth even more than your asking price, justifying the high number. 
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in your offer can make Bob more likely to consider it seriously.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, you may need to adjust your price."
