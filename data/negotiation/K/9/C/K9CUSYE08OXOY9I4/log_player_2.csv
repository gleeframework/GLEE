Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original price to make this deal work.  How about $850,000? This is a significant discount from my starting point, and it still allows you to realize the value you see in this product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
