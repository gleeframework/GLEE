"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know you're interested in. I'm starting at a price of $900,000, reflecting its value and potential.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is beyond my budget. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $750,000. This price is fair and reflects the potential I see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original price to make this deal work.  How about $850,000? This is a significant discount from my starting point, and it still allows you to realize the value you see in this product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value I see in this product.  Let's finalize this deal at this price and move forward.",800000.0,Bob,4,
