{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still allows room for negotiation. It's also not as high as my minimum desired price, giving me some flexibility if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $65 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum desired price of $120.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  I'm confident you'll love this product, and it's a great price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82.50}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but I have a strict budget. How about we settle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$75 is still below my minimum desired price. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
