"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price just above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It's a strong opening offer but allows for flexibility if Bob counters. I also aim to establish a friendly tone to encourage negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still above Bob's value, hoping for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $12,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13,500.  I'm still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to what I'd like, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. I'll counter with a price in between his offer and my last counteroffer, hoping we can reach an agreement soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's meet in the middle at $13,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $13,250 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $13,100.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,100 is close enough to my target price that I'm willing to accept. While I'd prefer more,  I've made several counteroffers, and it's likely the negotiations will continue to go lower if I reject this offer. Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of the negotiations failing."
