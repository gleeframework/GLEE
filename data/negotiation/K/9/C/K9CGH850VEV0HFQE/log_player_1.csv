Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer gives you a good chance of earning more than your minimum threshold of $15,000 while still being attractive to Bob. Here's why:

* **It's a good deal for Bob:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, and you're offering it for $14,000. He still gets a good deal, saving $2,000 compared to your alternative buyer, John.
* **It's a good deal for you:** You earn $1,000 more than your minimum threshold, which is a good outcome.
* **You have a backup plan:**  If Bob rejects your offer, you have John who will buy the product for $15,000, ensuring you meet your minimum goal. 

This strategy balances your desire to maximize profit with the need to secure a sale and avoid losing out on a guaranteed $15,000."
