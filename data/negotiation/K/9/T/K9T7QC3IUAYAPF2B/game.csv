"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $11,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $12,500. This offer reflects a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $11,500. Would that work for you?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $11,500 is still below my target, I'm willing to accept $12,250 as my final offer. This is a small concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,5,
