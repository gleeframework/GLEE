"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  This would still leave you a decent profit, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
