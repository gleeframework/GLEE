Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, leaving room for potential bargaining. By stating the value to Bob, it subtly suggests a win-win situation for both parties. It also keeps the option open to sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
