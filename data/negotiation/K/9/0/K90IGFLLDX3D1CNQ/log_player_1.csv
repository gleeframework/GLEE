Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more. 
* **Positive Messaging:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product. This might make Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate and potentially lower the price slightly, but I'll always keep my minimum value of $80 in mind. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
