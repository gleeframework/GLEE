Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This offer is a starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still leaves me with a healthy profit.  I believe it's likely to be enticing enough for Bob to consider, but also leaves room for negotiation if he feels the price is too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept it. I'll counter with a price that's more in line with my expectations and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000.  This is still a significant profit for me, and hopefully, Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $900,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price that it's worth accepting. It's better than risking a prolonged negotiation and potentially losing out on a sale."
