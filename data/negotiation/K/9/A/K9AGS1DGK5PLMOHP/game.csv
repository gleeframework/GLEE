"Bob, I have a very special product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a unique opportunity, and I'm confident this product will significantly benefit your business. Let me know what you think!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1200000.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000 to make this deal work.  This is a significant investment for you, but it's also a chance to acquire a product that could really drive your business forward. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1350000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1275000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get closer to a deal.  What do you think?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. $1275000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be, but I'm willing to compromise one last time.  I'll come down to $1300000.  This is a final offer. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I believe this price is a good value for the potential it holds.  Let me know your decision.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
