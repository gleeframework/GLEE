"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, making the price more appealing. 
* **Open Ended:**  The message ends with a question, encouraging Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a better deal. Selling to John right now would guarantee $15,000, but I believe there's still potential to reach a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm standing my ground while demonstrating flexibility by reducing my price. This shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating but not desperate.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I reiterate the product's value and frame the price as a win-win for both of us. 
* **Call to Action:** I encourage Bob to respond and potentially close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I believe there is room to negotiate further. I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiations.  My goal is to reach a price closer to $12,000 or potentially even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to compromise.  I'll offer you the product for $11,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this offer."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing Bob I'm willing to move closer to his price, but I'm not giving in completely.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that the price is still fair and reflects the product's worth.
* **Urgency:** I subtly suggest that this might be my final offer, encouraging Bob to act."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000, accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a rejection by Bob."
