"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am proposing a purchase price of $1,000,000. This allows me to acquire the product without straining my finances too much.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves room for a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
