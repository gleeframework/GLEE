Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so $10,000 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You value the product at $12,000, so you still have room to negotiate upwards if Bob counters.
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:**  You're not starting at your ideal price, which makes you appear more flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial $8,000 valuation, it's still below my minimum of $12,000. I can likely get closer to my desired price by counter-offering.  

I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob without risking losing him entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great price for the product considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9,500 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,200 is still below my desired price, it's closer to my minimum of $12,000 than my previous counteroffer.  I've already rejected Bob's offer once, and further negotiation could risk losing him entirely. 

It's important to balance maximizing profit with the risk of losing a potential sale. In this case, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice."
