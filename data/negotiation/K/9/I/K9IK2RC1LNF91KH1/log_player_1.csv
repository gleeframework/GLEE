Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  There's room for negotiation, making it more likely Bob will accept.
* **It shows confidence:** You're not giving away the product for cheap, but you're also open to a deal. 

I'll be ready to analyze Bob's response and strategize your next move!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a bit steep for me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, we can likely do better. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to your minimum:**  This shows Bob is willing to negotiate.  
* **You have leverage:**  You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to push for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

We'll send Bob a counteroffer that's closer to the midpoint, but still favorable to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $92.50? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:**  This offer is exactly halfway between your previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85.  
* **Fair but Firm:**  You're not giving in completely, but you're showing flexibility.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value Bob will get and avoids being overly aggressive.

This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while still pushing for a price closer to your desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $90 even? That's a decent compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your goal:** $90 is very close to your previous counteroffer of $92.50, and significantly better than selling to John for $80.
* **No guarantee of improvement:** There's a risk of pushing Bob further away, and he might walk away from the deal entirely. 
* **Good compromise:**  $90 is a fair middle ground, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly higher price.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice, ensuring a good profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
