**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's not worth accepting this offer.  You have room to negotiate a lower price, and buying from John is always an option if you can't reach a deal with Alice."

{""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, showing Alice I'm getting closer to her desired price.  However, it's still within my budget and leaves some room for negotiation if needed.  We're getting close to a deal, and I want to see if this offer will be accepted."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my desired price. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I believe I can secure a better price. Although buying from John is always an option, I'm confident I can get a better deal with Alice if I continue to negotiate."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in the 9th round, and the offer from Alice is still $1,500,000, exceeding my budget of $1,000,000.  There is only one round left, and I don't believe we'll be able to reach a mutually acceptable price in that time. 

To avoid potentially losing the opportunity to purchase the product altogether, it's best to accept John's offer and secure the product at my desired price."
