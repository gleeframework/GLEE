Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential.

Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a million, it's clear he's very hesitant to go much higher. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which at this point is a safer bet than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially getting even less."
