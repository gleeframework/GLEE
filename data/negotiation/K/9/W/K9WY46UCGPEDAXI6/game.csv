"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for the product.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which I believe is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $13,000 is a compromise, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I really need to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $12,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $11,800. Can you meet me there?",11800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're making an effort to come up on price, and I appreciate that.  However, $11,800 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $12,500, which I believe is a fair compromise given the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not comfortable with $12,500. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,900. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",11900.0,Bob,8,
