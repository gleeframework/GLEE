Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to spend up to $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, I know the product's worth. I'll aim for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is already a very competitive price for this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This offer stands as a testament to my eagerness to work with you."", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still unable to meet the price of $10,500. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $9,500 if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $9,500 offer. Accepting would mean a significant loss compared to John's offer. It's time to move on to ensure the best possible outcome."
