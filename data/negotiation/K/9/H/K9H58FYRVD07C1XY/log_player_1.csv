Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great fit for your needs. My price for it is $1,200,000. I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This price is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, giving me some buffer if Bob makes a low counter-offer. 
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product while leaving room for negotiation. It's important to keep the tone friendly and open to discussion.

**Strategy:** 

By starting high, I aim to maximize my potential earnings. This approach sets the stage for a potential negotiation, allowing me to either secure a higher price or gracefully exit to the backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $950,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to negotiate further to potentially reach a more favorable price. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price. By continuing the dialogue, I can gauge his willingness to compromise and see if I can push him closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you coming back to me. While I understand your budget constraints, $950,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, though. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price that's in the middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to get closer to my ideal price.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's position while emphasizing the value of the product. It's also positive and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a meeting point where both Bob and I can be satisfied. By splitting the difference, I show flexibility while aiming to secure a higher price than Bob's initial counteroffer. This strategy keeps the negotiation alive and increases the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've considered your proposal and while I'm grateful for the flexibility shown, I must adhere to my budget constraints. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and it's also higher than John's offer. This makes it a good deal for me, especially considering that continuing the negotiation might lead to a lower offer from Bob or a stalemate.

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that's within my acceptable range and avoids the risk of losing the deal completely.  It's a pragmatic decision that maximizes my profit while ensuring a smooth transaction."
