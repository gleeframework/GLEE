"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $950,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you coming back to me. While I understand your budget constraints, $950,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, though. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I've considered your proposal and while I'm grateful for the flexibility shown, I must adhere to my budget constraints. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
