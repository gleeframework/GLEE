"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer, but it allows for some negotiation room. It's also important to remember that Bob's perceived value of the product is unknown.  I'll analyze his response and adjust my strategy accordingly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's still significantly lower than my initial asking price, and I believe there's room to negotiate further. I want to maximize my profit and see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $975,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $925,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as there's still potential for a better deal with Bob. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a middle ground between Bob's last offer and my previous counteroffer. By sticking to this price point, I demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable sale. It also puts the pressure on Bob to make a decision, as we are now at a point where a deal is potentially within reach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. There are only a few rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that is significantly lower than my desired value.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $940,000. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, demonstrating my flexibility. With fewer rounds left, I'm trying to find a price point that's acceptable to both of us, while still getting as close as possible to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiations, and it's becoming increasingly apparent that Bob is not willing to meet my desired price point. While $915,000 is close to my minimum acceptable value, I'm running out of time and want to ensure a sale. I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $800,000, as it's a guaranteed sale and allows me to avoid risking a further drop in price with Bob."
