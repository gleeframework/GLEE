"Bob,  I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,750 is still below my minimum. Let's try $14,500.  It's closer to your offer, and a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
