"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? I'm really interested in the product but that's my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 was a bit steep for you, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95.  If you're not able to accept that, I might have to go with John's offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about $110?",110.0,Alice,5,
