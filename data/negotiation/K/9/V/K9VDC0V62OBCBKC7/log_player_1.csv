Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14000} 

I'm starting with a price close to my minimum value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant amount for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm above Bob's offer. This allows me to see if he's willing to come up a little more."
