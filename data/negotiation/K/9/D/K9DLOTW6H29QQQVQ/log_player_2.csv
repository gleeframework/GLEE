"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $11000.

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I can offer the product to you for $10500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob has reached his limit. He has already made a counteroffer that was rejected and Alice has stated this is her final offer.  The price is still above his target and he has already used up 6 rounds. Rather than continue a potentially fruitless negotiation, he should buy the product from John at the guaranteed price of $8,000."
