"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $8,000.  It makes no sense to accept it at this point. Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $8,000, this is the most aggressive counteroffer you can make. It's unlikely Alice will accept this right away, but it establishes your price point and forces her to come down from her initial high offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is closer to your budget, it's still outside of your comfort zone.  There's still room for negotiation, and you should continue to try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've established a price range with your previous counteroffer.  This offer is a compromise, showing Alice you're willing to pay more than your initial $8,000 offer but still well below her previous price. It increases the chances of Alice accepting, while still keeping a significant amount of savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down on her price, but $14,000 is still more than you're comfortable paying. You have a few rounds left, and there's still potential to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and might encourage Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've been steadily increasing your offer while Alice has been steadily decreasing hers. This counteroffer continues that pattern and shows you're serious about buying the product, but still want to keep the price under $14,000. It's a good compromise that has a high chance of being accepted by Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is close to your ideal price, you're still within your budget and have a few rounds left to negotiate. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice and might encourage her to make a final concession. You want to see if you can squeeze out a bit more savings before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly getting closer to your target price. This counteroffer shows a willingness to meet her halfway, but still maintains a good margin for you. You only have two rounds left, so you're pushing to finalize the deal but still maximizing your savings.  This is likely the final offer you will make before accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiations.  While $13,250 is still a significant amount over your ideal price, it's a fair compromise and represents a significant savings compared to Alice's initial offer. It's better than the $13,000 you offered in the previous round and also better than buying from John for $8,000.  This is a good opportunity to secure the product and avoid the risk of losing it to another buyer."
