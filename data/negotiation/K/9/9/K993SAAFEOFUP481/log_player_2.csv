"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product! We're excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable asset. After careful consideration, we're willing to part with it for a price of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($1,000,000 vs $1,200,000).
* You have a strong negotiating position since you can always buy from John for $1,200,000.
*  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a great starting point, but I'm looking to invest in a product with a higher return. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in this product and is a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, we're not willing to go as high as $1,100,000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value we believe the product holds, but we're willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still below the product's worth to her ($1,200,000) and is a good deal for you. 
* However, since you have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John, it's worth continuing to negotiate. You can potentially get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my potential purchase from John. Let's work together to reach a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We're still not willing to go as high as $1,075,000. However, we're willing to make one more compromise. We're willing to offer $1,062,500. This is the highest price we're willing to consider, and we believe it's still a fair deal considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $1,062,500 is getting closer to your desired price range, and it's a significant improvement over previous offers.
*  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, but there's no guarantee. 
* You have only 5 rounds left, and buying from John will cost you more than Alice's offer. 
* It's a good compromise, and accepting the offer minimizes risk and potential losses."
