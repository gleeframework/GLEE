# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this item which I believe is worth at least $150. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm offering it to you at $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200.

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what you know John would sell it for.  You should reject the offer and see if Alice will come down in price."
