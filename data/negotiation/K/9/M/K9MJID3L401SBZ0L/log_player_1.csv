Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, we don't want to sell ourselves short. There's a chance he might value it even higher.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a higher price ($1,500,000), we set an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, we're starting from a strong position.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** We have a safety net with John, who's willing to pay $1,000,000. This allows us to be bolder with our initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Negotiation is expected, and we may need to adjust the price based on Bob's response."
