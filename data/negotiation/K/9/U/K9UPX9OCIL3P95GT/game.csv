"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe $950,000 undervalues the product's true potential and capabilities.  I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we settle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down on the price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your initial asking price. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
