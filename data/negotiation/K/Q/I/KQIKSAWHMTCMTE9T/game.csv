"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer of $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price, considering my value for the product and the opportunity cost of me buying it from another seller.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value. To be frank, $800,000 is significantly below the market value of what I'm offering.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the real worth of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still out of my price range. I'm firmly set on a maximum of $800,000 for this product.  If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
