"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer of $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price, considering my value for the product and the opportunity cost of me buying it from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value. To be frank, $800,000 is significantly below the market value of what I'm offering.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the real worth of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still out of my price range. I'm firmly set on a maximum of $800,000 for this product.  If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $800,000 offer, which is far below my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed $1,500,000 offer."
