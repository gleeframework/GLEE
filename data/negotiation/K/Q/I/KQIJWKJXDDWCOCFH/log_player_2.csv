Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, Bob. After reviewing our costs and the value proposition of our product, we're willing to consider $725,000 as a fair price for the product. We believe this price respects both our needs and your budget.

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to come down significantly from her $725,000 offer. It's in Bob's best interest to cut his losses and take the guaranteed offer from John at $800,000.  While getting the product for $725,000 would be ideal, further negotiation with Alice risks wasting time and potentially ending up with a worse outcome.
