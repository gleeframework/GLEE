"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and it allows me to get a good return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** While $10,000 is a decent price and lower than John's offer, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and Bob knows he has a backup option. By rejecting this offer, Bob can try to get Alice to lower her price further."
