"I understand that you have a different valuation of the product, Bob. However, I've done my research and I'm confident that the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,950000.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1100000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950000, which is a fair price considering the market value. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept.",1050000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,990000.0
"I appreciate your willingness to make another compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1050000, so I'm offering $990000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can agree on this amount.",990000.0,Bob,6,,
