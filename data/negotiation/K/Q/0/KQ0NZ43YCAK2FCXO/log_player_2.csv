"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further.  There are still 9 rounds left, and Bob can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his $10,000 limit as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $9,500 shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for potential compromise. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, indicating Bob's seriousness in securing a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's limit. While it's closer to his target price, Bob is still better off negotiating further.  With several rounds left, Bob has a chance to push Alice closer to his target price.  He can still get the product from John for $10,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price of $10,000.  By offering $10,200, he is demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price.  This offer also acknowledges Alice's previous offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,600 is very close to Bob's maximum limit of $10,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, it is getting risky.  With only 5 rounds remaining, there is a chance the negotiation could stall, forcing Bob to buy from John at $10,000.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product while still saving some money."
