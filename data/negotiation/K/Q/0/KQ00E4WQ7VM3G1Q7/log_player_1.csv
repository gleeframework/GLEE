{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation while still leaving you a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident I can get a higher offer.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $950,000? That's a fair price that considers the value of the product for both of us.  Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $925,000 is a good compromise. It's close enough to my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation might just lead to a stalemate. Selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, but it's risky to assume he'll still be interested if I decline Bob's offer.  It's better to secure a deal with Bob now."
