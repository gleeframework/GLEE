"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's closer to our maximum budget than her lowest acceptable price. We can definitely negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I find the price a bit high. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value significantly exceeds your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but calling it her final offer so early in the negotiation is a bluff. We're still far from our budget limit and her claimed value. Let's continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I need the numbers to work for me too. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Calling the bluff:**  By offering her stated value, we call Alice's bluff about it being her final offer. This puts the pressure back on her.
* **Strong position:** Offering her value is a strong position. It's unlikely she'll find another buyer willing to pay more, especially with the risk of further negotiation. 
* **Time pressure:**  While we have rounds left, moving towards a close sooner rather than later is advantageous."
