Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential and my budget.  Let me know what you think.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product significantly exceeds that amount.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a very competitive offer considering its potential. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This represents a fair value based on my budget and the product's potential. Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely we'll bridge the gap quickly enough to warrant passing up John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000."
