"Alice, while I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential and my budget.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This represents a fair value based on my budget and the product's potential. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
