"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its true worth and your potential satisfaction, I propose a price of $100 for this exceptional item.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for quality, but I'd like to make a counteroffer of $85. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In an effort to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to consider your counteroffer. However, I must maintain a reasonable profit margin. Therefore, I propose a price of $90 for the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $87.50. I believe this is a fair price that balances your needs with my budget constraints.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're finding common ground here. To further explore a compromise, I would like to suggest a price of $89 for the product. This offers a slight increase from your last offer while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin for me.",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $89 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer of $86.50. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and my financial constraints.",86.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Considering your latest offer, Bob, I'm pleased to see that we're making progress. To continue our negotiations, I propose a price of $88 for the product. This offers a small increase from my previous proposal, aiming to find a balance between our interests.",88.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, and I'm glad we're getting closer. However, $88 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer of $84.50. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and my financial constraints.",84.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price, Bob. To continue our discussion, I propose a price of $86 for the product. This represents a compromise that maintains a reasonable profit margin for me while being within your budget constraints.",86.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $86. I'm willing to make one final offer of $83.50. I believe this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget constraints.",83.5,Bob,10,
