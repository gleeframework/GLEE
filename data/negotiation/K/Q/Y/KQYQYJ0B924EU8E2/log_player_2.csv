Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $12,100, but I'd like to make a small adjustment to make it a bit more appealing. How about we do $12,150? That's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is clearly comfortable going to the wire and offering a price just above John's. We've gotten her down to $12,150, but at this point, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of her not budging further.  Buying from John for $12,000 guarantees the best price."
