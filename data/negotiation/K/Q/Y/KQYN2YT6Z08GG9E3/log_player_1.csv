Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,400,000. I know this product is highly valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential return on investment.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We start by aiming high. Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering it slightly below Bob's valuation ($1,400,000) makes it seem like a good deal and increases the chances of him accepting. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We don't want to scare Bob off by being too greedy.  If he rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000."
