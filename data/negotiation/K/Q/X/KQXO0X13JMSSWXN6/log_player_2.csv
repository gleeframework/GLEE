"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's a discount from your maximum, it's likely you can get a better price with negotiation. 
* **There's no rush to buy.** You have 10 rounds and can always buy from John as a backup.

This strategy aims to get the lowest possible price and leaves room for counter-offers."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price, aiming to quickly push for a lower price.
* **Reasoning:** The message emphasizes saving money while still being open to negotiation.  
* **Not too low:** The offer is still above Alice's worth, making it plausible for her to accept. 

This approach aims to maximize your savings in the early rounds while leaving room for negotiation."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to save a bit more, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to offer $875,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:**  This counteroffer is a smaller step than the previous round, showing you're serious about closing the deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $890,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value it holds for me. I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your target.** The offer of $890,000 is much closer to your desired price point.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! While $890,000 is tempting, I'd like to see if we can finalize this at $880,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures a smooth and quick transaction.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but Significant Counter:** This counteroffer is a modest decrease from Alice's last offer, showing you're committed to reaching a deal but still looking to save. 
* **Emphasis on Finality:** The message focuses on closing the deal quickly and fairly, putting pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Strategic Approach:** This offer leaves a bit of wiggle room for further negotiation if needed, but it's a strong move towards a final agreement.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get as close as possible, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $885,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's final offer is very close to your target.**  The difference is only $5,000, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get you much lower.
* **Limited time left.**  You only have 3 rounds remaining.  
* **Risk of buying from John.**  While you can still buy from John, it's more expensive. 

By accepting, you secure the product at a price that's very close to your ideal goal, minimizing your risk of not getting the product and having to buy from John."
