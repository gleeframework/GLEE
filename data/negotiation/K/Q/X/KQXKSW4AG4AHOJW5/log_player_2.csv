"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth more than $12,000 to you. To start, I propose a price of $15,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is above my maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to save as much money as possible. I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within the range I'm willing to pay. This initial counteroffer allows for negotiation and potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a middle ground. I am willing to consider a price of $14,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my maximum budget.  I'm going to continue to negotiate to see if we can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This price is closer to my budget, and I'm confident it's fair given the value you've outlined."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise.  $12,500 is a good midpoint between my initial offer and Alice's latest offer, and still within my budget. This should encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
