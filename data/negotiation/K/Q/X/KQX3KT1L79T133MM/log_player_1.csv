Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up. Let me know your decision soon!"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay a premium. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $18,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also establishes the product's value as potentially higher than his perceived $12,000.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning another offer, you create urgency for Bob to decide quickly and potentially avoid losing out. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiation style and your risk tolerance, you might adjust the initial offer."
