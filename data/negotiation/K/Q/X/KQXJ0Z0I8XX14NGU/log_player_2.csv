"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product, which I believe holds tremendous value for your company.  My initial price is $1,400,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement within the next few rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** Alice's offer suggests she's willing to come down from her initial price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You can always buy from John if you can't reach an agreement with Alice.

By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. To start, I'd like to offer $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious intent to negotiate. It's also still above Alice's minimum desired price, giving her room to negotiate.
* **Focus on finding common ground:** The message emphasizes a collaborative approach, aiming to build rapport and signal a willingness to compromise. 
* **Provides a starting point:** This counteroffer establishes a clear starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly.  My counteroffer is $1,300,000.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  $1,300,000 is lower than your maximum price of $1,500,000.
* **It's a good deal for you.** You've successfully negotiated a significant discount from Alice's initial price.
* **There's a risk of going further.**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or becoming less willing to negotiate in future rounds.

Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and minimizes the risk of further negotiations."
