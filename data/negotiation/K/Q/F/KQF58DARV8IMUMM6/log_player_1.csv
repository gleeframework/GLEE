{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and encourage engagement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I really like the product, but I have a budget constraint and I'm trying to be as frugal as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, but I'm hoping to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me the chance to push for a higher price.  If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your persistence.  $13,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $14,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is only $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of him backing out entirely.  Since I'm willing to sell to John for $15,000, accepting this offer is a good compromise."
