"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value to you, I believe it's only fair to present it at a price that reflects its true worth. Considering its exceptional quality and benefits, I propose a starting price of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good starting point, it's still significantly above what the product is worth to Alice ($8,000).  Bob has room to negotiate and save more money.  It's wise to reject the first offer and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, given its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to find a mutually beneficial solution. Based on our previous discussions, I am prepared to consider a price of $11,500 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you, and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $11,500 is still higher than Bob's ideal price point. It's worth trying to push for a lower price since Bob has plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to lower the price to $11,000 for the product. This price reflects its value while remaining within your budget. I believe this could be a satisfactory compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has continued to negotiate and come down in price, $11,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price point. Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and he still has multiple rounds left. It's worth continuing to press for a lower price and seeing if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still a bit above my target. I'm happy to meet you at $10,750.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be ready to purchase the product."", ""product_price"": 10750}
