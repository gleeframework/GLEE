(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is within my budget and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential for a few thousand dollars in savings.  It's time to close the deal."
