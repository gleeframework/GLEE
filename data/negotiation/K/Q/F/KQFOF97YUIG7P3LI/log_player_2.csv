"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80).  You can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $95? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by demonstrating you're interested in the product but willing to push for a better price. $95 is still above Alice's value for the product, leaving room for potential compromise, and is a reasonable starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $95.  How about we meet in the middle at $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $102 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what you're comfortable paying. You've shown willingness to negotiate and have a few rounds left, so it's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but $102 is still a bit too high for me. How about $98? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small move from your previous offer, demonstrating your commitment to a deal while still keeping the price below your target. It's also a reasonable middle ground between your last offer and Alice's current offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
