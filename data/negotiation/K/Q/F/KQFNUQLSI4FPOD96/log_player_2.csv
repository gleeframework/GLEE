"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to save as much money as possible. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Alice, I'm not sure if $13,500 is the lowest price I can get it for. I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better deal from her or find it cheaper elsewhere.
