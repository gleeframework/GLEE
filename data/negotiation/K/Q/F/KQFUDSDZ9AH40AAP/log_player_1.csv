"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me at $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and my initial asking price.  While I want to find a deal, accepting such a low price would be a significant loss.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I'm on a tight budget.  $13,000 is the highest I can go. If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is clearly very interested but also working within constraints. His latest offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I don't want to risk him walking away.
