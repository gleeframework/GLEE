"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose an offer of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've put into this product.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to meet you halfway. This price reflects the quality and value you'll be getting.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is still a bit below what I can accept. How about we split the difference and agree on $11,250?  This price is fair and allows both of us to get a good deal.  What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
