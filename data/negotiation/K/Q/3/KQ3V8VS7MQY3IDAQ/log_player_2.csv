"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. That's a significant discount from what it's worth to you, and it gives you a great opportunity to make a profit. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is quite high. While she claims it's a discount, you know you can potentially get a better price by rejecting her offer. You'll see if she's willing to come down further, otherwise, you'll buy from John."
