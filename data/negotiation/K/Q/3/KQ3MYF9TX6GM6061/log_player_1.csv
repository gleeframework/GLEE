"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation but still gives me a good starting point.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message builds rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates I'm open to discussing the price, which could lead to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and has shown willingness to negotiate.  There's a chance I can push for a higher price than $90.
* **Gaining Information:** Rejecting the offer gives me valuable information about Bob's negotiation style and his upper limit.
* **Selling to John is a Backstop:**  Selling to John is a good fallback option, but I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm happy to come down a bit, but $95 is my lowest price.  I think it's still a fair deal considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial offer, but I'm not giving away too much.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product provides to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive tone keeps the negotiation amicable and encourages a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Opportunity for Higher Price:**  While I could sell to John for $80, there's still a chance I can get a slightly higher price from Bob. It's worth at least one more round of negotiation to see if I can push him to $90.
* **Information Gathering:**  Rejecting the offer will give me more insight into Bob's negotiation strategy and his maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is the lowest I can go.  It's still a great price for the value you'll get from this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm meeting Bob halfway from his last offer of $85 to my previous offer of $95. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize that my price is fair.
* **Direct Question:** The direct question encourages a response and pushes Bob towards a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I really like the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is just $7.50 below my ideal price, but it's significantly higher than what John is offering.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.
* **Secure a Deal:** Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and a profit above my minimum acceptable price. There's a chance I might not be able to secure a better price in the remaining rounds."
