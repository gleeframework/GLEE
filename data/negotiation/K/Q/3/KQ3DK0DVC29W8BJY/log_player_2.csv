"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $1,000,000. Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject the initial offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $950,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to make a decent profit. Let's work together to make this happen.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price higher than what you're willing to pay. While $950,000 is a significant drop from her initial offer, you can likely negotiate further and reach a price closer to your ideal range.  Rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially save more money."
