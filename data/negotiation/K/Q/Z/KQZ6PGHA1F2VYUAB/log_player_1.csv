"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a clear starting point and expresses confidence in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10800 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my ideal. There are still 8 rounds left to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's true value. How about $11,200? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your investment."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $10900 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,900 is getting closer to my minimum, I am still hoping to get a higher price.  I have 6 rounds remaining and want to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your willingness to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $10,900 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $11,100. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product's value worth this investment."", ""product_price"": 11100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $10800 again. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached round 6, and Bob's offer remains at $10,800, which is below my minimum acceptable price. I've already spent several rounds trying to negotiate, and it doesn't seem like Bob is willing to go much higher.  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay $12,000. It's more beneficial for me to sell to John and secure the higher price."
