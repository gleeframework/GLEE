"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that this offer reflects the significant returns you'll see from this purchase.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify paying more than $800,000 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price considering my intended use of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly, especially considering its potential for generating value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,700,000? This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. I believe this price is fair, considering my intended use and the potential returns. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the gap between $1,000,000 and my minimum price is still quite significant. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but only if it reflects the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle again â€“ how about $1,450,000? This is a very competitive price for what you're getting.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,450,000 is still beyond my limit. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is a considerable increase from my previous offer. I'm genuinely interested in this product and believe this price reflects its value considering my intended use. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
