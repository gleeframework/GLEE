Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above my minimum price. 
* **Confidence:**  The message implies the product's value, which might make Bob more amenable to a higher price.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept $15,000.  A more aggressive offer might backfire and cause Bob to lose interest."
