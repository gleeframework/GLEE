"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, as it's worth that much to you.  I know you're a serious buyer and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for the same price, there's no incentive to accept the offer. Bob can get the product for the same price from John.  Rejecting the offer keeps the option of potentially getting a better deal open."
