"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's room for counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about making a deal but also setting a strong starting point for negotiation.  $750,000 is still a substantial amount, demonstrating your interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and still a fair value considering the product's worth. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget.  You can likely negotiate further, and it's always worth exploring more options before resorting to John's offer.  You have 7 rounds remaining, so there's time to find a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  This is my final offer.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

This counteroffer is your maximum budget, so it's a firm offer.  The message clearly states that this is your final offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept. The reasoning behind the offer is provided, making it more persuasive.  You have 6 rounds left, but it's important to signal a willingness to close the deal."
