"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, hoping to maximize my profits. I'm also framing it as a ""fair"" price to build a positive rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is lower than what I'd like, it's still within a reasonable range. I'm not going to settle for that price yet, as I believe there's room for negotiation. I want to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price without having to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and still a fair value considering the product's worth. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm countering with a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. I'm reiterating the value of the product to him and highlighting the significant price reduction from my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, hopefully encouraging Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  This is my final offer.  Let me know your decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly what the product is worth to me. There's no point in negotiating further, as any counteroffers could lead to a stalemate. Accepting his offer guarantees me my minimum desired profit, and it's better than risking losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
