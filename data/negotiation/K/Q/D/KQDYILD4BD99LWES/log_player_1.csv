"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, so I cannot accept it. I will counter with a new offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be a more attractive offer to him, while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell the product for less than $1,200,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price with this counteroffer of $1,250,000. It's a significant compromise, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price than my minimum. With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to be careful about not rejecting too many offers and running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are running out of time. While Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I don't have enough rounds left to risk another rejection and counteroffer.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and it's the safer option with limited time remaining."
