Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $100? That's still a great deal for you, and it leaves some room for us both to be happy with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 100}

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $85 is not a bad price, I'm still hoping to get a little more.  I'm not sure if I can get more from Bob, but I'm not going to give up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $95 is my absolute lowest. This gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still looking for a better deal, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I want to make sure I sell the product. $92.5 is a good price, and it's very likely Bob won't come up any higher."
