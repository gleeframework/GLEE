"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1200000. It's a steal considering its true value. I'm confident you'll find it incredibly beneficial for your business. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,200,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for less.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice has come down to Bob's maximum budget.  It's a good deal for both of them.  Bob shouldn't risk losing the deal by trying to negotiate further."
