"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your operations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly higher than what I'm able to pay. Given the value this product holds for me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still staying within my budget. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is quite a distance from what I had in mind. Considering the true value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing me to make the purchase. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring a strong return on your investment. Are you open to reconsidering?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for $950,000, but I'm still constrained by my budget.  I'm willing to go to $925,000.  This is a fair price that allows me to make the purchase while also considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. ",925000.0,Bob,6,
