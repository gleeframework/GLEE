"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice's minimum:** We know Alice values the product at $800,000. She won't go below that.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay up to $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's a significant gap between Alice's minimum and Bob's maximum. This means there's room for negotiation to get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer to Alice. A smart counteroffer would be somewhere below $925,000, but still above Alice's likely minimum."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $925,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $875,000 for it, reflecting its potential but also recognizing the need for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer logic:** This counteroffer sits strategically between Alice's likely minimum and Bob's desired price. It offers a significant discount from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's seriousness in negotiating while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Message tone:** The message is respectful and positive, emphasizing the shared goal of finding a mutually beneficial price.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  The offer is designed to make Alice feel like she's getting a good deal without sacrificing too much of Bob's potential savings.  It leaves room for Alice to counter with a price between $875,000 and her minimum of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  While I'm confident in the product's value at my initial price, I'm open to finding a middle ground. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.
* **Potential savings:**  By rejecting, Bob keeps the possibility of getting a lower price. 
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer is higher,  Bob can still potentially get a better deal with Alice, making John a safety net if negotiations fail.

**Next Steps:**

Bob should counteroffer again, staying within the negotiation range between Alice's likely minimum and his maximum.  A counteroffer around $885,000 could be a good strategy, showing continued progress while leaving room for a final agreement."

* **Potential savings:** Accepting this offer saves Bob $108,000 compared to buying from John.
