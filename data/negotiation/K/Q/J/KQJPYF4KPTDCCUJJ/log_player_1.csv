"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant amount more than my minimum value ($8,000), but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this is a fair offer that gives Bob a decent deal while also allowing me to earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I am not yet willing to accept it. I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I want to explore that space before settling for $8,500.  I'm confident I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's last offer. It's still a good price for me, and hopefully, it will convince Bob to close the deal without needing further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good deal for me. It's significantly higher than my minimum value and closer to my desired price point. I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
