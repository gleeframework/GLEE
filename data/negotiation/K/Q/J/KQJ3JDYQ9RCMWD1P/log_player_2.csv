# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. It's a great price, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. It's a great compromise, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?

While Alice is coming down, the price is still closer to John's offer than my ideal price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more to see if I can get it lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. It's a fair price, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is a good compromise, saving $1500 compared to John's offer."
