Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm going to start by offering Bob a price slightly above the value he places on the product ($1,500,000). This gives me some room for negotiation and allows for a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a price of $1,600,000. This is still a significant profit for me and closer to my ideal price. It also shows Bob that I am willing to negotiate but have a firm price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk getting a lower offer or spending too much time on this negotiation. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and move on."
