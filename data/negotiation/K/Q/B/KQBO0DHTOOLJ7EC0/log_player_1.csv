"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $10,000. I want to maximize my profit while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to $9,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair compromise given Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping to reach an agreement within the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $8,900. This is a small concession, but I believe it's enough to entice Bob into accepting. If he rejects, I'll likely sell to John in the next round to avoid losing more time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,800 is just above my minimum acceptable price.  With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing more time and possibly getting a lower offer. Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit, and it's the best outcome I can reasonably expect at this point."
