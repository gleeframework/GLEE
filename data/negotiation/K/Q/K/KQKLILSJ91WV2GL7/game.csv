"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't meet the price of $14,500. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $12,000 is below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This feels like a fair compromise.",13250.0,Alice,3,
