{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value, making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a better price.  You can counteroffer and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $87.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'd really like to get this product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $87.5 is very close to your minimum price of $80.  It's a good deal for you and keeps the negotiation moving forward.  There's always a risk that Bob might reject your next counteroffer, and you could end up selling to John for $80.  So, it's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
