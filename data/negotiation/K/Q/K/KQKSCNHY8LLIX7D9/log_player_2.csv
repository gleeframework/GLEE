Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle! However, I'm still not quite ready to let go of the product at $88. How about we take it up to $90? It's a small increase, but it's still a great deal for you, and I think it's worth it for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $90 is a reasonable price, saving $30 from John's offer."
