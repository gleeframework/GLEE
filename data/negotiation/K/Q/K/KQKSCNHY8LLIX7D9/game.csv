"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $85 is a good price, but I'm still looking to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $92? It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",92.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle! However, I'm still not quite ready to let go of the product at $88. How about we take it up to $90? It's a small increase, but it's still a great deal for you, and I think it's worth it for the product's value.",90.0,Alice,5,
