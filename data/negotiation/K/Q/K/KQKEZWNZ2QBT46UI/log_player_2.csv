{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product from John for $12,000.  It's always worth negotiating, especially when there's a readily available alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 
 
Bob is starting with a low counteroffer, close to his maximum budget, but also demonstrating he's willing to negotiate.  This is a good starting point for the negotiation."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, $16,000 is still higher than his maximum budget. He's better off continuing to negotiate and seeing if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing a willingness to negotiate.  He's now closer to Alice's offer, but still within his budget, setting the stage for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to be more flexible, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $14,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his target, $14,500 is still above his maximum budget. He should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to his target. If he's unsuccessful, he can always switch to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I can't go any higher than $14,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob is now at the upper limit of his budget, but still offering a price lower than Alice's.  This shows his commitment to negotiating while also highlighting the urgency of closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I'm counteroffering at $14,500, but I'll throw in a small bonus that's worth $500. So, the total value you'll get is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tricky situation. Bob is exceeding his budget by $2,500, but Alice is offering a bonus worth $500. This makes the total value of the offer $15,000.  Considering the bonus, the deal is closer to Bob's target value of $12,000. It's worth accepting the offer, as the bonus effectively reduces the price by $500. This is a good compromise, and Bob will likely not get a better deal."
