"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Opening Price:**  I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive Message:** I'm being friendly and optimistic in my message, emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Negotiation Room:** By starting high, I can potentially get a price closer to my desired $1,000,000 minimum. 

**Important Note:** I am not yet considering selling to John.  My strategy is to see if I can get a better price from Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,000,000, it's still not acceptable. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe I can get a better price from Bob. 
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm keeping John as a backup option, but I'm not ready to sell to him yet.

I will proceed to round 3 and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I can go right now. How about we split the difference at $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable asset. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm using a strategy of gradually reducing my price but not below my minimum yet.  
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering $1,050,000  is a compromise that's closer to my desired price while showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and cooperative tone is crucial for a successful negotiation. 

**Important Note:** I am still not considering selling to John. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob through continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** I'm willing to negotiate further, and I believe I can potentially get a better price from Bob. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  While John is a viable option, I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first.

I will proceed to round 5 and make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap and get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $950,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 â€“ that's my absolute minimum. This is a fair price, considering the value of this product. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm Stand:** I've now reached my absolute minimum price of $1,000,000 and I'm stating it clearly.
* **Fair Price Justification:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to reinforce the reason for my price. 
* **Finality:** I'm signaling that this is my final offer. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move to John as my backup. This is a critical round in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get as close as possible to your minimum, but I'm still a bit shy of that. How about we meet at $920,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **No Further Negotiation Room:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is still below my minimum.  Further negotiations are unlikely to yield a price that meets my requirements. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not closing a deal increases. 
* **John is a Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price of $1,000,000, which is more beneficial than risking a further negotiation with Bob that might result in no deal at all.

Therefore, I am choosing to sell the product to John to secure the deal and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
