"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You still have 9 rounds to reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you outlining the product's value.  However,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,275,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account both our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,275,000, which is within your budget of $1,500,000 and closer to your ideal price. Accepting this offer saves you $25,000 compared to buying from John.  While there's still room for negotiation, it's likely Alice won't go lower."
