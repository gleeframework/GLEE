Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you outlining the product's value.  However,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000.

I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account both our positions."", ""product_price"": 1275000}"
