"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. I'm aiming to maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  This price is above what the product is worth to Bob, but it's a starting point to see how much he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject this offer and counter with a lower price in the next round. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, showing some flexibility while still aiming for a price that is closer to my desired amount.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I believe we can continue to negotiate and reach a deal closer to my desired price.  I'm confident that I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and a few more rounds could get me closer to $1 million.  I'll reject this offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm making one final attempt to close the deal with Bob.  I'm getting closer to his last offer, but still aiming for a price that's more profitable for me. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept my offer.  If not, I'll move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $990,000 is a good offer, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk getting a lower price in the final rounds. John's offer of $1,000,000 is the best I can get at this point, and I'm confident that it's a good deal for me. I'll accept John's offer and move on to selling the product to him."
