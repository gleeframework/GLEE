**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll reach a point significantly below $1,000,000.  John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, which is already a good deal compared to Alice's starting price.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk that she won't go low enough, and we'd end up having to buy from John at $1,000,000 anyway."
