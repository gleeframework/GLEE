{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** $1,400,000 is still above Bob's valuation of $1,000,000, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This offer is lower than your minimum of $1,500,000, leaving room for counteroffers and potential profits.
* **It's a strong starting point:** A clear offer gives Bob a starting point and sets the tone for the negotiation. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. While I need to be strategic, I can't risk settling for such a low price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum and see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too far below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
This counteroffer is a strategic move:

* **It's closer to Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **It's still above my minimum:**  $1,200,000 is above my minimum of $1,500,000, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **It's a clear message:** A specific price demonstrates my seriousness and sets a clear expectation. 

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I need to stay within my budget.  How about $950,000? That's a significant move on my part and shows I'm serious about making this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still too far below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to counter with a price closer to $1,200,000.  I'm hoping to meet in the middle and secure a better price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to both get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is calculated to:

* **Show progress:**  $1,100,000 is a significant compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating my desire to reach an agreement.
* **Maintain a strong position:**  It's still above Bob's offer, showing that I haven't lost sight of the product's value.
* **Encourage a final decision:** This price point suggests that I'm open to a quick resolution, hoping to close the deal without further rounds of negotiation."
