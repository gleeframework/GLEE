"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $950,000 is less than $1,000,000.
* **You can save money:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though Alice's offer is close to your maximum, it's still a better deal than your alternative."
