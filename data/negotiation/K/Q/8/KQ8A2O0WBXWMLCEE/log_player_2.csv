Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $115, but I'm still not comfortable selling it for that low. I can offer it to you for $122. It's a compromise, but I think it's fair considering the product's value.

It's time to cut our losses.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $120, and we have a guaranteed option at that price with John."
