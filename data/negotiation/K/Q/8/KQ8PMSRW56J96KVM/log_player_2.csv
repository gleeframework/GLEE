"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $8,000 to you, accepting Alice's offer wouldn't save you any money. You can get the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to explore other options or potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice in the future."
