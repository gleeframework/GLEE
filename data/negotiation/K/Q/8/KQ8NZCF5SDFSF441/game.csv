"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still below the value I'm looking for. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $950,000. This allows for both of us to find common ground and move forward.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Can you consider that?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I value your continued interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $950,000.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $940,000. This reflects both our positions and provides a fair compromise.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $940,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but I need to be careful with my finances. Can you consider this offer?",920000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $920,000 still falls short of my expectations. To show my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to drop my price to $930,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.  What do you think?",930000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $930,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $930,000, which would be $925,000. Can you consider this offer?",925000.0,Bob,8,
