"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value. This is a tactic to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his estimated value. It also sets the stage for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm not yet ready to accept. I believe I can negotiate a higher price and still secure a deal with Bob. I'll use this opportunity to test his limits and see if he's willing to go further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer to $1,500,000, which is my absolute minimum. This shows I'm serious about selling to Bob but also highlights my willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's still a good deal for him considering his estimated value of $800,000."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept it. It's below my minimum acceptable value, and I believe I can secure a better price through further negotiation. It's important to remember that I have the option of selling to John for a higher price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation.  I'll continue to try and find a deal that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer again, but this time to $1,350,000. This is a compromise to show Bob that I'm willing to meet him halfway. I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for him to consider, as it's still significantly higher than his initial offer.  I'm also aware that if Bob rejects this offer, I have the option to sell to John for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is below my minimum acceptable value.  While I've shown a willingness to compromise, I'm now getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  Considering John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable value, it's more beneficial for me to sell to John and avoid further negotiations. This decision guarantees me a sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
