"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price, but it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't lose out on my minimum profit.  I'm also trying to build a friendly rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept since it's close, I'm going to reject it and try to push for a better price.  I have 8 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but still staying above my minimum. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product for Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $15,200 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum threshold of $15,000 and it's a good deal for me. Even though I could sell it to John for $15,000, this deal is slightly better, and I don't want to risk losing out on this opportunity with Bob."
