"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $90 at this time. ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and uniqueness.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's try $105.  This would allow us both to make a fair deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'll meet you at $108, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product.",108.0,Alice,5,
