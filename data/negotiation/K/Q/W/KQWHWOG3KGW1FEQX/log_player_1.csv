I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Although it's tempting to take the $975,000, I'm still only a few rounds away from potentially getting closer to my target price, or at least hitting my minimum. I'm going to see if I can squeeze out a bit more before resorting to selling to John."

While I am getting closer to my minimum, I believe there is still room to negotiate. I will reject Bob's offer and make one more counteroffer in hopes of securing a better price. If the next round doesn't yield a better offer, I will sell to John."
