"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is too high. While it's lower than the value to you, it leaves a significant margin for Alice. It's worth negotiating further to see if a better price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $900,000 is a bit steep for me at this stage. To show my seriousness, I'm willing to offer $750,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us, and allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer presents a lower price point, pushing Alice closer to her value of $800,000 while still keeping room for potential negotiation in future rounds. It also highlights the intent to be a serious buyer while not immediately accepting the initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your seriousness in negotiating the price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $825,000 is still higher than her true value of $800,000, indicating there's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting this offer keeps the opportunity to potentially secure a better deal while leaving the option to buy from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which reflects a fair compromise and allows for both of us to gain from this deal. Let's finalize this transaction and avoid further delays."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer directly targets Alice's minimum acceptable value,  demonstrating a willingness to meet her halfway while still benefiting from a lower price. The message emphasizes finalizing the transaction to encourage Alice to accept and avoid further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, taking into account the value you've placed on the product. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is still above her minimum value of $800,000, it's closer to your target price. Accepting this offer avoids further negotiation rounds and ensures a purchase for a reasonable price. It's also important to consider that there are only 5 rounds remaining, and buying from John for $1,500,000 is a less attractive option."
