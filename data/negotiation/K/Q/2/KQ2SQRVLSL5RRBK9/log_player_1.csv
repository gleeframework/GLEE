"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious offer, especially when you know your product's worth to you ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Setting the Anchor:** This initial offer acts as an anchor, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value and his counteroffer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your valuation and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is tempting, there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and potentially reaching a price closer to his $800,000 valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential benefits for you."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a substantial concession from our initial offer to show Bob we're willing to negotiate. This can encourage him to do the same.
* **Staying Above Bob's Valuation:**  The $900,000 price is still comfortably above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, giving us room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** We're emphasizing the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits it offers.

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I can do $700,000. That's a significant investment on my part and reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** We are still significantly below John's offer and believe there's room to push Bob closer to his $800,000 valuation.

We'll continue the negotiation in the hopes of securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that reflects the true value of this product. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $850,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** We know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, giving us a strong fallback position.
* **Compromise and Finality:** We're splitting the difference between his offer ($700,000) and our previous price ($900,000). Presenting it as our ""final offer"" adds weight and encourages Bob to make a decision.
* **Above Bob's Valuation:** While it's a significant concession, the price remains above Bob's perceived value, potentially leading to a favorable outcome. 

By introducing a sense of urgency and demonstrating our willingness to compromise, we aim to push Bob towards a final decision in this round."
