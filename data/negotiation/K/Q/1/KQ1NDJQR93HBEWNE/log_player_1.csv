"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $20,000. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value of the product to Alice and shows a willingness to work with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. Can you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is at Alice's minimum, it's still worth trying to get a better price.  Alice has 9 more rounds to negotiate, and there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more than $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $17,500? This gives you a good deal while allowing me to recover some of my investment."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure if $17500 is the best price for me. Can you consider a lower price, perhaps around $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still holding out for a better price. While $15,000 is her minimum, she still has 6 rounds left to negotiate. She might be able to convince Bob to come up a little, especially since he's already expressed interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference - I'll go down to $16,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 16250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $16250 is still a bit too high for me. Can you consider going down to $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is below Alice's minimum. While she has 4 rounds left to negotiate, it's becoming increasingly likely that Bob won't budge from his price.  Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay her minimum, it's strategically better to sell to John now and avoid risking further negotiation."
