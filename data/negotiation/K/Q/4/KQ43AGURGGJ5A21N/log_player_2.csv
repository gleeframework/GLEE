You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can do better. You're willing to pay $15,000, and she's motivated to sell for at least $12,000. By rejecting this offer, you signal that her initial price is too high and open the door for further negotiation."
