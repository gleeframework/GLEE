"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $1,150,000 for the product.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,150,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we settle at $1,900,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a substantial discount.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
