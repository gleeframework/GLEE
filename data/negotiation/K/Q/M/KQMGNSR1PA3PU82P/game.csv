"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your interest in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise from my initial offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still quite interested, but $900,000 is a bit beyond what I had in mind. How about we settle in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $800,000, so I'll offer it to you for $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
