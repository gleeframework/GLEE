Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I believe it's worth even more to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a great price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good offer, I still believe I can get closer to the $1,200,000 value Bob places on the product.  I have 8 rounds left, so I can afford to reject his offer and see if I can push for a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. With 6 rounds left, I can afford to keep negotiating and see if Bob will come up to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate that. However, $1,075,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but only to $1,100,000. This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I have 4 rounds left and I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.  I'm willing to take the risk of rejecting his offer and see if I can push him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $1,087,500 is still not a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,093,750. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1093750}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now in round 8, with only 2 rounds left. Bob has repeatedly rejected my counteroffers, and his final offer of $1,075,000 is still below my minimum desired price.  Although I could make another counteroffer, the risk of further rejection is high, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than what I can get from John.  Therefore, it's best to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John and move on."
