Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you're interested in, for $11,500. I think it's a fair price that reflects the value it offers."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  Offering a price too close to $12,000 might discourage Bob. This offer strikes a balance between profit and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Backup Option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, ensuring she doesn't lose money if Bob declines."
