"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This price is fair, considering the value to both of us, and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to you and aiming for a compromise, I propose we set the product price at $11,500. This price reflects a reasonable increase from my initial offer while staying within your budget constraints.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. This price would still be a good deal for you, considering your initial offer. Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Bob,4,
