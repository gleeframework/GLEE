Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message vaguely mentions ""incredible value"" to pique Bob's interest without revealing specifics that he could use to counter-offer. 
* **Urgency:**  By stating ""limited-time offer"" and mentioning ""other interested parties,"" you create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** This strategy assumes Bob highly values the product and might be willing to pay a premium. 
* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a negotiation strategy in mind, but don't go below your minimum of $1,200,000."
