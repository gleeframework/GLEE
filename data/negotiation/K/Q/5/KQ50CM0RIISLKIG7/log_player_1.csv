"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language to create a good impression and establish a foundation for a successful negotiation.
* **Reasonable justification:** I'm providing a reason for my price,  ""reflects the product's worth,"" which makes it seem more legitimate.
* **Open-ended question:** Ending with a question invites Bob to engage and provides an opportunity to understand his perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1100000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I want to reach a deal, I'm not willing to compromise that much.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price, closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a bit too far below my asking price.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's value and potential, while allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's perspective:**  I start by acknowledging Bob's point of view to show respect and build rapport.
* **Suggest a middle ground:** I propose a price of $1,050,000, which is a compromise but still significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price than Bob's offer.
* **Reiterate product value:** I reiterate the product's value to reinforce the justification for my price.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I emphasize the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement to encourage Bob to cooperate. 
* **Open-ended question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1050000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  To make this work, I'm willing to offer $1000000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget. I believe it's a good deal for both of us, and it could help us finalize the deal quickly. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is now at my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I recognize that this is a fair deal considering the value of the product to Bob and the potential for further negotiations. Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
