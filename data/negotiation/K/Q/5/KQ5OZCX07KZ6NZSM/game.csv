"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $850,000 for the product. Is this something you'd be interested in?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm keen on the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to offer $700,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $775,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $775,000 is getting closer, but it's still a little steep for my budget.  How about $740,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",740000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",750000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're right, we are getting close!  I could meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $745,000?",745000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $750,000 again, but I'd like to add a small premium to account for the effort we've put into this negotiation. How about $760,000? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",760000.0,Alice,7,
