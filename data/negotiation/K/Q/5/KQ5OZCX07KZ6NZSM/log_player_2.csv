Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $750,000 again, but I'd like to add a small premium to account for the effort we've put into this negotiation. How about $760,000? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $760,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly trying to push the price higher. At this point, accepting her offer of $760,000 would mean losing out on the guaranteed $800,000 price from John.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a better result than John's offer."
