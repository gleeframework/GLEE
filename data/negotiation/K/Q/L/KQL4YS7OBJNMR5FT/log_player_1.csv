{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great asset for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product. This will encourage negotiation while still giving you room to maneuver and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $8,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more to make this deal work. How about $9,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I can only offer $8,800 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $8,800 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000, it's not worth risking further negotiations. I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
