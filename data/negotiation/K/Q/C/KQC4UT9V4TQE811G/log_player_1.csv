"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point that gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price.  I'll adjust based on his response in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is still a decent profit for me, and it's a more reasonable starting point for negotiation than my initial $200 offer.  I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. I'll counter in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm countering with $155.  This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and allows for a little wiggle room.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob's offer of $145 is close, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems like we're at an impasse.  John's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price, and it guarantees a sale without further negotiation."
