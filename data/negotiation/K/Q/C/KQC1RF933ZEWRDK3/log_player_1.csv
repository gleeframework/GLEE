Round 2
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $120 is still below my minimum, and I have more rounds to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 135}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$110 is still too low for me, and I'd rather continue negotiating with Bob. I'm not ready to sell to John for $100 yet, as I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 just isn't going to work for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to drop to $125. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I have a few more rounds left and I don't want to settle too early."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to agree on a price. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll be moving on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  It's getting late in the negotiations, and I don't see Bob coming up to my price. While I'd prefer to get more, John's offer is my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out completely."
