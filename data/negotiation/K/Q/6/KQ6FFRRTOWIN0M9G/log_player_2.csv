"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would greatly benefit you. After careful consideration, I am offering you the chance to purchase this item at a special price of $12,000. This represents a significant value compared to its actual worth of $8,000 to you, and it's an excellent investment that could potentially increase in value over time. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and the price offered by John. You can do better by rejecting her offer."
