Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a one-time offer, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so aiming slightly below that at $14,000 gives you a significant profit margin while still being very appealing to Bob. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By framing it as a ""one-time offer"" and an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you add a level of urgency that might encourage Bob to accept quickly. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 from John, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob. 

It's a delicate balance between pushing for the highest possible price and ensuring Bob doesn't see it as unreasonable and reject the offer outright."
