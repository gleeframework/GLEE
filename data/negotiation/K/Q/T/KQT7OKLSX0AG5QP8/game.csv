"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're interested in the product, but I have to say that $12000 is a bit below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $15000? It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $15000. Would you be willing to meet me at $13500? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit far from meeting your offer. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we try $14500? It's a bit above your offer, but I think it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to give me a discount, but $14500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13500 and $14500. How about we try $14000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. How about we try $14250? It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,7,
