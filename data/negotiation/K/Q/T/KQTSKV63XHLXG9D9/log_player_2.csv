"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for something worth at least $150 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than Alice's initial valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $125?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $132.50?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $120 limit.  While Alice's counteroffer is closer, it's still above his budget.  Continuing to negotiate allows Bob to potentially get a better price, or, if unsuccessful, to buy from John at his preferred price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $132.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $130?  This would be a good middle ground, and we could finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
