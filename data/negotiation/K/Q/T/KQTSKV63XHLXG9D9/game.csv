"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for something worth at least $150 to me. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $125?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $132.50?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $132.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $130?  This would be a good middle ground, and we could finalize the deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
