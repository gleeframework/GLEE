# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to meet your exact budget of $950,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $975,000, which is a small step closer to your target price.

Alice has come down significantly and is only $25,000 away from my budget ceiling. It's unlikely she'll go lower, and this price is a good deal compared to John's offer."
