"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps around $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering your previous offers, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can do $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to further discussions if needed.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  To be completely transparent, my budget ceiling is $950,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to meet your exact budget of $950,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $975,000, which is a small step closer to your target price. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to finalize the deal at this point.",975000.0,Alice,7,
