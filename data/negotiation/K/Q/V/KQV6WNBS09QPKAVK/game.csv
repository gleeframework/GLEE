"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1000000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $800000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm trying to be flexible here.  $850000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you at $875000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",875000.0,Alice,5,
