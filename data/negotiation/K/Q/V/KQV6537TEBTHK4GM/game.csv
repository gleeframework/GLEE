"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to match this price if you decide to walk away.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $850000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $850000 might be a stretch, but I'm still very interested in finding a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your initial offer. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $750000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $650000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer.  Let's make a deal.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $650000 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not ready to let go of the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $700000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,5,
