"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to match this price if you decide to walk away. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. There's potential to negotiate further and save more money. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to meet you somewhere in the middle."
