Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000 right now. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,050,000? That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price, as it's significantly less than your original offer and still allows you to profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm holding out for a better deal. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $950,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,000,000? This price is fair to both of us, allowing you to acquire the product at its true value and me to secure a profitable sale. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
