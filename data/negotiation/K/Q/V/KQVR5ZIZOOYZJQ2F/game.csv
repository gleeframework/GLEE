"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,050,000? That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the outcome.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price, as it's significantly less than your original offer and still allows you to profit.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $950,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,000,000? This price is fair to both of us, allowing you to acquire the product at its true value and me to secure a profitable sale. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
