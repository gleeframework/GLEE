"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $90 for it. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a middle ground. How about we agree on $105 for the product? This price reflects its value while remaining within your budget. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial solution.",105.0,Alice,3,
