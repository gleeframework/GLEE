"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's close to my ideal outcome, but still leaves room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a bit less than that to get it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. $135 is a decent offer, but I think I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I think I can squeeze out a bit more in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}

I'm meeting Bob halfway with this counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows him my willingness to compromise while still securing a price that's more favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating for a higher price, I'm running out of time and Bob's offer is very close to my minimum. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and avoid potentially having to sell to John for less."
