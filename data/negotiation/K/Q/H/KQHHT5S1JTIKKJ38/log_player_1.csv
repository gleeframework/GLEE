{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $12,000, but I'm also aware that Bob is only willing to pay $8,000. I believe that $10,000 is a fair compromise that might be attractive to him. 

I'm ready to negotiate further if Bob rejects this offer. I'll be mindful of John's offer of $12,000 as my upper limit for the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob. I'll send him a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while keeping in mind his budget and John's offer as potential alternatives."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is a significant investment for me, and I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum price.  I'm open to discussing further if this doesn't work for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum of $12,000, Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer.  It's a significant improvement from his initial offer, and it's getting closer to my minimum. I'm also wary of going back and forth much longer, as I risk losing out to John.  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
