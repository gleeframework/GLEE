{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000, which might incentivize Bob to accept. However, it still leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price point. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $13,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price.  How about $13,000?  That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $500 below my minimum acceptable price of $13,500.  Considering I could sell to John for $15,000, this is a good deal.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
