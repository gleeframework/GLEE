"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm confident in the value of this product, I understand your perspective. I could come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects a more reasonable compromise and still ensures a worthwhile return for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $2,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm feeling comfortable at $1,800,000.  This price allows us both to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try to close the deal at this price.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting close.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,900,000? This would be a strong win for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're getting close, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $1,800,000. This price allows for a good profit for both of us, and it's the maximum I can afford. I hope we can reach an agreement at this point.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
