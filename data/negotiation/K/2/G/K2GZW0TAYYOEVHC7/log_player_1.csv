"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold opening that gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers. I'm confident the product is worth at least this much to me, so I'm not afraid to start high.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss.  I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still leaves a decent profit margin for me. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a reasonable compromise and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still too low for me to consider. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm not willing to settle for less.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000. This is a more reasonable offer than my previous counteroffer, but still leaves a comfortable profit margin for me.  I'm hoping Bob is getting closer to understanding the true value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to continue negotiating, hoping to get a little closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is a small concession, but it shows that I'm serious about making a deal. With only 3 rounds left, I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good opportunity to close the deal.  If he doesn't, I'm ready to sell to John and secure my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum acceptable price, but with only two rounds left, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with John in the future, so I'm going to sell the product to him now."
