"Bob, I believe this product is a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than $1 million in your hands. I'm willing to part with it for $1,000,000. This gives you a significant profit margin while ensuring I receive a fair price for its value.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This allows me to stay within my financial limits while still providing you with a fair return for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my desired price point. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $975,000 for the product. This offer allows both of us to find a compromise that works for both parties.",975000.0,Alice,3,
