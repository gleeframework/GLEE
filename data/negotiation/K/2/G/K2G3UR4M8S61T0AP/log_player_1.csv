Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This allows me to stay within my financial limits while still providing you with a fair return for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
