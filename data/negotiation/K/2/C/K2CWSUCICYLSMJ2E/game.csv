"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if it's something you're interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, so let me know if it's something you're interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
