You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it aims to establish a starting point for negotiation that is closer to my maximum budget. It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it will give me a clear understanding of how flexible she is on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget. It's not ideal, but buying from her is the same price as buying from John.  Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, accepting her offer makes sense as it closes the negotiation and avoids further rounds."
