"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $17000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $12000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $14000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $13000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
