"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but there's room for improvement. Since my goal is to save as much as possible, I'll counteroffer and see if I can get a better price.  There are still 9 rounds left, so I have plenty of time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to Alice's minimum value.  While it's a bold move, it demonstrates my seriousness in getting a good deal and leaves space for negotiation. I still have 8 rounds to work with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise.  It's a significant improvement from her initial offer and well within my budget. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal or having to buy from John for a much higher price is too high.  I'm happy to close the deal at this point."
