It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice. You can likely get the price down a bit more, and it's always good to try and save as much money as possible."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's still within the realm of reason for both of us.  It's a strong opening move that shows I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is now only $20,000 higher than my initial counteroffer. It's a good deal, and the potential savings from further negotiation might not be worth the risk of Alice walking away or the time spent in further negotiation."
