Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Targeting Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $120. Offering it at $115 leaves room for negotiation but ensures you capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product. 
* **Considering John:**  Having John as a backup buyer with a $100 offer provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't go well, you can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $100 matches John's offer, we know Bob values the product at $120. There's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price than $100. We'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget concerns, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle? I can let it go for $108."",
""product_price"": 108
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By suggesting a price of $108, we're showing a willingness to compromise and move closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Staying Above John's Offer:** This price point ensures we still make a profit above what John is offering.
* **Encouraging a Deal:**  Meeting in the middle is often seen as a fair negotiation tactic, which may encourage Bob to accept."
