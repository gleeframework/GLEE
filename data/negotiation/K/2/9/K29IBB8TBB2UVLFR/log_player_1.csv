Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $200 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a budget. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $200 represents my initial asking price, I understand your budget constraints.  Could you meet me halfway at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $140 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about $100? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob has reached his maximum valuation and is unlikely to go higher. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $150 from John."
