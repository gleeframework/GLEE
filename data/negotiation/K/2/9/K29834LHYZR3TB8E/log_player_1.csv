Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $10,000, giving you a baseline for negotiation. 
* **Aiming High:** Starting with an offer of $19,000 aims to maximize your potential profit. While it's significantly above Bob's valuation, it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so you're not desperate. This allows you to be firm in your negotiation with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy.  A lot depends on your negotiation style and your assessment of Bob's personality. You could choose to start lower, but this initial offer aims to get the most value from the sale."
