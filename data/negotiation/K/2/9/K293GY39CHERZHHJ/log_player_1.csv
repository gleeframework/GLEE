Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While your final offer is tempting, I'm afraid $1,100,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within my budget.

While getting $1,200,000 from John is tempting, accepting Bob's offer of $1,100,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now with Bob means receiving the money sooner. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
* **Negotiation Dynamics:** Bob has consistently increased his offer and stated his absolute limit. Pushing further risks losing the sale entirely.
* **Profitable Deal:** $1,100,000 is still a significant profit over the product's minimum value to me ($1,200,000)."
