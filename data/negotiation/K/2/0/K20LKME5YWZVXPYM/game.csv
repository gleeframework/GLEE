"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $900000. Could you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm thinking of a price between $1000000 and $1100000. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Could you consider $950000? It's a fair price considering the value I'll get from this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $950000, which would be $1000000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you've compromised significantly, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Could you consider $980000? It's a fair price considering the value I'll get from this product, and I'm willing to make a final offer.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not convinced that $980000 is a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to make one last compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1020000. It's a bit above your offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,7,
