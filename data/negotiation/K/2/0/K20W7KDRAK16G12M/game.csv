"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your portfolio. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,100,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,100,000 is quite a ways off from what I'm looking for.  Could you meet me at $1,450,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. This is the absolute highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value we both place on the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
