"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that considers the value of the product to both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your perspective. After considering the value this product brings, I believe a price closer to $1,350,000 is more reflective of its worth. This still offers you a significant gain while recognizing the unique nature of what I'm offering.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us both to be happy with the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This recognizes the value you see in the product while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still above what I can afford right now. I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let's split the difference and agree on $1,275,000. This would be a good compromise and allow us to close this deal.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
