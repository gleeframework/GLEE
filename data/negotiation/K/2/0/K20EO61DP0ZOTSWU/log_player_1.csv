"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  We start high to establish a strong bargaining position, closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** While the starting price is high, it allows space for negotiation and signals that we are aiming for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Professional tone:**  Maintaining a positive and professional tone encourages a constructive negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that considers the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant profit, we have room to negotiate. Bob's offer suggests he's very interested and willing to pay a substantial amount. Rejecting now keeps the negotiation open and allows us to counter with a price closer to our desired outcome. We're still far from needing to settle for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your perspective. After considering the value this product brings, I believe a price closer to $1,350,000 is more reflective of its worth. This still offers you a significant gain while recognizing the unique nature of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're coming down from our initial price, but not drastically. This shows flexibility while still aiming high. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message reinforces the product's value, justifying the higher price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The $1,350,000 counteroffer aims for a price point that's advantageous for us but potentially acceptable to Bob. We're moving towards a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us both to be happy with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, indicating he's willing to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is tempting, we're still in a strong position with plenty of rounds left.  We'll counter again, pushing slightly closer to his price while still aiming above $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This recognizes the value you see in the product while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's last offer ($1,250,000) and our previous one ($1,350,000), signaling a strong desire to close the deal.
* **Simplified Proposal:** By framing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" we simplify the negotiation and present it as a fair and straightforward solution. 
* **Maintaining Firmness:**  We're holding firm above $1,300,000, demonstrating we're not desperate to settle for less while still offering Bob an attractive price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still above what I can afford right now. I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let's split the difference and agree on $1,275,000. This would be a good compromise and allow us to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,275,000 is a significant profit margin, exceeding our minimum by $275,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has consistently increased his offer and is now very close to our desired price range. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to push for a higher price risks Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a very good deal and avoids the potential loss of selling to John."
