"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,500,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $500,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is my best compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for countering. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we try $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,100,000? I'm willing to give you a bit more wiggle room, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,100,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you consider $900,000? I believe that's a reasonable price that reflects both the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,050,000? I'm willing to give you a bit more room to negotiate, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
