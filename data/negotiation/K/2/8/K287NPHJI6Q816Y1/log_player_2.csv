"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $12000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely do better.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me right now. How about $10,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $10000 is a good starting point, but I'm still looking for a bit more. Let's split the difference and go with $11000.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price.**  While Bob might want to try for a lower price, the risk of getting stuck with John's $15,000 price is increasing. 
* **$11,000 is a significant savings compared to John's price.**  This is a good deal for Bob, considering his goal is to save money. 
* **The negotiation process is taking time.** The longer it drags on, the more likely it is that Bob will lose his chance to get a good deal from Alice and be forced to buy from John.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of a lengthy negotiation."
