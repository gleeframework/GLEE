"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. My initial offer for the product is $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I'm hoping to get a better price. I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a significant discount, but I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking that $1000000 is a bit too low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1350000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you've placed on the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $1150000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. My counteroffer is $1275000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
