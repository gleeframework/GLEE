"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it presents a unique value proposition and am confident it will be highly beneficial for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer ($9,500) is higher than your maximum budget ($8,000). 
* You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John. 

It makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
