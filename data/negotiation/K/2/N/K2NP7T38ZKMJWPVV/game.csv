"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Can you consider my counteroffer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Can you consider my counteroffer?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Can you consider my counteroffer?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $11,500. I can do $12,250. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower, Bob. I've already met you halfway and given you a good deal. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $12,250. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",12250.0,Alice,9,
