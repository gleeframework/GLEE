Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value is significant to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Given its unique nature and your immediate need for it, I believe this is a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to be ambitious with your initial offer to Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting at $1,500,000 allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness and potentially secure a significantly higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and ""exclusivity"" to justify the high price. This approach aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level.

**Important Note:**  This strategy involves some risk. There's a chance Bob could reject the offer outright. However, the potential reward of a 50% profit margin justifies the calculated risk, especially given your fallback option with John."
