{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's uniqueness and value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is a significant drop from my initial price, it's still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a safe option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $900,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Perspective:**  I'm showing respect for Bob's position by acknowledging his counteroffer. 
* **Firm but Fair:** I'm making a counteroffer that's a significant compromise from my initial price but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Finality:**  I'm clearly stating that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1200000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1050000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come up from his initial offer, his current offer of $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's unlikely that further negotiation will lead to a better price, and I'm comfortable selling to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000. It's time to move on and secure a reliable sale."
