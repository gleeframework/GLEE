"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $11,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still find this product worth it at that price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This feels like a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can get good use out of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $10,500 is a good price, and I'm confident I can make a profit on the sale. It's also better than selling to John for $8,000."
