Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my $15,000 minimum. I'm better off taking the guaranteed sale with John."
