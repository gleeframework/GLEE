# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject the offer and try to get her down to $1,275,000. This will keep the price within my budget and still allow Alice to make a reasonable profit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,275,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price. I've only got 5 rounds left, so I need to be careful not to risk losing out on a good deal. While $1,290,000 is still a little higher than I'd like, it's within my budget and a significant saving compared to buying from John.  I'll accept the offer."
