"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This signals Bob's intent to negotiate and helps establish a lower starting point for further discussions. He's offering a price closer to his ideal range, but still leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's a significant improvement from her initial offer.  Bob is trying to save as much as possible, but at this point, accepting the offer is the best option. 

* **Buying from John:**  This would be more expensive than Alice's offer.
* **Continuing to negotiate:**  While Bob might be able to get a slightly lower price, there's no guarantee. There's a risk that Alice will walk away or hold firm at $10,500. 

Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price without risking a breakdown in negotiations or having to pay a higher price to John."
