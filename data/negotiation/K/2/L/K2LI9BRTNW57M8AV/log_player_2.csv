"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $13,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save money and Alice's offer of $12,500 is above his desired price. He can try to negotiate a lower price and see if Alice will go down to his maximum budget of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is my maximum budget.  If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I might have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 12000}
