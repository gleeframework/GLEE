"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value.  Let's make a deal!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is my maximum budget.  If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I might have to look elsewhere.",12000.0,Bob,4,
