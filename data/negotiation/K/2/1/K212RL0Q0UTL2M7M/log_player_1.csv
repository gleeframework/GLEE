"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm a bit of a savvy shopper, and I'm looking to get the best deal possible. Can you meet me at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision at that point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $10,250 is still a good deal for me. It's better than selling to John for $10,000, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation."
