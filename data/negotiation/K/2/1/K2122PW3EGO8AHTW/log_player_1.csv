Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get closer to Bob's perceived value of $15,000, but I'm not giving away the whole profit margin in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not going to accept it. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $13,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
