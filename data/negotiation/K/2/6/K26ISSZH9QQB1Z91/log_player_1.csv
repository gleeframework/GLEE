{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $20,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value to Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, I'm only able to pay $15000 at this time.  Let me know if that works for you.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer. I'll counter Bob and see where we can land."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a little to $17,500. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17500 is still a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $16250? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is getting close to my minimum value, and it's clear that Bob is unlikely to go higher. I'll accept his offer, as $16,250 is a good price and a fair compromise."
