"Hi Bob, I understand your position. While $15000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a little to $17500. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17500 is still a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $16250? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",16250.0,Bob,4,
