Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to counter with a price of $1,050,000. This reflects the value I place on it and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
