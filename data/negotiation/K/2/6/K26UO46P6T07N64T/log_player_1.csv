"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I want to see if I can push for something closer to $1,000,000."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $850,000, I'm still holding out for a higher price.  Since Bob is willing to negotiate, I want to try and see if I can get closer to $900,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 6

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and while I'd prefer a higher price, $875,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly more than what I'd get from John, and we're only a few rounds away from potentially reaching a stalemate. It's time to close the deal."
