"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000.  He should try to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

Bob should offer his maximum budget of $8,000. This sets a clear boundary and shows Alice that he's serious about a deal, but it's also his best possible price.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this offer right away, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still outside of his comfortable range.  He should continue to negotiate, aiming to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob should offer $10,000. This is a significant increase from his previous offer, showing Alice he's willing to compromise. However, it's still within his budget and allows for potential negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is tempting and gets Bob closer to his goal, it's still outside his ideal price range.  He should continue to negotiate and aim for a lower price. There are still several rounds remaining, and a counteroffer could potentially land him a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob should counteroffer with $12,000. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product, but is still trying to get the best possible price. It's a reasonable middle ground, and with a few more rounds remaining, he has room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, he should still try to negotiate further.  He has only a few rounds left, but with Alice's offers getting progressively lower, he could still get a better deal.  There's no harm in pushing for a lower price, especially since he has the option to buy from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

Bob should offer $12,500. This is a slight increase from his previous offer, showing Alice his commitment to reaching a deal.  It's a strategic move to test the waters and gauge Alice's willingness to compromise.  Since this is only the eighth round, Bob still has time for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He has one round left, and the possibility of a counteroffer that might land him a better deal.  While $13,200 is tempting, he could potentially get a price closer to his ideal range with one more round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12800}
```

This is Bob's final chance. He should offer $12,800. It's a slight increase from his previous offer, demonstrating his willingness to close the deal. This offer is within his budget, and while it's not ideal, it's a reasonable compromise with only one round left. He's hoping Alice will accept, but if not, he'll be forced to buy from John."
