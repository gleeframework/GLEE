"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product brings you. Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for this product.  Let's split the difference and find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $950,000 is still a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That way, we both get a fair deal and we can close this transaction quickly.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
