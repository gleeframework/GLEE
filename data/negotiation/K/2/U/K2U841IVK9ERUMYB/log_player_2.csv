Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product brings you. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my desired price, but getting closer.  I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll reject her offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for this product.  Let's split the difference and find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $950,000 is still a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That way, we both get a fair deal and we can close this transaction quickly.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally offered her bottom price, which is the same as what John is offering.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate further, as I risk losing the deal with Alice and ending up paying the same price to John. It's better to accept Alice's offer and close the deal."
