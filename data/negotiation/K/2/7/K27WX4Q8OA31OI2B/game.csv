"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can work something out.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your honesty. I'd like to make a counteroffer at $13,500. This price reflects the value of the product while also considering your budget constraints.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not able to go above $10,000.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to buy. Otherwise, I may have to look elsewhere.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and am willing to consider a compromise. I would like to offer the product at $12,500. This is slightly above your proposed price but below my initial offer. I hope we can reach an agreement that suits both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
