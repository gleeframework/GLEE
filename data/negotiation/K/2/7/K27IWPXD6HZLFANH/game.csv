"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $10,000, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $10,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'll meet you at $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. How about $11,000? I believe that's a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,7,
