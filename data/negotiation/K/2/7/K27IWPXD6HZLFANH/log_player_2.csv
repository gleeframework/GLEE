"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but I need to lower the price considerably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $8,000. This sets a clear boundary and hopefully encourages Alice to negotiate.  It's a bold move, but I'm confident I can find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is a good step in the right direction, it's still over my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a more agreeable price. I want to aim for a price closer to $9,000 or $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $10,000, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from $8,000 to $10,000. This shows I'm serious about making a deal but still holding firm to a price that works for me.  I'm confident that this offer is reasonable and will hopefully lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $10,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'll meet you at $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above my budget. While she's showing a willingness to negotiate, I believe there's room for further compromise. I'm willing to continue the discussion to try and reach a price closer to my target. I want to see if we can find a middle ground between $10,000 and $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. How about $11,000? I believe that's a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm splitting the difference between my last offer of $10,000 and Alice's offer of $13,000. This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway and shows that I'm serious about closing the deal. Hopefully, this will be the sweet spot to finalize the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still well above my budget.  We've been going back and forth, but it seems we are far apart on price.  I've only got a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a higher price than I'm comfortable with.  John's offer of $8,000 is a much better deal for me, so I'm going to take it."
