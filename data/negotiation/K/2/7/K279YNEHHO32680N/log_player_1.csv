Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply it's worth the higher price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to discussing this further"" encourages Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, keeping the negotiation alive.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, it's not explicitly mentioned. This creates a subtle sense of scarcity without putting undue pressure on Bob.

This approach aims to maximize profit while maintaining a positive and open communication style with Bob."
