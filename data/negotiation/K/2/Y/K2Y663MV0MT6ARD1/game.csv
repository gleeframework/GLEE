"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $155?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you need to make a bit more, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make at least $145 to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $142.50?",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $142.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $135 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $140 to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $138?",138.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $138 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",130.0,Bob,8,
