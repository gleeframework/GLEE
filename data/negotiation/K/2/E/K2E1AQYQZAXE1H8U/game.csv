"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire a truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This offer reflects the product's true value while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
