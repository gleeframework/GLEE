Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation. This allows some room for negotiation while still showing confidence in the value of the product."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low. While I could accept it, it's significantly below my minimum value.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeping it well above Bob's initial offer and close to my minimum value.  This should keep the negotiation moving forward."

I'm dropping the price further, but still staying above my minimum value.  This shows flexibility while also indicating that I'm serious about making a deal with Bob.  This should be my final offer before considering selling to John."
