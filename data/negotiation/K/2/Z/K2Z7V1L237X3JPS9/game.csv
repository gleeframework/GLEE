"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we settle on $125? This would be a good deal for both of us, as you still get the product for less than you value it, and I get a price closer to what I'm looking for.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $120. How about we meet in the middle at $122.50? I think this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",122.5,Bob,4,
