"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know is worth at least $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for a price that's extremely fair, considering its value to you. I'm asking for $1,000,001. This is a chance to acquire something truly valuable at a very reasonable price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000 for the product, and Alice is asking for $1,000,001, it is more beneficial to reject her offer. You can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, saving yourself $1."
