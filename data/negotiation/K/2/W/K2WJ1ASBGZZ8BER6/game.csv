"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $11,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both parties.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
