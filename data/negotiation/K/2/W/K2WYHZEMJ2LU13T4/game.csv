"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial asking price. However, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be happy to pay $750000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $850000 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price point.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $750000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can come to an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package and a 6-month warranty, which will add significant value to the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $825000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
