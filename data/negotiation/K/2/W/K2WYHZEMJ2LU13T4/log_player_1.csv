Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $850000 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price point.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $750000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can come to an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.
