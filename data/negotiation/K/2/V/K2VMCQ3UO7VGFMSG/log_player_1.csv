Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Aiming high with $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This approach maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **Acknowledging Bob's Perspective:**  By mentioning ""fair reflection of its worth,"" you subtly acknowledge that Bob might have a different valuation in mind, opening the door for a counter-offer.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Expressing willingness to discuss pricing further encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process rather than immediately rejecting the offer. 
* **Backup Plan (John):** You have a strong backup plan with John, giving you leverage.  You don't need to be overly aggressive, as you're guaranteed your minimum price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or particularly price-sensitive, you might slightly adjust your starting price down.
* **Market Context:**  While not specified, external market factors (e.g., high demand for similar products) could influence your strategy."
