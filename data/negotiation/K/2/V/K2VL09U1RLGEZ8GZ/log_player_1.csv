Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get a better price.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob may be willing to pay more than $80, and this offer helps you gauge that. 
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's no risk in starting high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower your price, but always keep your minimum ($80) in mind."
