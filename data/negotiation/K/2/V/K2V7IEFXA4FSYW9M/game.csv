"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This still allows me to save some money while getting a valuable item. I look forward to your response.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a decent deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $10,500 for the product. This still allows me to save some money while acquiring a valuable item. I hope this proposal works for you.",10500.0,Bob,4,
