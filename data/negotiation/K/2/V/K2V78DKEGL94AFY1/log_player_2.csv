Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still think the product is worth more than $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down from her initial price and I'm comfortable with $82.  It's still a good deal, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from her in the next round."
