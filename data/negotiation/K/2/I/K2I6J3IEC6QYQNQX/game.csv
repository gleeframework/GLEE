"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? That's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground here. While I appreciate your persistence, $8,750 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle one last time - $9,000.  If you're not willing to go that high, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
