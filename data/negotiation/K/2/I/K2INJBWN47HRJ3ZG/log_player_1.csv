"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:**  By emphasizing the product's ""potential,"" I'm aiming to shift Bob's focus towards a higher perceived value, potentially exceeding his initial $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I want to signal that I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining a firm stance on the product's value. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I understand the value of the product but I can't go above $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident that through further negotiation, I can bridge the gap and reach a more favorable outcome. Selling to John is a last resort if negotiations fail to reach a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the product's value.  To be frank, $1,200,000 is quite a way off from what I had in mind. Let's meet closer in the middle.  How about we consider $1,900,000? This offer reflects a willingness to negotiate while still respecting the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** I want to maintain a positive and collaborative atmosphere by recognizing his counteroffer.
* **Firm but Fair:** While I'm significantly reducing my initial price, I'm still aiming high to provide room for further negotiation. The $1,900,000 counteroffer is a substantial drop but still keeps me well above my minimum.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its potential benefits and justifying a higher price point.
* **Encouraging a Middle Ground:** By suggesting a price ""closer to the middle,"" I'm encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my target range. 
 
This strategy keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price that reflects the product's true value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still outside of my range. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and aim for $1,550,000? This feels like a fair starting point to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and above what John is offering. While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more in further negotiations, there's a risk Bob could walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of continuing the negotiation."
