"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and ensures I'm not immediately selling at a loss compared to my minimum value.
* **Reasonable Justification:**  I'm providing a reason for the high price, emphasizing the product's value and potential. This might make Bob more open to negotiation. 
* **Open Ended:** I'm not making a hard demand but leaving the door open for discussion. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the first round. I'm strategically setting the stage for future negotiations, keeping in mind my minimum value and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value ($1,000,000).** Accepting it would be a significant loss for me.
* **There are still rounds left.** I have time to negotiate further and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is always an option.**  This gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value while remaining open to finding a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below what I need to consider. Given the product's potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** My counteroffer is significantly lower than my initial price but still above my minimum value. 
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I'm highlighting my willingness to negotiate and meet Bob halfway. 
* **Focus on value:**  I'm still reminding Bob about the product's worth, justifying my counteroffer.

**Strategy:**  By coming down slightly, I'm showing flexibility. However, I'm still holding firm to my minimum acceptable price. This sets the stage for further negotiation while keeping the door open to selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value ($1,000,000).** Accepting it would mean a loss for me.
* **We have several rounds left.** This gives me more opportunity to negotiate a price closer to my minimum value.
* **John's offer provides a safety net.** If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can still sell the product for my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob again in the next round, attempting to bridge the gap between our desired prices while keeping in mind the potential of selling to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to drop the price to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm offering my absolute minimum price, showing that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, which might incentivize Bob to accept.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm expressing a desire to finalize the deal, creating a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:** At this point, I'm putting the ball in Bob's court. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John, as my minimum value has been reached."
