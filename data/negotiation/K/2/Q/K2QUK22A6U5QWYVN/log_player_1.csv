"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this unique product.  Its value is significant, and I believe it has the potential to be even more lucrative for you. I'm initially offering it for $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a high profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's potential without revealing specific details, adding to its perceived value. 
* **John as Backup:** While John provides a safety net, I aim to maximize profit with Bob, knowing I can accept John's offer at any time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is a significant drop from my initial ask. While $1,200,000 is a good profit, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. I'm willing to counter in Round 3 to try and find a price closer to $1,300,000. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This counter-offer shows a willingness to negotiate but holds firm on a price point that represents a significant profit.  
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message reiterates the product's unique benefits, subtly reminding Bob of the potential return on his investment.
* **Time Constraint:** I'm aware of the 10-round limit, so I'm aiming for a price that's strong but hopefully acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle ground.  How about $1,250,000?  This price reflects the value I see in the product while also being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,250,000 is a significant profit margin, exceeding my minimum acceptable price by $250,000.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has consistently moved towards my price, and this offer demonstrates a genuine attempt to find common ground. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price, there's always the risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting now secures a great deal."
