{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $180 is way above your maximum budget of $120. There's no point in accepting it. You should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes a clear bargaining point and signals my intent to negotiate.  While this offer may seem too low, it provides room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $160 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating. I'm confident I can get a better price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $110. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but still within my budget constraints. It's also a good compromise point that may be acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $155 is still above my maximum budget of $120. While I'm willing to negotiate, I've already made several counteroffers and we're not making significant progress. At this point, it's more efficient to simply buy the product from John for $120 and avoid further negotiation."
