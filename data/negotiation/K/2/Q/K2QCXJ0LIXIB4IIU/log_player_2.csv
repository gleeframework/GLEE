"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources and increasing your efficiency. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I think it's a fair price considering the potential benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than John's offer, there's room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000 for the product. This still represents a significant profit for you and would be a great deal for me. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and the return it can bring you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,050,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $1,200,000, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a small reduction. Accepting Alice's offer is the best way to secure the product at a reasonable price."
