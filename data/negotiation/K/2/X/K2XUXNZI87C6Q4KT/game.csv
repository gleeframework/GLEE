"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $6000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, so I'm offering the product to you for $10500. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope you'll consider it.",10500.0,Alice,5,
