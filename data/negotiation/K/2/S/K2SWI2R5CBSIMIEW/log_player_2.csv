"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to offer it for $100. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $100 from Alice since you value it at $120. There is room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $90 right now. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  It's a fair price that respects both our needs. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $95, which is within your budget and closer to your desired price. Accepting her offer saves you $25 compared to buying from John.  While you might be able to negotiate further, there's a good chance Alice won't budge much lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
