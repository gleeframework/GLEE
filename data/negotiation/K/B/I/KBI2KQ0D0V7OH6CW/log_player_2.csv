"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget of $1,200,000. This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's seriousness in negotiating a favorable deal.  It's a bold move, but hopefully, it will encourage Alice to consider a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate and has 7 rounds left. Rejecting this offer gives him another chance to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but still wants to try and save some money.  This counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's last offer, but still within the realm of reason, showing Bob's seriousness about securing a deal.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will likely have to accept John's offer, but he wants to exhaust all other options first."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's limit, but it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. With only 5 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. There's a good chance that Alice will not budge further, and Bob may end up paying more than he wants to. Therefore, it's best to secure the product from John at his fixed price, which is within Bob's budget and guarantees a successful purchase."
