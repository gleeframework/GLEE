Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $14,000 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The offer isn't so high that it's likely to be rejected outright, but it allows for a back-and-forth to reach a mutually beneficial price.

Remember, you can always counter-offer Bob if he rejects your initial offer, and you have the option of selling to John if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  While Bob's offer is above John's price, it's still below your desired minimum of $12,000.
* **There's room for a counteroffer:**  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price. 

**Next Steps:** You can counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, perhaps $13,000. This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still protecting your desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about $13,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain your profit:** $13,000 is still above your minimum and allows you to make a decent profit.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's, you demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still holding firm on your value. 
* **Stay above John's offer:**  This keeps the deal more appealing for you than selling to John. 

This counteroffer is a good middle ground that keeps the negotiation moving forward without sacrificing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below your minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below your minimum desired price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob clearly wants the product and is still willing to negotiate, indicating there's room for a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**  Counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, perhaps $12,900.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward and keeps your earnings closer to your desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,750 is getting closer, I'm still a bit below my target price.  Would you be willing to go up to $12,900?  It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Keeps the negotiation moving:** This counteroffer is a small step up from Bob's latest offer, showing your willingness to compromise while remaining close to your desired profit margin.
* **Stay above John's offer:**  This keeps the deal more attractive for you than selling to John.
* **Maintain a fair price:** $12,900 is still below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, making it a good deal for him. 

This counteroffer is a strategic move to inch closer to your target price while keeping the negotiation positive and open to a successful conclusion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,900. I'm willing to go up to $12,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** Bob's offer is only $200 below your minimum desired price of $12,000.  
* **Potential for further negotiation is low:**  Bob has stated his limit and further negotiation may not be fruitful.
* **John's offer is lower:** Selling to Bob at this price is still better than selling to John for $12,000.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the best choice at this point. It allows you to secure a sale with a profit, and while it's not your ideal price, it's a reasonable outcome considering the negotiation process."
