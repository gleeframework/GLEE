"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about $13,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,750. Can you consider that?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,750 is getting closer, I'm still a bit below my target price.  Would you be willing to go up to $12,900?  It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",12900.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,900. I'm willing to go up to $12,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",12800.0,Bob,6,
