Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me in the middle?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's a step closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a more agreeable price."

I'm selling the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I hoped to reach a higher price with Bob, we've reached a stalemate. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal altogether.  The $1,000,000 from John is a guaranteed sale, and it's better than risking a further loss."
