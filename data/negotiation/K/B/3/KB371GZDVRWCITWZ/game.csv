"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  It's still a great price for a product worth more than $100.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $77.50. Would you consider this price?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $77.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $82.50, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen!",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $79.50, but that's as high as I can go. Would you consider this price?",79.5,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $81?  I'm sure we can both be happy with that price. Let's make this happen!",81.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $81 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $79, but that's my final offer. Would you consider this price?",79.0,Bob,8,
