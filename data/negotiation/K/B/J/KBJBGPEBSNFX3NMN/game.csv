"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $975,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $975,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000, Bob. I think you're getting a great deal at that price, considering the product's value is worth at least $1,200,000 to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $950,000. This is my final offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,
