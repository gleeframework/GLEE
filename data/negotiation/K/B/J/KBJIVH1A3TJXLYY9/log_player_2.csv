Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $12,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $12,000. I'm offering the product to you for $13,250. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to walk away.  Alice has indicated this is her final offer and she's unlikely to budge from this point.  You've already secured your best alternative at $12,000 from John, so there's no point in continuing the negotiation and potentially losing out on that deal."
