"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $900000 is below my desired range, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1250000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a final decision.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I'm looking for in the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but unfortunately, $1050000 doesn't cover my minimum requirement.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll accept $1150000 for the product. This price is still fair considering the product's value and its potential benefits to your business.  This is my final offer,  let me know your decision.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid $1150000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $950000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope you can understand my position. If not, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800000.",950000.0,Bob,6,
