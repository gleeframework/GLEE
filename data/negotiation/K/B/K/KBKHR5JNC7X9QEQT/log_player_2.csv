{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $120. This is not a good deal. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $90, which is $10 lower than my maximum price and might be appealing to Alice since she values the product at $100. This allows for negotiation room while still being a good price for me."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum value of $100. I will reject this offer and continue to negotiate.  I can still potentially get a better deal with Alice or go to John if necessary."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price of $100, but I'm getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Alice for a lower price, rather than buying from John right away. I believe I can still save some money by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $100. This is a fair deal for both of us, as it's the price I'm willing to pay and the price she values the product at. Since we're both reaching our limits, it's likely she'll accept this offer. If not, I'll have no choice but to buy from John."
