Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive tone and highlighting the ""great deal"" helps create a positive impression and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Openness:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts the offer, great! I've made a profit.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll evaluate his counter-offer and decide whether to accept it or make a counter-offer of my own.
* If the negotiation drags on, or I feel like I won't be able to get a price I'm comfortable with, I'll sell the product to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get closer to my desired price with a counter-offer. 
* **John is a safety net:** I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price higher than $120 but lower than my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $145? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counter-offer is a compromise between my original price and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" aspect again, reminding Bob that the price is still beneficial to him. 
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for my counter-offer (""closer to what I need to get for the product""), making it seem more reasonable.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a price close to my minimum.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully consider my next move.  I may need to lower my price slightly, but I'll be cautious to avoid going too low.  
* If the negotiation continues to stall, I'll sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $150 threshold. 
* **Risk of going lower:** Accepting $130 might set a bad precedent for future negotiations.
* **John's offer is better:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $150.

**Next Steps:**

Since I'm not willing to go lower than $150, and Bob isn't willing to go higher than $130, I'm going to reject his offer and sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding. However, I'm still needing a price closer to $145. I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $130.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm sticking to my minimum price of $150.
* **Flexibility:** I'm showing flexibility by not completely rejecting Bob's offer, leaving the door open for continued negotiation.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** I'm highlighting the ""middle ground"" aspect, emphasizing that I'm willing to work towards a compromise. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a price close to my minimum.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll re-evaluate my options. If I'm confident I can get a better price in future rounds, I'll continue negotiating. Otherwise, I'll sell to John for $150 to avoid further delays."
