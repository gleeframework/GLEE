"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $145? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",145.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130? That's the highest I can go.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding. However, I'm still needing a price closer to $145. I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $130.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",145.0,Alice,5,
