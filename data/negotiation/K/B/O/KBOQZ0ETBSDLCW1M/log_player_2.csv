"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I know it's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $10,000.  There's a chance you can get a better price from Alice by rejecting her initial offer."
