Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting at $20,000 gives you a buffer to potentially come down while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, hoping to justify the higher price in Bob's mind.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging that Bob might negotiate or reject the initial offer."
