{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has been firm in her offers, and her last offer of $725,000 is only $25,000 more than my target price.  It's getting close to the point where it's worth it to buy from John, so I'm going to accept her offer.  I've managed to save $75,000 from John's price, and I'm confident I can still make a good profit with the product."
