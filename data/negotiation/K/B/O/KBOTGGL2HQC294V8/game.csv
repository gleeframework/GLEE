"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to purchase it for $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9000. I can do $10500. Would you be willing to meet me there?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $10500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal quickly.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500 is not possible, but I can do $10250. That's as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
