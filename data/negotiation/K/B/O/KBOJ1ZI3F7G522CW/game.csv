"I appreciate the product, and I'm interested in purchasing it. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the true capabilities and potential returns this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $925,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $925,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",750000.0,Bob,4,
