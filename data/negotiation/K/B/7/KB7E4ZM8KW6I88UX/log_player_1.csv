"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth it to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above the minimum I'm willing to accept, but still within a reasonable range considering the product's value to Bob. This allows for potential negotiation and gives me room to drop the price slightly if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $15,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, starting at my minimum price is not a good strategy. It's better to try and get a higher price, even if it means going through a few more rounds of negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about $16,500? That's still a good price for both of us, and it's closer to your offer. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 16500}
``` 
I'm making a counteroffer that's halfway between my original offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping that this will be more appealing to Bob than my initial offer, while still getting a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $16,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $15,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. There are only 6 rounds remaining, and I believe I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  How about we split the difference and go with $16,000? It's a fair price considering your budget and the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm making a counteroffer that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's last offer. This shows I'm still willing to compromise but am also trying to get a price closer to what I want.  I'm hoping this will be more attractive to Bob and lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, I'm still a bit over budget at $16,000.  How about we settle on $15,750? It's a compromise for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We are nearing the end of our rounds, and I'm concerned about risking losing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John for my minimum price.  $15,750 is a decent profit, and it's not a huge drop from my previous offer.  It's best to take the offer and secure the sale."
