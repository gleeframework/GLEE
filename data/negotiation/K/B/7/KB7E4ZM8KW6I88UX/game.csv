"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $15,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about $16,500? That's still a good price for both of us, and it's closer to your offer. Let's try to find a middle ground.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $16,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $15,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  How about we split the difference and go with $16,000? It's a fair price considering your budget and the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen!",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, I'm still a bit over budget at $16,000.  How about we settle on $15,750? It's a compromise for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal.",15750.0,Bob,6,
