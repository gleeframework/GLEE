I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a good starting point considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.  I'm aiming for a profitable deal while remaining open to a fair negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for less than $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. This is a compromise, but still a good profit for me.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go lower than $1,500,000.  John is a guaranteed sale at that price, so I'll accept his offer."
