"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a profitable margin for you. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high. How about we settle at $1,275,000? This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,275,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $1,285,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my own investment. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1285000.0,Alice,5,
