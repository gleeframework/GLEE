"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you be interested in buying it from me for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product from John for $100, so you should reject Alice's offer of $90.  You can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $85 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $87.50. Would you be interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $87.50 is within your budget and closer to your desired price than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you $2.50 compared to buying from John."
