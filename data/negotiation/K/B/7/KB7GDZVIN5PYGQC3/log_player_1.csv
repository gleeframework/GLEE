Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but it's still lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept. This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:** By offering a higher price, I create room for negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  The offer is not too far off from Bob's valuation, making it more likely for him to consider it.
* **Be open to counteroffers:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I'll be mindful of my minimum acceptable price.

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and make a decision based on the remaining time and the risk of selling to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is way below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a good price for this product.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer of $150. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell the product to John for $150."
