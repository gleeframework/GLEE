"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential use for my business.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's worth to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I still believe it's worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the benefits the product will bring to your business.",800000.0,Alice,5,
