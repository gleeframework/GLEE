Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for a profit, not just covering your costs.
* **It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation that could lead to a mutually beneficial price.

Remember, your goal is to maximize your profit, but also to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. By starting with a reasonable offer, you increase the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $1,500,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,000,000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a good profit, it's still below the value of the product to Bob.  This means there is room to negotiate further.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Maintain your bargaining power:** Show Bob you're not desperate for a quick sale and are willing to stand your ground.
* **Explore a higher price:** Use the next counteroffer to try and bridge the gap between your current offer and Bob's desired price.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, and you're still far from your minimum."
