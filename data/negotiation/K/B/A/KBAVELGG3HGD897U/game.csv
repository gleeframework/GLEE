"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, $12000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11500 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11000 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I can do $12000 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
