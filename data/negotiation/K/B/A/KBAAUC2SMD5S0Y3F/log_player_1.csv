"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $10,500, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from your price. How about $11,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're still holding out for a higher price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $10,750 is closer to my desired price, but I still think I can push for a bit more. I'll counter-offer again and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $10,750 is a good offer, but I'm still looking for something closer to $11,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,875? This price acknowledges your value for the product and allows me to reach a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,875 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,700. It's a fair compromise that lets us both get what we need.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, it's getting close to my minimum price. It's time to close the deal and avoid risking losing the sale entirely."
