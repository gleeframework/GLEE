"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering the product for $100. This is a good deal, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $90, which is halfway between my maximum price of $120 and Alice's current offer of $100. This is a reasonable counteroffer that shows I'm serious about buying the product but also want a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still within my budget, and it's only $10 more than my counteroffer.  Continuing to negotiate might save me a few dollars, but it risks Alice getting tired of the process and going back to her original price of $100.  It's better to secure the product at a price that's still a good deal for me."
