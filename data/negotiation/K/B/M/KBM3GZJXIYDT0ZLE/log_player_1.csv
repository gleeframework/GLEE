Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise.
