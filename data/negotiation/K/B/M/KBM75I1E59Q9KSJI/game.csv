"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to me is significantly higher. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $6,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?  That seems like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's try to reach an agreement in this round.",8500.0,Alice,5,
