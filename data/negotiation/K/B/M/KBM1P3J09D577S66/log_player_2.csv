"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is higher than both her value for the product and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?"",
 ""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer but higher than her perceived value of the product ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a good deal.
* **Justification:**  Offering a reason (""meet in the middle"") makes the counteroffer seem more reasonable and less like a random lowball. 
* **Goal:**  My goal is to buy for significantly less than John's $12,000 offer and, ideally, closer to Alice's $8,000 value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:**  While Alice came down slightly, she's still significantly above her value and getting closer to John's price. 
* **Negotiating Power:**  I haven't reached a point where accepting John's offer is necessary. I still have room to negotiate with Alice.
* **Target Price:** My aim is to get the price closer to $8,500 or lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $9,000? That's a significant saving for me and still a good deal for you."",
 ""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Alice's price, showing willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price below her last offer.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the mutual benefit (""good deal for you,"" ""saving for me"") can make the offer more appealing.
* **Time Pressure:** While not explicitly stated, as the negotiation continues, the potential savings decrease. I'm applying slight pressure by aiming for a quicker resolution."
