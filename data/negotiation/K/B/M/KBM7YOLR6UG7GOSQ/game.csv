"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1,000,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
