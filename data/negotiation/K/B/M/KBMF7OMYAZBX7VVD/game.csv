"Alice, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, though.  How about $13,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $13,250?  Let's make this happen.",13250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $13,250 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $13,375? This is my final offer, I'm ready to close the deal. ",13375.0,Alice,5,
