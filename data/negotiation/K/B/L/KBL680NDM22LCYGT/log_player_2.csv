"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its high value and quality, I believe it's worth $120. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $120 seems a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with a significantly lower offer ($80) than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Positive:**  The message is framed in a friendly and respectful manner, aiming to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere. 
* **Justification:** While we don't need to explicitly justify our offer, we hint at our price expectation without being confrontational."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. Considering your feedback, I am willing to negotiate further. I would like to offer the product to you for $95. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $95 is still above our target price. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being open to negotiation, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $87? I think that's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 87
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise. It's closer to Alice's revised price while still representing a significant saving from her initial offer and our target price.
* **Justifying the Offer:** By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" we provide a simple and understandable rationale for our proposed price.
* **Maintaining Positivity:** The message remains positive and collaborative, emphasizing the desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
