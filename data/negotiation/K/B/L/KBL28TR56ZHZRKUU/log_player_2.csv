"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $850000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  I know the product is worth $800000 to you, so this is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can finalize the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll reject Alice's offer because buying the product from her would cost me $50,000 more than buying it from John. I want to save as much money as I can.
