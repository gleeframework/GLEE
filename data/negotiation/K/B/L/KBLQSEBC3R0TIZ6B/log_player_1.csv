{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a chance to get a price closer to my minimum while still potentially making a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'm not desperate for a sale, so I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
