"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for this product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its current market value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 undervalues the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $700,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
