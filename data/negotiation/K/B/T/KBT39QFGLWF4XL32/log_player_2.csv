"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $14,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product from John for $10,000.  He should counteroffer Alice and try to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he wants to pay. He can get the same product from John for $10,000. He should counteroffer again and see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, and I'm willing to pay $12,000.  This is my final offer, as I can get the product from another seller for $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty about being able to get the product from another seller for $10,000, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. However, I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I'll throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium warranty and support package worth $1,000. So, the total price would be $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Even with the added bonus, Alice's offer is still $3,000 more than John's offer. He has already counteroffered twice, and Alice is unwilling to go lower.  The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and she's not willing to sell it for a loss.  It's better for Bob to accept John's offer and save $3,000."
