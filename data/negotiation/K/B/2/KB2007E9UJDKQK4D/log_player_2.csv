"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. What do you think?

Bob should buy the product from John. At this point, Alice has offered $11,500, which is still higher than Bob's maximum price.  John offers the product for $10,000, which is a better deal for Bob."
