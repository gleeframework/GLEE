Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's how Alice should approach this offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** Alice has a strong BATNA because she knows John will buy the product for $1,000,000. This means Alice should not accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is only worth $800,000 to Bob. 
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  For a deal to happen, the price needs to be between $800,001 (minimum Bob would pay) and $999,999 (maximum Alice would accept below her guaranteed sale).

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice should aim high but leave some room for negotiation to entice Bob. Here's a possible offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $950,000. I believe this represents a fair price considering the significant returns you'll see."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting at $950,000 sets a strong anchor point, making $800,000 seem like a much bigger jump for Bob.
* **Value Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" helps justify the high price, even if Bob doesn't perceive the full $1,000,000 value that Alice does.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is above Bob's valuation, it leaves space for him to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and Alice can then decide if she wants to accept a slightly lower amount (still above her BATNA) or move on to John. 

**Important Note:** Alice should be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet her price expectations. Her guaranteed sale to John ensures she's in a strong negotiating position."
