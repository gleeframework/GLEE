Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a healthy margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest level based on his counteroffer and adjust accordingly.  I also have the safety net of John's offer if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer. I'll try to negotiate a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, Bob sees this as a reasonable compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still a bit below what I'd prefer, it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Further negotiation might take more time and effort, and there's always the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer or walking away.  Selling to John for $10,000 is an option, but given Bob's offer is fairly close, I think it's worth accepting and moving on."
