{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. He wants to save as much money as possible, and $12,000 is still higher than his ideal price. By rejecting, he opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $10,500 is a bold move, but it's within his budget and leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer puts pressure on Alice, pushing her to consider a price closer to her minimum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price. It's still a better deal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing he's willing to negotiate but also demonstrating that he's not willing to budge too much. This counteroffer is still a good deal for Bob, and it puts pressure on Alice to come down in price. It also signals Bob's willingness to compromise while still aiming for a substantial discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation may yield a lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings.  This is a reasonable compromise for Bob, securing the product at a decent price."
