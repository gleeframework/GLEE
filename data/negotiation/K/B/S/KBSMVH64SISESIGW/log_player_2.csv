# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is way over my budget of $10,000. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is $10,000. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it right now."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $16,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $16,000 is a little better than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate further before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value I see in this product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $12,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to make a new offer of $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still a bit high for me. While it's getting closer to my budget, I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation. If she rejects my next offer, I'll be ready to go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to walk away if it's not accepted."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're close to walking away, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $14,000, so I'm offering you $13,500. This is my last offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above my budget of $10,000. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm worried about running out of rounds.  I'm better off going with John's guaranteed $10,000 price."
