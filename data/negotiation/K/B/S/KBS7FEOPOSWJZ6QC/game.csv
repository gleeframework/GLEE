"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm offering for sale.  I'm asking $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $150 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?  That's my absolute maximum.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While $80 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110? That's still a good deal for a product of this quality.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $95. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to split the difference. How about $102.50? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for a product of this quality.",102.5,Alice,5,
