"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm getting. Can we meet in the middle again?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet at this price, but I'm also keeping in mind that I have another option available",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $980000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one last offer. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product at this price. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
