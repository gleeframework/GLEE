"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it can greatly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness and potential counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** While the price is high, vaguely mentioning the product's ""significant value"" and ""potential"" attempts to justify it without revealing specific details that Bob could use against you.
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a strong safety net.  You have leverage to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if it isn't progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product but I'm only willing to go as high as $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant jump from your initial ask, indicating he's quite interested. While you have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, it's worth negotiating further with Bob as there's a good chance of securing a price well above your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While the product's value is substantial, I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,600,000. I believe this offer reflects the true worth of this opportunity."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You are coming down from your initial offer, but not drastically. This signals flexibility while still aiming for a strong profit margin.
* **Reaffirming Value:**  You are subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to maintain a strong negotiating position. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The new offer still provides space for further negotiation,  with the hope that Bob might counter somewhere above the $1,400,000 midpoint."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm still interested but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob meeting you directly in the middle is a strong signal that this is likely his ceiling price. While you could push for a bit more, the difference is unlikely to be significant enough to risk him walking away. Accepting the $1,400,000 offer secures a healthy profit of $400,000."
