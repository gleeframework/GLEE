Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, but $107 is still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $109. This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to go down to $109, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $109, which would be $104.50. Can you consider that?

It's getting close to the end of our negotiation window, and I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  While I would have liked to get closer to my original asking price, I'm satisfied with a deal that meets my minimum requirement."
