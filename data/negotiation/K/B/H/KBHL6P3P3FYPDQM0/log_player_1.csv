{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations. I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you want to start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Below your minimum:** The offered price is slightly below your $1,500,000 minimum, creating a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob.
* **Above Bob's valuation:**  The price is significantly above Bob's $800,000 valuation. While it's unlikely he'll accept immediately, it leaves room for negotiation if he's truly interested. 

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to gauge Bob's interest level. If he rejects this initial offer, you can assess his counter-offer and decide whether to negotiate further or move on to John, your guaranteed buyer."
