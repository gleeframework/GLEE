"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  While $11,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This would still be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $13,000. I'm still a bit short on budget, so I'd like to make a revised offer of $12,800. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",12800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $12,800 is getting closer.  To make this work, I'd need to come up to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
