{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $14,000 is a good starting point as it's closer to my value ($15,000) than Bob's value ($12,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This allows for some potential compromise and avoids immediately rejecting Bob's possible counteroffer. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter again, keeping in mind my goal of maximizing profit and the possibility of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob is clearly interested, his offer suggests he's willing to negotiate.  I can try to bridge the gap with a counteroffer.
* **Risk of selling to John:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a sure thing, but I might be able to secure a better price through continued negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer, trying to reach a price closer to my value. I'll also keep in mind the possibility of selling to John if negotiations with Bob stall or if his counteroffers remain too low."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  While $11,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This would still be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $13,000 is a compromise between my initial price of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $11,500.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price still leaves some room for further negotiation, as it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasizing value:** The message acknowledges Bob's budget while highlighting that my offer is still a fair deal.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $13,000. I'm still a bit short on budget, so I'd like to make a revised offer of $12,800. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:** While Bob's offer of $12,800 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still not high enough.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm confident I can push for a higher price. Bob is showing interest and willing to negotiate.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I believe there's still potential to get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll also keep in mind John's offer as a safety net."
