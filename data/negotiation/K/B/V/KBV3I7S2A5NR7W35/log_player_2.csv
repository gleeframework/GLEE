"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. There's room for negotiation. It's best to reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the initial gesture, but $1,200,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows for a comfortable profit for you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $850000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1100000. It's a fair price that still reflects its value to me, and I think it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer has come down, it's still significantly above my budget.  I'm not willing to pay more than $800,000 for the product. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice in hopes of getting a lower price, but I also need to be aware of the time limit and the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This price is a reasonable compromise, allowing you to gain a significant profit while still staying within my budget. I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm not willing to go above my $800,000 budget.  I need to keep pushing for a lower price, but also acknowledge that I'm running out of time.  I'll make another counteroffer, but I'll need to carefully consider my next move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm ready to pay $950,000 for the product. This price is a significant step toward your asking price, demonstrating my genuine interest. I'm confident this offer allows us to reach an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1025000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now in round 7, and Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still above my budget.  While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, I'm running out of time.  It's likely that Alice will continue to be stubborn, and I may not be able to reach a price I'm comfortable with. 

To avoid the risk of running out of time and having to accept a higher price, I'm going to take the safe option and buy the product from John for $800,000. It's the best way to guarantee I get the product within my budget and avoid potential further complications with Alice."
