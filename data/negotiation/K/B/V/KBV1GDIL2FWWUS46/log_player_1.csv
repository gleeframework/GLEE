"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,400,000. This leaves room for negotiation and still secures a significant profit for me. It also shows that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'll reject this offer and see what counteroffer Bob makes."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $1,300,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, but still leaves a significant margin of profit for me.  I believe this counteroffer will entice Bob to consider closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a decent compromise.  It's above the $1,000,000 I could get from John, and we're already halfway through the negotiations.  I'll accept this offer to secure the sale."
