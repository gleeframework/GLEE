"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think is very reasonable, considering its value to you. I'm thinking of a price of $750,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing negotiations. He has a clear goal of staying under $800,000, and there's room for Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value this product brings, I'm currently looking to spend closer to $700,000.  Would you be open to considering that?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. How about $725,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise.  While he could potentially try to negotiate further, it's risky to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's advantageous to Bob."
