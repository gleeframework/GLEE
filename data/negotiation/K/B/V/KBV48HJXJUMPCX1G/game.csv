"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $5000 to $7000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $12000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but still reflects the value I place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to reach a compromise. Given my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer for both parties. Looking forward to your response.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll meet you at $10500. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but I'm willing to be flexible to find a deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,
