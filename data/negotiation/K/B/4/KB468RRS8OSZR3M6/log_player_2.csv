"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I'm confident it would be a wise investment.  If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $10000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stating she would sell to another buyer for $10,000, which means the product likely has a value of less than $10,000 to her. You can reject her offer and buy from John at your maximum price of $15,000. This ensures you don't overpay and get the product at your limit."
