Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $140 is still more than Bob is willing to pay, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's above your minimum of $150, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear offer:** The message is friendly and direct, making it clear what you're offering. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I am only willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $150.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $120 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $135?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate, but you're not giving in entirely. 
* **Reasoning:**  You provide a reason for the counteroffer, emphasizing the value proposition for Bob.
* **Open-ended:**  The message encourages further discussion and leaves the door open for Bob to make another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I am still not able to go above $120. Would it be possible for us to meet at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has remained firm at $120, which is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's unlikely further negotiation will get you a better price. Selling to John for $150 guarantees you meet your minimum price and avoids the risk of a prolonged and potentially fruitless negotiation."
