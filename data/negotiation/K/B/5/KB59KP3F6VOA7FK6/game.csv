"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $15,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $12,500? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
