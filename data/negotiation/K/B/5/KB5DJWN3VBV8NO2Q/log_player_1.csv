Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  Since Bob values the product at $120, there's a good chance he'll be willing to pay something closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $105? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only slightly higher than my minimum price of $100, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $115. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a little high for me.  How about $108?  It's closer to your price, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price of $110 that it's worth accepting.  While $108 isn't ideal, it's still a profit for me and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for $100."
