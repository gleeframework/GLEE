"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below your estimated value and still allows me to achieve a strong profit. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $1,400,000, which is still a good deal for you.
* However, rejecting her offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with John. 
* While John is selling for $1,500,000, there's a chance you could negotiate a lower price with him, saving you even more money. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you maintain the option to potentially get a better deal."
