Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and $13,000 is not my ideal outcome. I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial asking price. How about $13,500? That gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I would like to stick to my budget. Let's try $13,000 again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is sticking to his $13,000 offer. While I would prefer a higher price, it's a good deal considering the potential for continued negotiation. If we keep going back and forth, I risk losing the sale entirely or ending up with John's offer of $12,000."
