Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. I believe it's a fair price considering what it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I aim to get a higher price from Bob if possible.
* **Starting High:**  I start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my guaranteed sale price ($15,000) with the hope that he might be willing to negotiate within that range.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might be higher than what Bob perceives. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your desired approach (e.g., quick sale vs. maximizing profit) and your assessment of Bob's negotiating style, you might adjust the offer."
