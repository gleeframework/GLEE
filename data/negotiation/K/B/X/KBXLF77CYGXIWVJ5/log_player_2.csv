"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency by mentioning another buyer. However, it's in her best interest to sell to you for any price above her own valuation of $15,000.
* **Your Best Alternative:** You know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. This is your ""walk-away"" price.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the door for potential negotiation. She might be willing to lower her price closer to your $12,000 limit."
