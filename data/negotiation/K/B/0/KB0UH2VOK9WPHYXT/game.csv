"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $60 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $120. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit much for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $90 is just too low for me. How about $105?  That's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable, but I can't justify going over $80 for this product. If you can do $80, I'm ready to buy right now. Otherwise, I think I might have to check out other options.",80.0,Bob,6,
