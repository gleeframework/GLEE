"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $950,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $1,000,000 at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Dear Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 700000} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge her flexibility. Offering $700,000 is still a significant profit margin for Alice (considering her valuation of $800,000) and keeps me well below my $1,000,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $850,000 for the product. This still reflects its value while allowing for a more favorable deal for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 775000}

**Reasoning:**  Alice came down in her counteroffer, indicating she's willing to move from her initial price. Meeting in the middle shows a willingness to compromise while still moving closer to my target price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm glad you're willing to compromise. I would like to counter your offer with $825,000 for the product. This price still respects its value while offering a reasonable deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is a very competitive offer, considering John is offering me the same product for $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:** 

* **Pressure:** By mentioning John's offer, we're subtly reminding Alice that we have an alternative and putting a bit of pressure on her to make a deal. 
* **Matching Valuation:**  Offering $800,000 matches Alice's own valuation of the product. While she'd ideally like to make a profit, this offer ensures she doesn't lose money and might be tempting enough to accept.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. Increasing the offer now shows Alice we're serious about closing a deal but still want a favorable price."
