Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the special price, but unfortunately, $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. This is my maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering my value for it and your desire to sell. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"", ""final_price"": 125}"
