"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. Given its quality and functionality, I believe it's worth more than what the market typically offers. I am willing to extend this opportunity to you at an exclusive price of $140. This is a special offer considering its value to you, which I understand to be $120. Let's make this deal happen!",140.0,Alice,1,,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the special price, but unfortunately, $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. This is my maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering my value for it and your desire to sell. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",125.0,Bob,2,,
