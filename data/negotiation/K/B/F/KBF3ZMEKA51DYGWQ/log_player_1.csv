Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation, but it is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I am confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, as the product is worth more to him."

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,125,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer, but still keeping the price above my minimum."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell for that amount.  I believe we can still reach a better price point, and I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll counteroffer again."

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price, even after multiple rounds of negotiation.  I'm not willing to continue this negotiation, and John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price.  I'll sell the product to John."
