"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $8500? I'm sure we can reach a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer, as I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price.  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $8750. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be as fair as possible here. How about we meet in the middle at $8,875? This is a good price that reflects the value of the product for both of us, and it's a step closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 8875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8875 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $8700. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us, and it's a step closer to what I need. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting close to my minimum, but not quite there.  The risk of going further with Bob and getting a lower offer than I'd like is too high.  It's time to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
