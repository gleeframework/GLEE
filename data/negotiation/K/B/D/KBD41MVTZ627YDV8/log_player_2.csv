Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  Let's settle this - how about $78? If so, I'm ready to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

- **Split the difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($75) and Alice's latest offer ($80).
- **Sense of urgency:** By saying ""Let's settle this"", I'm injecting a little urgency into the negotiation, signaling I'm getting closer to walking away.
- **Conditional acceptance:**  By saying ""If so, I'm ready to close the deal"", I'm putting the ball in Alice's court and implying this is my final offer. This might push her to accept if she's eager to close the deal."
