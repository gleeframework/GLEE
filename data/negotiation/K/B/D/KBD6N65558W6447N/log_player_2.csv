"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Since you're willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, and John is selling it for that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John ensures you get the product for the price you're willing to pay without the risk of a drawn-out negotiation."
