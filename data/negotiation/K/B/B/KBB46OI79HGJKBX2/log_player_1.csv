This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and encouraging to increase the likelihood of a successful transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That seems like a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great value for you considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price but it's still below $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm feeling optimistic that we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me at this price.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made several concessions.  It's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who's willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to him and avoid further negotiation."
