"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That seems like a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great value for you considering the product's worth.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,800 is still a little too low for me.  Let's try $10,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my willingness to compromise.  What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
