"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,750 is still below what I need to make this work. Would you be willing to go up to $10,250? This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
