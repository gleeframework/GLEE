Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, so you can aim high with Bob.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" aiming to justify a price higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a psychological incentive for Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. Even if you settle lower, you're still likely to get more than your guaranteed $1,000,000.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's personality and your knowledge of him, you might adjust your approach. However, the core strategy is to leverage your strong position to maximize your potential gain."
