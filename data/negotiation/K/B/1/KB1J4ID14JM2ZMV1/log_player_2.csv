Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $105.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 was still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $108. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, it's worth accepting Alice's offer. You're close to your target price, and continuing to negotiate risks that she'll reject your next counteroffer, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price."
