"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product but I'd need to see it for $9,500.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is just too low for me.  How about $10,250?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen!",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a little high for me. I'm ready to buy if you can come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a quick and easy sale.",10000.0,Bob,4,
