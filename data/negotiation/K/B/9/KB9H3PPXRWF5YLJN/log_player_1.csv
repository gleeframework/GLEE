Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging tone increases the chances of Bob engaging in the negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the value to Bob can make the price seem more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** This price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **Knowing my Floor:** I have a safety net of $15,000 from John, so I can afford to be a bit flexible with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still significantly lower. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price. I have a strong backup with John's offer, so I can afford to be a bit more patient and see if I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  I'm open to selling it for $11,000.  This would be a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with Justification:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer while also explaining why it's too low. This sets the stage for a more reasoned negotiation.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Offering $11,000 shows willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** Keeping the communication friendly and encouraging is crucial to keep Bob engaged.
* **Emphasizing Value Again:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value to him helps justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is much closer to my desired price point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away completely. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Accepting $10,500 means we're meeting halfway, which suggests a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Accepting this offer is more profitable than selling to John for $15,000, which is a significant opportunity cost. 

**Overall:**  I'm taking this offer because it's a good compromise that allows me to sell the product quickly and still earn a substantial amount of money."
