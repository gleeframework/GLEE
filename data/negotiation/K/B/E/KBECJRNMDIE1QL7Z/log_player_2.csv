"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, which I believe you'll really love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While the price is higher than Alice's valuation, $12,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $15,000.  Bob should prioritize saving money in this scenario."
