"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. I believe it's a great investment for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $800,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $850,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair compromise given the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to compromise further.",825000.0,Alice,5,
