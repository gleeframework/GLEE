I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, but it gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit. I'm hoping Bob will find the value proposition compelling, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a deal that doesn't reflect the true value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,650,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not the ideal price, it's still a good profit and it avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or even a deal falling through.  I'd rather secure the sale now and move on."
