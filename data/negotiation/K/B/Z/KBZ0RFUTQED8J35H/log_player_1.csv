Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value to Bob, making the offer seem more attractive.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not being inflexible, leaving the door open for counteroffers.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  The option of selling to John for $15,000 gives me a fallback if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below my initial offer of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer closer to my desired price point. 
* **John as a Backup:**  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I have the option of selling to John for $15,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer of $10,500 is the midpoint between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate that this is still a ""good deal"" for Bob, highlighting the value of the product to him.
* **Positive Language:**  I use phrases like ""split the difference"" and ""what do you say?"" to maintain a friendly and collaborative tone.
* **Remaining Firm:**  I'm not willing to go lower than $10,500 as it's still well above my minimum acceptable price and closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can we meet in the middle at $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $10,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Good Compromise:** It represents a reasonable compromise considering Bob's initial offer and my previous counteroffers.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could try to squeeze out another $500, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely if Bob becomes frustrated and walks away. 
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to finalize the sale without further negotiation. 

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision at this point.  I can still make a good profit, and it saves me the time and effort of continued negotiation."
