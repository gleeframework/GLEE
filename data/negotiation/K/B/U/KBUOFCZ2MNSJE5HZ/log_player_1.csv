Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident Bob will be interested in the product, given its value to him, and we can work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $8,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm countering with $8,500. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair compromise given Bob's initial offer. I'm hopeful that we can come to an agreement at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price. Accepting the offer means I can secure the sale and avoid further negotiations."
