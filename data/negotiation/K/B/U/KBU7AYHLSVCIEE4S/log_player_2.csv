"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a great opportunity to get a valuable product at a significant discount. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is tempting, but there's room for negotiation. She's clearly motivated to sell and values the product less than you do. By rejecting her initial offer, you open the door to potentially getting a better price, closer to $8,000."
