,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential and the value it brings.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $1,800,000 is a good price for me. I'd like to make a more substantial offer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
