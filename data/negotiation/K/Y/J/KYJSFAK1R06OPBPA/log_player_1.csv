Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $10,000 is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** This price gives Bob some room to counter without feeling like he's losing too much.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me a strong backup if Bob rejects my offer. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy. If he counters with a low offer, I'll likely reject it and make a counter-offer closer to $10,000. If he's close to my offer, I'll be more flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even my initial offer of $10,000.
* **John is a better option:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a much higher profit than accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While I'm rejecting Bob's offer, I'm not completely shutting down the possibility of a deal. I can make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.  I'll need to gauge how flexible Bob is, and if his counteroffers remain too low, I'll proceed with selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $8,500 is a bit too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $10,000 to $9,500, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $9,500 is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with something.
* **Keeping the Door Open:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to make another counteroffer if he wants.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, I've successfully made a deal. 
* **Prepare for Counteroffer:** If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer.
* **John as a Backstop:**  I still have the option to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $9,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While it's not my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going. There's still potential for me to try and get closer to my desired price in future rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John guarantees $12,000, the risk of a deal with Bob falling through is high. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a decent price while leaving room for further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Continue Negotiation:** I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming to see if I can push the price up a bit further in future rounds.
* **Monitor John's Availability:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option if the deal with Bob falls apart."
