"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000.  This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and how high his perceived value might be.  I also need to leave myself room to negotiate down if needed.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to reassess and adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is a good price, I believe I can do better.  It's only the second round, and I still have time to negotiate. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,800.  This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but it shows that I'm willing to be flexible while still trying to secure a good price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit more, or at least accept this offer.  If he rejects it again, I'll need to reconsider my strategy and decide whether to accept his offer or move on to another buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum value, I still have time to negotiate and I believe I can get a better price. I'm not ready to settle yet, and I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to go any lower. This should put some pressure on Bob to either accept or offer a price closer to my desired range.  If he rejects again, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John and walking away from this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but we've been going back and forth for several rounds, and I'm not convinced he's willing to meet my price.  It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  John is a guaranteed sale, and it's time to move on."
