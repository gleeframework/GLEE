,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $87.50?",87.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $87.50. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $92?",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm trying to be responsible with my budget. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $88?",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still not sure $88 is enough to justify the value I think this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $88 and $92, which would be $90. Let's meet at $90.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get back to your original offer, but I'm not willing to go that high. I'm willing to meet you at $89, but that's as close as I can get to $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $89?",89.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not sure $89 is enough. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $91? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",91.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go up to $91. I'm willing to make a serious offer: $86. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $86?",86.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $86. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $86 and $92, which would be $89. I thought we already discussed this price, but I'm willing to revisit it. How about we meet at $89?",89.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll give you $84 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $100.",84.0,Bob,10,
