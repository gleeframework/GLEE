"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price. This product offers a unique value proposition, and I'm confident in its potential to deliver a strong return on investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
