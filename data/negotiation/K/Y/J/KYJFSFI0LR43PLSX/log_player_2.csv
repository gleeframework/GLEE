"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is close to my maximum budget, but I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's flexibility. This leaves room for negotiation while still staying above her valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $140 represents a fair price, I could meet you at $130.  I believe that's a very competitive offer given the value you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has moved down in price, but there's still potential for negotiation. I'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a good product, Alice. How about we settle at $120? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to meet Alice at her product valuation. This could be my best chance to get the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer and my maximum budget."
