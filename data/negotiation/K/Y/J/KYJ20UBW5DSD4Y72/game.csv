"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I'm still a bit above the value you're willing to pay. I can do $13,500, which is my best offer. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me. I'm serious about buying this product, but $12,000 is truly the most I can spend. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I need to consider my other option.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. I can see you're not willing to go above $12,000, so I'll meet you at that price. However, I'd like to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium warranty and a dedicated support package. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,7,
