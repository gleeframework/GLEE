"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about we settle on $1,100,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000, which is a compromise that should be more in line with the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but that price still feels a bit high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $1,150,000.  That's a significant move on my end, and I think it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
