"Hello Bob, I'm Alice, and I'm offering you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I've done some research and I believe the market value of this product is lower than what you're asking. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $15,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  I've done extensive research on this product as well, and I believe its true value is much closer to my initial price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $12,000. Would you consider $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think $13,250 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $13,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at that price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
