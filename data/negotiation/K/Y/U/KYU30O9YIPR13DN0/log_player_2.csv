"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it provides, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $22,000 is far too high.  It's above Bob's maximum budget, and it's likely Alice is trying to gauge Bob's willingness to pay.  It's better to reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a very low counteroffer to establish a lower price point. It's unlikely Alice will accept this offer immediately, but it sets the stage for negotiations to move in a direction favorable to Bob. He's also emphasizing the product's value to him, trying to create a sense of mutual benefit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $16,000? This price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. There is still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering again will help Bob secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm with his initial counteroffer. This demonstrates his commitment to getting the product at his target price. He's also subtly reminding Alice of the product's value to both parties, aiming to highlight the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
