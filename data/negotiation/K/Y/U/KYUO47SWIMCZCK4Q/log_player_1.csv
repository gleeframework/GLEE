"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $110 is below my minimum value for the product. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $125. Let's meet in the middle on this one."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  That way we both get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I will accept Bob's offer.  While I could sell to John for the same price, I'd rather close the deal with Bob since he's expressed a strong interest in the product."
