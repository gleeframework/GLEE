"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Can you meet me in the middle?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $9,800 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,150? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal.",10150.0,Alice,5,
