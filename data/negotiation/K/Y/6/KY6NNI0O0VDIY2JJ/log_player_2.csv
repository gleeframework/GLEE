"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value. While I can't disclose specifics, I can assure you it's worth no less than $1500000 to me.  I'm confident it will be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $2000000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the potential benefits. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** Alice is asking for $2,000,000, which is more than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer is within budget:** You can get the same product from John for $1,500,000, which is a better deal. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer saves money:**  By rejecting Alice's offer, you save $500,000 and still get the product you want."
