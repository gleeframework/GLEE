"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can agree on.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $85, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $98. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $98 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $85.  It's a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can make a deal this round.",85.0,Bob,6,
