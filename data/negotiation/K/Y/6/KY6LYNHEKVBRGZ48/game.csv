"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This would give us both a fair deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,800 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,000? This feels like a fair compromise, and it would allow me to sell the product without going too far below my target.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a fair compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $8,900?",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $8,900 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, so how about we settle at $8,950?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow us to finally close the deal.",8950.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,900, but I was thinking maybe we could discuss other concessions, such as including some extras or services with the purchase. Can we talk about that?",8900.0,Bob,8,
