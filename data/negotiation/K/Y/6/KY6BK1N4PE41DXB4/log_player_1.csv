"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for a product worth a lot more!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport by emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept a price that is significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at $10,000, which is the value he assigns to the product. While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum of $12,000, accepting his offer is the best option in this round. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a rejection or a further decrease in his offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
