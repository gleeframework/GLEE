Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're getting closer, but it's still worth holding out for a bit more from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""You're definitely closer, Bob. Let's do this - $105, and we have a deal."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I could meet you at $95, but that's absolutely as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While holding out for $100 is tempting, Bob is unlikely to go that high. Taking the $95 offer now is better than risking him walking away and only getting $100 from John."
