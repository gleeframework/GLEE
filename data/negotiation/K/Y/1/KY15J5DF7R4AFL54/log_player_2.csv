"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exceptional opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its immense value to you, we believe it's only fair to offer it at a price that reflects its true worth while ensuring a mutually beneficial transaction. We kindly propose a purchase price of $950,000 for the product. This offer not only allows us to recoup a significant portion of its value but also provides you with an opportunity to secure this valuable asset at a price that is higher than what we would offer to other potential buyers. We look forward to discussing this further and hope to facilitate a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her value:** Alice is willing to sell for $800,000, but offers it for $950,000. This means she's trying to make a large profit.
* **John's offer is your fallback:**  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to negotiate further with Alice or potentially make a counter-offer.  There's a good chance you can get a better price."
