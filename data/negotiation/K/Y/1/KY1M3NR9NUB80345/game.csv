"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm going to need a little more wiggle room on the price.  How about $1,199,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1199000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a bit of wiggle room, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I need to make a profit, and I'm not willing to go as low as $1,199,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
