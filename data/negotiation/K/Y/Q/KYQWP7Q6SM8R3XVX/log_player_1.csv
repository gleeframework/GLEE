Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $14,000 is above your minimum of $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $14,000 is below Bob's maximum of $15,000, giving him room to potentially counter. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This offer provides space for both of you to negotiate and potentially find a price that works for both parties.

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's reaction and the potential for a better deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $13000 for the product. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my ideal price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target of $14,000.  Selling to John for $12,000 would be a loss compared to what Bob is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position.  While I value your interest, $13,000 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to make a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
