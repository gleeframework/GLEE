"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $100 is too low for this product.  It's high quality and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $170 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $110? I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",110.0,Bob,4,
