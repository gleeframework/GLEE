Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you perceive the product's value to be very high.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""unique value proposition"" and ""true worth"" aims to pique Bob's interest and make him curious about why you value it so highly.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""proposing a starting price"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal that you're open to hearing Bob's perspective and potentially negotiating.

By starting high, you can gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate while still keeping your minimum price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum:**  $900,000 is considerably less than your $1,500,000 bottom line.
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer suggests he's interested but trying to secure a favorable price. This is where your negotiation skills come in. 
* **You have a backup option:** The guaranteed offer from John gives you leverage. You're not desperate to accept a low offer. 

**Next Steps:** You should counteroffer with a price significantly lower than your initial offer but still above your minimum. This demonstrates flexibility while emphasizing the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer. I understand your perspective on the market value, however, the value of this product extends beyond typical market conditions due to its unique features.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,750,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to see this deal through."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Offer:** Showing you understand his position can help foster a collaborative atmosphere in the negotiation.
* **Reiterate Value:** By subtly highlighting the product's ""unique features,"" you're reminding Bob why it's worth more than his initial offer.
* **Significant Reduction, but Above Minimum:**  The counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while staying significantly above your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Urgency and Willingness:** Mentioning your desire to ""see this deal through"" adds a subtle sense of urgency without sounding desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeds Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above your $1,500,000 minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strong Negotiating Position:** While you could push for a slightly higher price, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and has met you closer to your range.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a profitable deal."
