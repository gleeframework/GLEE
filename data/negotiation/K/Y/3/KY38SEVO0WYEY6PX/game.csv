"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer. I understand your perspective on the market value, however, the value of this product extends beyond typical market conditions due to its unique features.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,750,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to see this deal through.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
