"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,000,000, so my new offer is $1,050,000. I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
