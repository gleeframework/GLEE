I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This price is a good starting point as it's a bit higher than my minimum but still lower than what the product is worth to him. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob decides to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
