"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit margin.  I'll see if Bob is willing to play ball. If he's not, I'll gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,600,000 is a decent price, but I believe I can get closer to my asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to $1,700,000. This shows flexibility while still leaving room for negotiation. Hopefully, Bob sees this as a reasonable offer and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of going lower and reaching the $1,200,000 offer from John is too high. Accepting this offer ensures a decent profit and avoids potential losses."
