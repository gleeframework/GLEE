"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and gives you a good profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we settle on $950000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's worth to me. Let's find a mutually agreeable solution.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000. This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away satisfied.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $900000.  It's getting closer, but it's still a bit low for me.  How about we meet at $975000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away happy.  We're both so close to a deal, let's finalize it!",975000.0,Alice,5,
