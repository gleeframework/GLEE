"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Positive Tone:**  I use a positive and enthusiastic tone to build rapport and encourage acceptance. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) as possible. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffers based on his responses and the remaining rounds. I also have the safety net of selling to John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and gives you a good profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.  
* **Remaining Rounds:** I have 8 rounds remaining, giving me time to potentially improve the offer.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $1,000,000, but still higher than his initial proposal. I'll try to find a middle ground that is more appealing to him while still being profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we settle on $950,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's worth to me. Let's find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's roughly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Highlighting Benefits:** I reiterate the benefits for Bob by mentioning that it's still a ""great deal"" for him. 
* **Finding Common Ground:**  I emphasize the need for a ""mutually agreeable solution,"" implying a collaborative approach to finding a compromise.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he rejects, I'll continue adjusting my offer in subsequent rounds, taking into account his previous responses and the remaining negotiation time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000. This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation Room:** There's still some room to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.
* **Remaining Rounds:** I still have 6 rounds remaining, which is enough time to continue the negotiation process.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that is higher than his offer but still lower than my previous offers.  I aim to find a compromise that is mutually beneficial and allows me to achieve a better price than what he's currently offering."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $900,000.  It's getting closer, but it's still a bit low for me.  How about we meet at $975,000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away happy.  We're both so close to a deal, let's finalize it!"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm increasing the price only slightly from Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still staying above my target.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm emphasizing the word ""compromise"" to make my offer feel more reasonable and fair.
* **Urgency:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by mentioning that we're ""so close"" to a deal.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to test Bob's willingness to come closer to my desired price point. If he rejects again, I'll have to consider whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or simply selling to John."
