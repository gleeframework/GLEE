"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you is $800000.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000. While it's a good deal for you in terms of the product's value to you, it's still too expensive. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and gives you a good profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we settle on $950000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's worth to me. Let's find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still above your budget.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $900000.  It's getting closer, but it's still a bit low for me.  How about we meet at $975000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away happy.  We're both so close to a deal, let's finalize it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still above your budget, and you've already been through several rounds of negotiation.  While there's a chance you could get a better deal by continuing, it's becoming increasingly risky. You've only got 5 rounds left, and it's possible Alice won't budge further. 

To guarantee you get the product within your budget, it's best to buy from John for $800,000. You can be certain of the price and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
