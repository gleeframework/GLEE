"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,300,000 represents a fair reflection of the product's true worth, I understand the need to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer takes into account the unique value this product brings."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Even though Bob's offer is now above John's standing offer, we are still early in negotiations.  I believe I can push for a price closer to $1.8 million."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to compromise further, but $1,600,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  How about we settle at $1,900,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hopeful we can reach a deal, but $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my part and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we could continue pushing for a slightly higher price, Bob is clearly committed to negotiating and his offer is strong. Accepting $1,700,000 secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
