"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,300,000 represents a fair reflection of the product's true worth, I understand the need to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer takes into account the unique value this product brings.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to compromise further, but $1,600,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  How about we settle at $1,900,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hopeful we can reach a deal, but $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my part and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
