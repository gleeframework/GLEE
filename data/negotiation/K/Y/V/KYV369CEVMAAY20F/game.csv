"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking to my offer of $105.  If that doesn't work for you, I'll be happy to buy it from John for $100.",105.0,Bob,4,
