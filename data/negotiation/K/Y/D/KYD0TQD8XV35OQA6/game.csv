"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $11,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,200 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $10,750 for the product. This is a fair offer, considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,750 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $11,000. This is as close to my minimum as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
