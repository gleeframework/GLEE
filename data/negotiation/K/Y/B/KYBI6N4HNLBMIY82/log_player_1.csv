"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a fair offer, considering the product is worth $120 to Bob and at least $100 to me. I want to leave room for negotiation, but also maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is my minimum, I can do better than that. Bob clearly wants the product, and I believe I can get a higher price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $105. I'm still above my minimum, and this demonstrates flexibility to Bob while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
