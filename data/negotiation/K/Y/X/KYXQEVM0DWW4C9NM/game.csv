"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a lower price, and I get a sale that's above my minimum. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,1,
