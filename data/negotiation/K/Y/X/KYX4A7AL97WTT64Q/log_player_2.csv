"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, you have room to negotiate further. You know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, so there's a significant margin to work with. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price from Alice."

```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's original price, but it's still within your budget and leaves room for negotiation.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $750000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?
