Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $8,000,  we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay more, especially if he perceives a benefit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A starting price of $12,000 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving Alice an opportunity to either meet him somewhere in the middle or still walk away with a good profit by selling to John. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning listing it publicly, Alice subtly creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quicker.

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's potential profit while still offering Bob a price that could be appealing if he values the product's benefits."
