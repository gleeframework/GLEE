"I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $975,000, which would be $937,500. This is my final offer.",937500.0,Bob,4,
