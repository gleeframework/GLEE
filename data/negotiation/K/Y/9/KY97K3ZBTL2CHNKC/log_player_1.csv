Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 positions it closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) while still leaving a significant margin above your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). 
* **Open Communication:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, setting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I believe the price is a little high. Would you consider a lower price of $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,500,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a price that reflects the product's true worth. You're still open to negotiating with Bob, but you're not willing to accept a lowball offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, I believe my initial offer fairly reflects the product's value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** The message starts by acknowledging Bob's viewpoint and expressing a desire to find common ground, fostering a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Strategic Concession:**  The counteroffer reduces the price by $100,000, a significant move that demonstrates flexibility. 
* **Holding Ground:** The new price of $1,300,000 is still comfortably above your minimum acceptable price while moving closer to Bob's initial counteroffer. This signals that you're serious about selling but not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While that's closer to what I had in mind, could we settle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer matches your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While you could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the difference is relatively small at this point. Accepting this offer ensures a successful sale and a good profit without risking the deal by pushing Bob too far."
