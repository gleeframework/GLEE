"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer. While I understand your position, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This is a competitive offer considering its unique value.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
