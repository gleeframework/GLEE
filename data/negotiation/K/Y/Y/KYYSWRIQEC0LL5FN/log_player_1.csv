Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and I'm offering it to you before considering other buyers. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a strong offer that still represents significant value to Bob (who values it at $800,000) while leaving you a substantial profit margin. 
* **First Refusal Incentive:** By emphasizing that Bob is the first to receive an offer, you create a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially motivating him to accept."
