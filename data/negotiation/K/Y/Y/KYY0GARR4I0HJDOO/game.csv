"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately too far below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $102.50 is closer, but I'm really working with a tight budget.  Could you do it for $95?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you on the budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $100?  That's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
