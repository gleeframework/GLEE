"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $115 is too close to my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for compromise.  We'll see how Alice responds and adjust accordingly in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately too far below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to my budget, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to $100. It's worth another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  $102.50 is closer, but I'm really working with a tight budget.  Could you do it for $95?  That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

This counter-offer shows Alice we are willing to compromise, but still aims for a price closer to our target. We're getting closer to a potential deal!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you on the budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $100?  That's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met our target price of $100. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or buying from John at the same price."
