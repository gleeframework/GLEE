Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in! I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's significantly higher than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring you get a good profit if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum, you can potentially get more. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob! While $150 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $175?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is only $10 less than your counteroffer and is closer to your minimum than selling to John.  This is a reasonable compromise that allows you to close the deal and avoid further negotiation."
