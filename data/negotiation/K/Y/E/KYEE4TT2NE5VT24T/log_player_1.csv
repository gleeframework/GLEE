"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you. My starting price is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation. It's a common tactic to set the anchor point high.
* **Highlight Value:** My message emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I signal that I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $800,000 from John gives me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1200000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its potential value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum of $800,000, it's still not a price I'm willing to accept at this stage. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe I can still push for a higher price. I have more rounds to negotiate and the threat of selling to John. 
* **Counter-offering is the next logical step:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to acknowledge your interest. This price still reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal. Let's work together to finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within a reasonable range:** I've lowered my price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. This is a significant concession while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm using phrases like ""good deal"" and ""work together"" to foster a sense of collaboration and potential mutual benefit.
* **Maintaining the ""John"" leverage:** By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I'm subtly reminding him that I have other options."
