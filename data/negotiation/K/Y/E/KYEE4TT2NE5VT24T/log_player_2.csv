# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you. My starting price is $1200000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its potential value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000 to acknowledge your interest. This price still reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal. Let's work together to finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
