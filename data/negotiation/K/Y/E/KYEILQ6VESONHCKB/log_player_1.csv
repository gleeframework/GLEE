Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since I'm looking to earn as much money as I can for the product, I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly higher than its value to him.

{""product_price"": 1,100,000}

This offer is $100,000 more than the product's value to Bob, which gives me a good profit margin. Let's see if Bob accepts or rejects this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $900,000. This is lower than the product's value to him, so I'm not thrilled about it.

However, I don't want to give up on the negotiation just yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer of my own.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll offer Bob a price of $950,000, which is still a bit higher than his initial offer but lower than my initial offer. Let's see if he's willing to meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send my counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 950,000}

This offer is $50,000 more than Bob's initial offer, which I hope will be more appealing to him. Let's see if he's willing to meet me halfway!"
