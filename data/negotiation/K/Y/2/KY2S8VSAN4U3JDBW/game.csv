"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable for you.  Let's start with a price of $1,150,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,125,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the benefits you'll gain from this product.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try one more time to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to drop to $1,100,000 for this incredible product. I believe this is a great deal for both of us, and we can finalise this agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
