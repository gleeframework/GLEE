Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable for you.  Let's start with a price of $1,150,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I am willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,150,000.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,125,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the benefits you'll gain from this product."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I am willing to pay $1,075,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting to take $1,075,000, I'm still hoping to close the deal closer to $1,100,000. I have a few rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too far below my target.  I'll try one more time to negotiate with Bob before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try one more time to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to drop to $1,100,000 for this incredible product. I believe this is a great deal for both of us, and we can finalise this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
