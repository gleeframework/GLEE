{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $100 is more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** $100 is still below Bob's perceived value of $120, giving him room to negotiate a price that's more favorable to him. 
* **It shows you're willing to be flexible:** By offering a price lower than your initial assessment, you show Bob you're open to negotiation. 

By starting with this offer, you maximize your chances of striking a deal with Bob while still protecting your minimum profit margin."
