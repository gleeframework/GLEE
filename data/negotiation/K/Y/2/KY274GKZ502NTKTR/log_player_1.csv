``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows you are willing to compromise while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $12000. Would you consider reducing the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet. I can try to get closer to my desired value with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a specific price point. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which still represents a fair value for the product.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
