"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high with $20,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and leaves room to potentially lower the price if necessary. I want to maximize my earnings, but I also want to be open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, it's important to remember that I have 10 rounds and John is willing to pay $15,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer and my minimum value.  It shows that I am willing to compromise while also giving Bob a chance to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a decent improvement. It's closer to my desired price, and it's still significantly better than selling to John for $15,000. I'm going to accept this offer and move on."
