{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get close to my minimum price of $12,000, but I'm also willing to compromise a little to secure the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you considering me. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value for the product, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $10,500 isn't enough for me to let go of the product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,250 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  I'm confident we can both be happy with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob has come up to $11,000, that's still below my minimum value for the product.  While I'm happy he's shown interest, I'm not willing to go lower. It's better to sell to John for my desired price rather than risk further negotiations with Bob."
