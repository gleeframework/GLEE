Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I know you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it for $11,000.  I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, meaning he'd gain $1,000 in value by purchasing it for $11,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering it at $11,000 maximizes Alice's potential profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Backup Option:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below her minimum price of $8,000.

By starting with a strong offer slightly below Bob's valuation, Alice increases her chances of closing the deal quickly and for a higher price than her fallback option."
