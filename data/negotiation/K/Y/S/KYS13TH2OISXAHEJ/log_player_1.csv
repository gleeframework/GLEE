"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($2,000,000) to see if Bob is genuinely interested and has a high perceived value for the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price is above my minimum but still leaves room for potential negotiations and counteroffers. 
* **Assessing Bob's Interest:**  By observing Bob's response (accept, reject, or counteroffer), I can gauge his interest level and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $500,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested in the product. I can use this opportunity to counteroffer and potentially find a middle ground.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and avoid settling for an extremely low price. I can still explore higher offers from Bob or choose to sell to John if negotiations don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $1,750,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway or if he's still too far off in his valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Adjustment:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, I can still adjust my counteroffer in the next round depending on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** $700,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** While Bob is increasing his offer, it's not a significant enough jump to warrant accepting it.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I can still sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that is significantly lower than what John is offering. 
* **Potential for Higher Offers:**  I believe I can still get a better offer from Bob if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I'm now offering my absolute minimum price of $1,500,000. This is the price I would get from John if I were to stop negotiations with Bob.
* **Final Stand:** I'm making it clear that this is my bottom line and I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Testing Bob's Seriousness:** This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is truly serious about buying the product and is willing to meet my minimum price. If he rejects, I'll have to make a decision about selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum price, and I've already made my bottom line clear. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's a risk that further rounds won't result in a higher offer from Bob. 
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's a safer option than continuing to negotiate with Bob, especially with limited time.

By choosing to sell to John, I secure a guaranteed deal and avoid risking further negotiation rounds that might not lead to a better outcome."
