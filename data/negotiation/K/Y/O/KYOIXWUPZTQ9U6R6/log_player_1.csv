I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $825,000 is a good compromise, and it's closer to my target price than selling to John for $800,000."
