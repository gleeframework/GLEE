"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I think the product's value is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $11,000? ",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to negotiate, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
