Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to negotiate, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $12,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $12,000. It's in your best interest to cut your losses and buy from John at the known price of $12,000."
