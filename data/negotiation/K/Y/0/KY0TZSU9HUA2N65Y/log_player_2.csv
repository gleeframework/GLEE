"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial one, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target.  There are still multiple rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal quickly. "", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $887,500, but that's as low as I can go. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target:** $887,500 is a significant discount from the original price and is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $875,000.
* **The risk of going higher:**  Rejecting Alice's offer means Bob risks having to pay the full $1,000,000 to John.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** There are only 5 rounds left.  It's unlikely Bob can negotiate a significantly lower price in such a short timeframe.

Accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal for Bob without the risk of having to pay a much higher price to John."
