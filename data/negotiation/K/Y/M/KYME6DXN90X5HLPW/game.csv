"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $20,000 represents the high-end value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we try $16,250? I think that's a fair compromise.",16250.0,Bob,4,
