"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $13,000. I think this is a great deal considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than buying from John, Bob can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $12,500?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13,250. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he might be able to squeeze a bit more out of her, it's not worth the risk of a protracted negotiation.  $13,250 is still a decent price and much better than buying from John."
