Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While Bob values the product at $8,000, I don't know his upper limit. Starting with a price closer to my minimum ($15,000) gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $12,000 offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price higher than $8,000 but still acceptable to me.
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly avoids the hassle of finding another buyer (even though John is lined up) and secures the sale. A slightly lower price now might be preferable to waiting.
* **Justification:** By framing the offer as a ""special opportunity"" before a public listing, I create a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he declines."
