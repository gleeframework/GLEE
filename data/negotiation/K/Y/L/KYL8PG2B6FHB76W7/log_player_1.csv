# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $700000 to $800000. I believe this price range reflects the value I am willing to pay for the product. Please let me know if we can reach an agreement within this range.
