"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it's even more valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not that much. I'm offering $1350000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
