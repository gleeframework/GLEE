Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it's even more valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to close the deal,  $1,250,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I want to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not that much. I'm offering $1,350,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,300,000 is a good price, and it's important for me to close this deal.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle with John for a lower price."
