"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I think $14,000 is a fair starting point for the discussion. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. It's worth rejecting and seeing if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount. While it's unlikely Alice will accept it immediately, it shows my serious intent to negotiate and sets a lower price range.
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting my budget and perceived value, making it seem more reasonable. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** My message ends with a question, inviting Alice to engage in further discussion and potentially reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my target of $10,000. It's worth pushing for a lower price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** My counteroffer is a smaller increase than Alice's, showing a willingness to negotiate but also maintaining my position. 
* **Finality:** I clearly state this is my final offer, putting pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Alternative Option:** Mentioning other options (John) adds urgency and strengthens my bargaining position."
