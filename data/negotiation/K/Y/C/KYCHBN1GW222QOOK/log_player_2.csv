"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is less than Bob's maximum price of $10,000, he can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500, which is halfway between Alice's desired price of $8,000 and his own maximum price of $10,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $9,200 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his previous offer of $8,500.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price. There's still a chance Alice might come down in price, and buying from John for $10,000 is still a worse outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer by $300 to $8,800. This is a smaller increase than before, showing Alice he's willing to negotiate but also not willing to pay a significantly higher price. This offers a compromise and potentially motivates Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to Bob's maximum price.  However, the negotiation seems to be stalling, and Alice is not willing to go lower than $9,500.  It's becoming less likely that Alice will accept a lower offer in the next round.  At this point, buying from John for $10,000 is the best option, as it guarantees Bob will get the product while minimizing potential further losses in negotiation."
