Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not ready to go as low as $110. I can do $130, but that's my final offer. I think it's a fair price for the product 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

```

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $125, and she's now trying to increase the price. It's better to buy from John for $120 and avoid potentially wasting more time."
