"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for a price that reflects its exceptional worth.  I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, so I'm willing to negotiate.  Please consider my offer of $900,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still a significant markup from her valuation of $800,000. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price in a counter-offer. 

You always have the safety net of buying from John for $1,000,000, so there's room to negotiate with Alice."
