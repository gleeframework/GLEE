You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $15,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $18,000. It's not a good deal.  Rejecting her offer gives you the chance to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
``` 

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, reflecting the fact that you're only willing to pay what the product is worth to you. This strategy aims to get the negotiation started and gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to you. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting this offer allows you to continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

This counteroffer is a small step up from your previous offer, but still under what Alice is asking for. The goal here is to continue showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product but that you're also not going to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still higher than what the product is worth to you, and you have enough rounds left to continue negotiating. By rejecting, you can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
