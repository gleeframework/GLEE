"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable and worth $150 to me. Considering its worth to you is $120, I believe we can find a fair deal. I'm offering it to you for $135, which is above its value to you but still below my personal valuation. Would you like to make this yours? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer
