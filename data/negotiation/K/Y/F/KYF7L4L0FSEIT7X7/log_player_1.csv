"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm going to start high!  Since my minimum is $1,200,000 and I know John will pay that, I'm going to see if Bob is willing to meet my price right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me and hopefully it's attractive enough for Bob to consider. I'm trying to find a balance between getting the best price and not risking losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, I'm still holding out for a better price. $900,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm willing to meet him halfway and that he'll be willing to increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm starting to get a bit nervous about the number of rounds left, I'm still not willing to settle for such a low price.  $880,000 is way too far from my minimum, and I'm hoping that I can convince Bob to come up a bit more with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,000,000.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, so I need to be a bit more flexible. This price is still above my minimum, and it's a fair compromise considering Bob's previous offers. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize this and finally agree to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. We're down to the last few rounds, and Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower.  While I'd love to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to drop my price any further.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so I'm going to go with the secure option."
