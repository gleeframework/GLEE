Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make a counteroffer of $800,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I must respectfully decline. While I understand the value you place on the product, I still feel that $800,000 represents a fair valuation based on my assessment. I hope this offer is acceptable to you.

Bob seems firmly anchored at $800,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the best way to ensure I get a fair value for the product."
