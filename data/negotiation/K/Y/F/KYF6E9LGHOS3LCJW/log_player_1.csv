Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $8,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. It's important to start high and then be willing to negotiate down to a price that's still acceptable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price and it's likely he won't go much higher. Accepting his offer guarantees me a good profit, and it's better than risking a further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or even a rejection from Bob."
