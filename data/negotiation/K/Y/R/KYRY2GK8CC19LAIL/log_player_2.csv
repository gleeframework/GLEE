"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $135.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $135 is within your budget, you can try to get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price in a counter-offer. If her price doesn't come down enough, you can always buy from John for $150."
