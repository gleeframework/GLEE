"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $105?  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",105.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a little too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight.  How about we split the difference and go with $120? It's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
