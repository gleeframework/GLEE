"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $1,400,000 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a clear goal: save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm happy to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $1,300,000.** This is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $1,400,000.
* **Bob's goal is to save money.** Accepting this offer saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation.** If Bob rejects and makes a counteroffer, Alice might not accept it, and Bob might end up paying more or having to buy from John at a higher price.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous decision for Bob at this stage."
