"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it at $150. This means she has a significant profit margin. It's highly unlikely she'll accept a counteroffer that's significantly lower than $150, and it's best to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a bold offer, but it's worth trying to see if Alice will accept. It's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay, and it leaves her a profit margin of $20. If she rejects, I can always buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

Alice's offer of $130 is a reasonable compromise. It's within my budget and still allows Alice to make a profit.  It's not as good as getting it for $100, but I'm willing to accept a slightly higher price for a product that's worth $120 to me."
