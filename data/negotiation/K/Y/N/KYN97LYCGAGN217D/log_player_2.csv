Round 5

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the ongoing discussion, I am willing to accept $13,875 for the product. This price reflects both the value of the item and your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,875, which is a good price for Bob. It's a significant saving compared to John's price of $15,000, and it's within Bob's budget.  There's always the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially getting a lower price, but it's also possible that Alice might refuse to go any lower.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price, minimizing his risk."
