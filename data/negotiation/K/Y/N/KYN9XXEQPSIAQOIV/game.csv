"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your need to profit, Alice, and I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1000000 for the product.  This would give you a decent profit margin, and it's right at the edge of what I'm willing to pay.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000 yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1050000, so my counteroffer is $1025000. This is my best and final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
