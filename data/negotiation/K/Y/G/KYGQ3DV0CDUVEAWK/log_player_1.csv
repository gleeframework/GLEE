Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $20,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to accept a lower price or stick to John's guaranteed $15,000.
* **Maximizing Potential Profit:**  While the product is worth $15,000 to you, there's a chance to earn more if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer and selling to John at your minimum price."
