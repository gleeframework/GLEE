# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $18,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both my limit and John's offer. There's room for negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is quite high for my budget. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for the product. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

While Alice is coming down, $14,000 is still too high. I'll try to negotiate further, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Could we meet somewhere around $12,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

Alice is getting closer to my range, but I believe there's still some room for negotiation before I consider going above John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to work with me. I see that we're getting closer. How about $12,500? That's a significant jump from my last offer and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal happen."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're close to a deal. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, so I hope we can shake hands on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
``` 

Alice seems firm at $13,000, and even though it's close to my limit, I have a guaranteed offer from John at $10,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice when I can save a significant amount with John."
