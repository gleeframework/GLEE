# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $725,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $800,000."
