"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $650,000. I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $725,000?  That feels like a reasonable compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $725,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
