"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $850,000 for this product.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $750,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're committed to this price point, but I still need to reach a higher value for this product. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a significant compromise for me. Let's finalize this deal at this price, so we can both move forward.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point, and I appreciate your persistence. How about we split the difference at $810,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it's still within a reasonable range for me.",810000.0,Alice,7,
