"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $100. It's a great value considering its worth to you is $120.

You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet the product's value to you. In response, I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer. $95 is still less than what you are willing to pay for the product, and it's a better deal than buying it from John."
