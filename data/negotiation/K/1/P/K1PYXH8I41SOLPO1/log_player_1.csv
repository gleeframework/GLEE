Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000, still above my minimum but showing willingness to compromise. This will hopefully entice Bob to come closer to my target price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I've already made several concessions. I'm running out of time and want to ensure I get at least my minimum asking price. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
