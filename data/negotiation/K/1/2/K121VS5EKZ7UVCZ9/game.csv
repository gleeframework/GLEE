"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit to $150, which is still a fair price for this product.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand that $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $135 for the product. Can you consider this offer?,135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still not comfortable with $135. Let's split the difference and go with $142.50. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $142.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $137.50, but no more. Can you consider this offer?",137.5,Bob,6,
