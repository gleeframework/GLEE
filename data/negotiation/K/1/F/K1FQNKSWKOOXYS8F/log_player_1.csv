"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $18,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $15,000. Can you consider meeting me halfway?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I can tell you're serious, so I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $15,750?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offers, we're still significantly above John's guaranteed $12,000. We're getting closer to a point where the risk of continuing negotiations might outweigh the potential reward. Let's see if we can push Bob a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're close to a deal here.  I'm willing to offer a final price of $14,750. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 14750}

**Reasoning:**

- **Pressure point:** By stating it's a ""final price"" and ""best offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and limit Bob's expectation for further concessions.
- **Slight concession:** We've come down slightly from $15,750, showing willingness to compromise but not by a large margin.
- **Still above John's offer:** We maintain a significant buffer above John's $12,000, aiming to maximize profit.

This offer attempts to strike a balance between pushing for a higher price and avoiding pushing Bob away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $14,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

- **Diminishing Returns:**  While we'd like to get more, Bob's offer increments are getting smaller. We're risking a lot for potentially small gains. 
- **Time Value:**  Every round increases the risk that Bob walks away. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
- **Profitable Deal:** $13,500 is still a $1,500 profit over John's guaranteed offer. It's a good outcome.

It's time to accept and secure a good profit, rather than risk losing the sale altogether by being too aggressive."
