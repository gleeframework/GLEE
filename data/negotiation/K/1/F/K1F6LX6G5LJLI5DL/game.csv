"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $60 is low, but $120 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? That seems like a fair compromise.",80.0,Bob,4,
