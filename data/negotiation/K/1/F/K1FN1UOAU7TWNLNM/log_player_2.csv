Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks promising, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:** I've started with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility on price. This gives us room to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable figure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to her product's value.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of success and I risk losing the opportunity to buy below my maximum budget."
