"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my value for the product. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, at $108.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think.",108.5,Alice,5,
