"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe could be highly beneficial for you. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $11,500. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm still not sure I can justify spending $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10,750. Can you consider this price?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about $10,900?  This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10,900. I'll try to meet you halfway from that, so I'll counter with $10,450. Can you consider this price?",10450.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product and what it can do for you.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $10,800, but that's my final offer.",10800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $10,800 is the best value for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10,225. Can you consider this price?",10225.0,Bob,8,
