Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $140 is higher than Bob's $120 valuation, giving him a reason to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's a friendly tone:**  This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

I'll be ready to respond to Bob's counteroffer, or make a new one if needed, to maximize my profit!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is a good starting point, but it's still below my minimum price of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $132.50? Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $132.50 is now above my minimum of $150 and closer to my counteroffer of $135.  It's a good compromise and ensures I make a profit.  I'm going to accept his offer and finalize the sale."
