Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1550000. This takes into account the value of the product to you and allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, it's still above your maximum of $1,500,000.  You can try one more counteroffer to see if you can get her down to your desired price.  If not, buying from John at $1,500,000 is the next best option."
