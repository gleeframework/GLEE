"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a great product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,200,000 is closer, it's still below the value I've assessed for this product.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price acknowledges your financial considerations while also reflecting the product's significant potential.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate the continued negotiation.  While $1,150,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below the value I've assessed for this product.
