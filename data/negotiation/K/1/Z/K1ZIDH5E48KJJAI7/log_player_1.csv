I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price, but it's still reasonable enough to be attractive to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm reducing my price to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise, but still well above Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still offering a price that is far too low.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's becoming clear that Bob is not willing to pay a price that is close to my minimum.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is the best option at this point."
