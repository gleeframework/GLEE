"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly rated by many satisfied customers. Considering its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what others are paying, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's aim for something around $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $140 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a mutually beneficial solution. I am willing to consider your offer of $125, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return for my product. Would it be possible for us to meet somewhere in the middle? How about $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $135 is still a bit outside my price range. Let's try $130.  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to purchase the product without going over my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
