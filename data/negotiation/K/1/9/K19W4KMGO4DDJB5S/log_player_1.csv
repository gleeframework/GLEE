Round 2

Round 3

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still think I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting close.  To be honest with you, my budget caps out at $1,200,000.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'll sign the paperwork today.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I'd like to get a bit more, Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is now the same as John's offer. Since I'm under time pressure, I'll choose to sell to John. It's guaranteed and I don't have to risk further negotiation with Bob."
