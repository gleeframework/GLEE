"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is high, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our ongoing negotiation, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This would allow both of us to achieve a satisfactory outcome.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. However, given my financial constraints, I am unable to meet $1,075,000.
