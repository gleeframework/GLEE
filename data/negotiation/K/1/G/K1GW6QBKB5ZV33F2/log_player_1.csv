"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is undeniable, and I believe it can significantly benefit your endeavors. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, subtly anchoring Bob's perception at a high level.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay and sets the stage for potential counteroffers. 
 
It's a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring I don't alienate Bob with an unrealistically high starting price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a fair price given its potential.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). While his offer is above my guaranteed sale price with John, I have room to negotiate and aim higher. I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I must admit, $1,050,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product's true potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its inherent value."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a compromise by meeting Bob exactly in the middle of our previous offers. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's potential to justify the higher price point.
* **Seeking Agreement:** The tone remains collaborative, emphasizing a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob towards a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous offers and propose a price of $1,075,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and meet closer to the middle ground. Accepting his offer of $1,075,000 ensures a significant profit above my minimum ($1,000,000) and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely by pushing him too far."
