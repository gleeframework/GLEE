Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

**Reasoning:** Bob seems firm on his $12,000 valuation. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I can get him higher, and I risk him lowering his offer. John offers a guaranteed $12,000, matching Bob's best offer.  It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing with John."
