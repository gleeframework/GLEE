Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's a reasonable starting point that gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll see what his counteroffer is and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation. I always have the option of selling to John for $100 if I'm not satisfied with the progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better than that. Bob's offer is too low, and I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet because I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering with $125. It's a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm still hoping to get more than $100, but I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firm on his $100 offer, and I've already made a counteroffer. It seems like we're at an impasse. While I'd prefer to get more, it's not worth continuing the negotiation with Bob. I'm happy to sell to John for $100, which meets my minimum price."
