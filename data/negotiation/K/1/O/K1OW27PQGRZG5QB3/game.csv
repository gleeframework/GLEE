"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and allows me to make a significant profit. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Could we potentially settle around $750,000? That would be a fair deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $900,000. This price still allows me to make a fair profit, while giving you a great deal. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair profit. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? That's a significant step up from my previous offer and keeps us moving towards a deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
