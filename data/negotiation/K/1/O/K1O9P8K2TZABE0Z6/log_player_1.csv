Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Aiming High:** Starting with an offer of $1,250,000 allows room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum. 
* **Urgency:**  Adding a time constraint might encourage Bob to accept quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or willingness to pay. 
* If this offer is rejected, you can always counter with a lower price, moving closer to your $800,000 minimum."
