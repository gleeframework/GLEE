{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value and potential.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,200,000, making it attractive to Bob. It also leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers.
* **Message:** I frame it as a fair price, highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to accept. 

**Reasoning:**

*  This strategy aims to balance getting a decent price while remaining open to negotiation. It's likely that Bob will counteroffer, and I can then adjust my price based on his counter.  
*  If Bob rejects, I can then consider a lower counteroffer or go with John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe I can likely push him to a higher number in the next round. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested in the product and has shown a willingness to increase his offer. 
* **Goal of Maximum Profit:** My goal is to maximize my profit. While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price.
* **Selling to John as a Backup:**  I have a backup option with John, so I can afford to be more aggressive in my negotiations with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $950,000, which is a smaller decrease from my previous offer and closer to my minimum price.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and presenting my counteroffer as a compromise that benefits both of us. This approach encourages further negotiation and maintains a positive tone.

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** By decreasing my price slightly, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still pushing for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Potential for Agreement:** $950,000 is a reasonable compromise point that could be acceptable to both parties. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, signaling that I'm still willing to walk away if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts this offer, the deal is done. If he rejects, I'll need to assess whether to counteroffer again or switch to John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $935,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's settle this and finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 935000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** By decreasing my price again, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. This could increase Bob's likelihood of accepting my offer.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  $935,000 is a reasonable compromise point that is closer to my minimum than Bob's latest offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to walking away, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway between $920,000 and $935,000. I'll offer $927,500 for the product. Can you consider this compromise?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I've already made several concessions, and it seems unlikely that we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with. It's time to secure the higher value offered by John.

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob's latest offer is very close to my minimum, but I'm hesitant to keep lowering my price. It seems like further negotiation would be unproductive.
* **Guarantee of Maximum Profit:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees the best possible outcome for me. This ensures I achieve my minimum value and potentially even exceed it.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob would require more time and effort.  It's more efficient to accept John's offer and finalize the sale.

**Conclusion:**

By choosing to sell to John, I'm prioritizing the guarantee of a high price over the potential for a slightly higher price from Bob.  This decision maximizes my profit and avoids further negotiation."
