{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also leaves a buffer in case Bob rejects the offer and you need to lower the price slightly. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'm always willing to negotiate, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000 and even below his own perceived value of $12,000. Accepting it would be a significant loss for me. 

I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. If we cannot reach an agreement, I will sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000? That's still a great price for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
