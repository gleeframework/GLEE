"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $15000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $7000 for it. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,12000.0
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $7000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $12000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further negotiations.",12000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,11000.0
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $11000. This is my best compromise so far.",11000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, and I'm also trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $11000, which is $10000. I'm now offering the product to you for $10500. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further negotiations.",10500.0,Alice,7,,
