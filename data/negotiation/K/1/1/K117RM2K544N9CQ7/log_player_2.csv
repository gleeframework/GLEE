"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something that I know will be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a price that reflects its true value while also being fair for both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product is truly unique, and I know it will be worth significantly more to you in the long run. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a price that reflects the product's value and still allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.
