"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something that I know will be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a price that reflects its true value while also being fair for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and the potential return on investment.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product is truly unique, and I know it will be worth significantly more to you in the long run. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a price that reflects the product's value and still allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and the market conditions. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
