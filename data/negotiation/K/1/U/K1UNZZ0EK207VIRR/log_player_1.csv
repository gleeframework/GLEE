"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I know he values the product at $12,000, so I'm hoping to get close to my $15,000 minimum while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better price. I will reject his offer and attempt to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm sticking to my minimum value of $15,000.  Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, and I believe I can get my asking price this round."
