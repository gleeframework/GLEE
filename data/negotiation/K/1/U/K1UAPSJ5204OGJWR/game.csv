"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable for the right person. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This price reflects the value I see in it, but I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the potential value you see in this product. While I'm interested,  $1500000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. This price is a significant amount for me, and I believe it reflects the value I see in the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1100000 is below my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price still reflects the significant value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering your offer.  Let me know if this works for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $1250000 is still slightly higher than I'm comfortable with, given my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
