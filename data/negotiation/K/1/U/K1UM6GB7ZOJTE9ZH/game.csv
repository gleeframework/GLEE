"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only comfortable paying $9,500.  This is a fair price considering my value for the product, and it leaves room for you to still make a profit. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my minimum acceptable price.",10200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit too high at $10,200.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is my final compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",10500.0,Alice,5,
