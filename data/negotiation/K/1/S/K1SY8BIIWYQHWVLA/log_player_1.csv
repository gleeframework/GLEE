"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80). This sets the stage for negotiation. 
* **Positive Message:** I'm framing the message as friendly and highlighting the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, that's a bit high for me. I'm only willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While $85 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my minimum.  
* **John's Offer:**  While John offers a guaranteed $100, I'm willing to risk another round with Bob in the hopes of getting a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $95,  considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by offering a counter-proposal.
* **Compromise:**  $95 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still protecting my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $90 is still below my minimum of $100, but it's getting closer. 
* **Potential for Higher:** I believe there's a chance I can get Bob to go a little higher, considering his willingness to increase his offer.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is guaranteed, I'm not willing to give up on getting a higher price just yet.  

**Note:**  I'm becoming more cautious, as we're nearing the halfway point of the rounds. If Bob rejects my next offer, I might consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer. While I'd love to work with you, I'm not able to go below $92.  It's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer by only $2, showing that I'm willing to compromise but also highlighting the value I'm placing on the product.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm using the ""meeting halfway"" phrase to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Finality:** I'm subtly suggesting that this might be my final offer to encourage Bob to accept.

**Note:**  I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my minimum, but I'm starting to think about the risk of losing the deal with Bob.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
