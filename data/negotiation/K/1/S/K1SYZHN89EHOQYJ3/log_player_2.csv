"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice's offer of $1,100,000 saves you $400,000 compared to buying from John for $1,500,000.
* **You still get a good deal:** Even though Alice is selling for more than her value ($800,000), you are getting the product for significantly less than your value ($1,500,000)."
