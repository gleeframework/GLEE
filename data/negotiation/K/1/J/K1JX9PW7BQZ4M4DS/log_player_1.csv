"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. My hope is that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate from this starting point.  However, if he rejects, I'm prepared to counter and adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe the product is worth more. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price. I still have 9 rounds to close the deal, and I want to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,750,000, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price and my initial offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and lead us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant improvement over his initial offer. While it's still below my ideal price, I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. I'm going to accept his offer and secure a sale at a price that is still higher than my minimum acceptable value."
