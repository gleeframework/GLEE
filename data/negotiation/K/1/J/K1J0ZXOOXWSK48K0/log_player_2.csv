"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for a price of $1200000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product will generate substantial returns.  I understand you may need time to consider this, and if you decline, I have another interested buyer.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Alice is offering it at exactly that price.  Since there is no potential for saving money by accepting her offer, you might as well reject it and see if Alice will lower the price."
