"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've already acknowledged the product has. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $800,000.
