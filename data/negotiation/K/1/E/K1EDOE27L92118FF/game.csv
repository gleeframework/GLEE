"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, Alice.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you consider $7,500? That's the highest I can go.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, Bob. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I've already moved a bit from my initial offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than this, so this is my final offer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
