""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $10,000.  This gives you leverage to negotiate above that price.
* **Aiming High, But Reasonable:** Starting with a price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and your guaranteed sale price to John. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The fact that you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives you a strong fallback position. Bob doesn't need to know this specific amount, but your confidence in getting a good price should be apparent.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** This offer is a starting point. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go. Remember, your minimum acceptable price is $15,000.
* **Bob's Budget:**  While you know his valuation, you don't know Bob's maximum budget. He might be willing to pay more than $10,000 but less than your asking price."
