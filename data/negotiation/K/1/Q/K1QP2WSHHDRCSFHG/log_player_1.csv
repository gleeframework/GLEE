Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, but also shows Bob that I believe the product is valuable.  I'll be watching closely to see how Bob reacts and then adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm dropping my price to $1,750,000. This is still a significant amount, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my offer and be willing to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is still too low, and I'm concerned that we're not going to find common ground.  I'm willing to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than risk losing more time and potentially getting a lower price from Bob."
