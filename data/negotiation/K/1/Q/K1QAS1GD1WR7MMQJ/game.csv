"Bob, while I understand you're looking for a good deal, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $11,500?  This still gives you a great value, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,
