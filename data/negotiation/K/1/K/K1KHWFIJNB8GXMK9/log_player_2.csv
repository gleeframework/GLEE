"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can potentially get a better deal. The product is worth $12,000 to him and only $8,000 to Alice. There's room for negotiation to reach a price that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's closer to Alice's value but still leaves him with some savings. Offering $9,000 is a reasonable counteroffer, as it's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still provides a profit for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $12,000 and still allows Bob to save $2,500 compared to his initial value of $12,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially raising the price again is too high. Accepting her offer guarantees a good price and avoids further negotiation."
