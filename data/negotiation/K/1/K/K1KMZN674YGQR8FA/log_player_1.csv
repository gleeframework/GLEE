"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $100,000 below Bob's perceived value signals that I'm open to negotiation while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message aims for a collaborative and positive tone to encourage a productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches my absolute minimum. While I could accept and close the deal now, I still have ample rounds to negotiate. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm lowering my price by $50,000 to demonstrate willingness to negotiate.
* **Justify the Price:** I'm reiterating the product's value to remind Bob why it's priced higher than his initial offer.
* **Aim for Compromise:** This counteroffer seeks a middle ground between Bob's offer and my previous price. It leaves room for further negotiation but keeps the price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a $100,000 profit margin, which is very good.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's willingness to meet in the middle shows he's serious and this is likely a fair point to settle.
* **Time Value:** While I have more rounds, there's always a risk Bob will walk away or my alternative buyer will find another deal. Accepting now secures a good profit."
