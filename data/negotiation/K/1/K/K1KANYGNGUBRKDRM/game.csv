"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's fair considering the value of the product.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
