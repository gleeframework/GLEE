# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
