"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal, as you know the value of this product is significant. Let's start with a good starting point, and we can work from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's not a good starting point.  There's room for negotiation. Bob should reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to be fair.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. While it's a step in the right direction, Bob should continue to negotiate and aim for a lower price.  He can try a counteroffer closer to his budget, hoping to reach an agreement before needing to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000, which is a significant investment for me and a fair compromise.  Let's work towards a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
