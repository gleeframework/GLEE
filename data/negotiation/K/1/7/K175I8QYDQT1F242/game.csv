"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $7,500? That would make it much easier for me to say yes.",7500.0,Bob,4,
