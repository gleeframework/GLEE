{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, but her offer is $120.  
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering $100, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $120. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  This price is still within my budget and offers a decent discount. It's also likely to be attractive to Alice since it's more than her value of $80. 
* **Negotiation:**  I'm setting the stage for further negotiation and making it clear I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above my target price. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  I believe I can still get a lower price, especially since Alice is willing to negotiate.
* **Avoiding Jhon's offer:**  Buying from John is still my last resort, and I want to avoid that if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to the middle:**  My counteroffer of $110 is a compromise,  halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Alice's current offer of $130. 
* **Demonstrating willingness to negotiate:** This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying but also want a fair price.
* **Maintaining pressure:** By continuing to make counteroffers, I'm putting pressure on Alice to lower her price to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  $140 is significantly more than what I'm willing to pay. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  While it's getting close to my upper limit, I believe there's still room for Alice to come down. I want to avoid buying from John if possible.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  By rejecting Alice's offer, I'm showing her I'm determined to get a better price and hoping she'll make a more reasonable offer in the next round."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering $120, which is right in the middle of my previous offer of $110 and Alice's current offer of $140. 
* **Showing willingness to compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm open to finding a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Closing the gap:**  With only 4 rounds left, I need to start closing the gap between our offers to reach a deal."
