"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm looking to sell it to you for $12000. I believe this price reflects its exceptional quality and the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm a bit hesitant to pay the full $12000. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe the product is valuable, but I'm not convinced it's worth the full price you're asking. Can we meet in the middle at $10000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not convinced that $11000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $11000, which would be $10500. Can we agree on that price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $11000, which would be $10750. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $10750. I'm willing to pay $10500, which is the price I mentioned earlier. If you're not willing to go that low, I'm starting to consider buying from John for $12000. Can you think of a reason to make it worth my while to stick with you?",10500.0,Bob,6,
