"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11500. What do you think?"
"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to be a bit more flexible. I can offer it to you for $12250. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",12250.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $12250 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? It's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand that $10500 is still a bit low for me, but I want to keep the negotiation going. I can offer it to you for $12000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to go. It's the minimum I need to make a profit."
"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to make one final offer. I can sell it to you for $12000, but I have to say that I'm getting a bit impatient. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,,
