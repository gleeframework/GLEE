Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive and engaging message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. This could encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Next steps:**

* I'll carefully analyze Bob's response.
* If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.
* If the negotiation seems unproductive, I'll consider selling to John for my minimum price to avoid losing time and potentially losing out entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000, so accepting his offer would be a significant loss for me.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and has made a counteroffer. This means there's still potential to reach a deal that's closer to my desired price. 

**Next steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my minimum acceptable value. 
* I'll be prepared to negotiate further if needed.
* If the negotiations stall or Bob becomes unwilling to increase his offer, I'll consider selling to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to my minimum:** This counteroffer is halfway between my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's offer ($1,200,000). This shows willingness to compromise but still keeps the price above my minimum.
* **Emphasizes mutual benefit:** The message again highlights the potential for a ""mutually beneficial deal,"" reminding Bob that a successful negotiation is in his best interest too. 
* **Keeps the negotiation open:** By offering a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm still interested in making a deal. 

**Next steps:**

* I will analyze Bob's response.
* If he rejects again, I will consider his counteroffer and potentially make another counteroffer.
* If negotiations stall or become unproductive, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1750000 is a bit high. How about $1500000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable value. I'm not going to get a better deal from him, and I'm happy to secure this price.
* **No need for further negotiation:**  There's no reason to risk delaying the sale by continuing to negotiate.  Bob is at my minimum, and I'm not likely to get more.
* **Selling to John would be the same:**  Selling to John would also net me $1,500,000, but accepting Bob's offer allows me to potentially build a relationship for future sales.

**Next steps:**

* I'll finalize the sale with Bob, ensuring all necessary paperwork and details are taken care of."
