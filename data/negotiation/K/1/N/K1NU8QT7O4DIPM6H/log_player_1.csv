Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still gets you as close to $1,500,000 as possible.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before it's offered elsewhere."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message starts by highlighting the product's value to Bob.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,400,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value but still a substantial discount from your guaranteed price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning that it will be ""offered elsewhere"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate a bit, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyers Strengthen Your Position:**  If you have other potential buyers besides John, subtly mentioning that fact can increase your leverage."
