Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95.  I believe it's worth even more, but I want to give you a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $100, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $95 leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John provides a safety net. You can confidently aim higher with Bob."
