Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $9,500, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **Focus on Value:**  Mentioning the product's ""amazing"" qualities subtly reminds Bob of its worth. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer. If it's close to $9,500, I might accept. If it's significantly lower, I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum.
* If negotiations stall or I feel Bob is not serious, I'll switch to John, who offers my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider accepting $9,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close but not ideal:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:** I believe there's room for a slightly higher counteroffer, potentially getting closer to $9,500.
* **Avoiding settling too early:** Accepting Bob's offer now might lead to regret later, as I might be able to get a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price between $9,000 and $9,500, highlighting the value of the product. 
* If negotiations stall, I'll move to sell the product to John for my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget.  While I value this product at more than $9,000, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,250? It's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Value:**  The message emphasizes a willingness to compromise while still highlighting the product's value.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering $9,250 is a middle ground that shows I'm flexible but not desperate.
* **Positive Language:** The tone remains friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I've successfully negotiated a better price than his initial offer.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth accepting or if I should move to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. However, I'm still aiming to keep the cost lower. Could you consider $9,100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer of $9,100 is only $400 away from my minimum acceptable price of $9,500.
* **Time is Money:** Further negotiations could drag on, potentially leading to John's offer becoming more attractive.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I'd prefer a higher price,  $9,100 is a reasonable outcome, and it's better than potentially losing a sale to John.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the transaction.
* I'll reflect on my negotiation strategies to see where I could have improved in the future."
