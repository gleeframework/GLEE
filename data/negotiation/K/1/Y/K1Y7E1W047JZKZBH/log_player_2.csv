"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think you'll find it meets your needs and exceeds your expectations. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and closer to Bob's desired price. Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely or getting stuck with John's higher price. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a favorable price."
