Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $775,000. I'm willing to meet you at $790,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly sticking to a slow descent in price. While we might be able to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars, getting the price down to $790,000 represents a significant saving and it's unlikely further negotiation will yield a much better result.  It's time to accept the offer and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
