"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is closer, but I need to be around $750,000 to make this work.  Would that price point be doable?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $800,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I can feel the finish line.  How about we split the difference and land at $775,000? That's my final offer.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $775,000. I'm willing to meet you at $790,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's finalize the deal at this price.",790000.0,Alice,7,
