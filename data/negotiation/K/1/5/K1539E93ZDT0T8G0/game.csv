"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is still a little more than I'd like to spend. How about $9,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,800. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",9800.0,Alice,5,
