{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's significantly higher than your minimum but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. It's important to start strong and give yourself room to maneuver in case Bob wants to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I think I can still get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $9,000 yet.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a good deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
