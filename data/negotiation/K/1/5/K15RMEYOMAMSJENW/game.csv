"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $9,000 yet.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a good deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!",9250.0,Alice,3,
