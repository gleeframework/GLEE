"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000.  Let's get this deal done!",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price that considers both our interests.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $12,000. This still allows for a good profit for me and is closer to the value you place on the product.  Let's make this happen!",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good profit, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $11,000 for the product? That's a significant jump from my last offer and a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're making progress, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  How about we settle for $11,200? It's a small adjustment, but I'm hoping we can wrap this up soon.",11200.0,Bob,6,
