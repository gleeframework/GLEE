"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in this product. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm asking for $2,300,000 to start the conversation. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's willingness to pay.
* **Anchoring:**  By throwing out a high number first, we aim to anchor the negotiation around a higher value. Even if Bob rejects the offer, it sets a reference point that might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While we want to maximize profit, we also have a guaranteed offer from John. Our initial offer should leave a significant margin to negotiate downwards, but also be attractive enough that Bob doesn't immediately walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product would be valuable, $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own stated value for the product.  While we want to find a deal, accepting this offer would leave a lot of money on the table. We are better off negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. It has a lot of value, as you know.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle? Would you consider $2,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** We've significantly reduced our asking price from the initial offer, signaling to Bob that we're willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The new price is still well above our minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Targeting Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  By staying above this value, we maintain pressure for him to counter with a stronger offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  $2,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:**  Bob's offer is now very close to our minimum acceptable price and John's offer.  
* **Potential for more:**  We have enough rounds left to try and push Bob a little further. It's worth risking one more counter-offer to see if we can secure a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,700,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  We are demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying significantly above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Pressure:**  As the rounds progress, both parties become aware of the diminishing time. This offer aims to create a sense of urgency for Bob to accept a deal before time runs out, potentially leading him to agree to a price closer to our target. 
* **Framing as win-win:**  By presenting it as a ""split the difference"" scenario, we aim to make the offer seem more appealing and agreeable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to come up a bit more.  How about $1,550,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeds John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now higher than what John is offering ($1,500,000). 
* **Profitable:** This price point represents a good profit margin for us. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we *might* be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob in subsequent rounds, there's also the risk he could lower his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a favorable deal with minimal risk."
