Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

```
Reason: $110 is a reasonable price, and further haggling might not yield a significantly better deal. It's better to accept now and secure the product for a price well below my $150 limit.
