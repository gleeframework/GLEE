"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make at least $9,000 on this sale. How about we settle on $9,500? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this deal happen!",9500.0,Alice,3,
