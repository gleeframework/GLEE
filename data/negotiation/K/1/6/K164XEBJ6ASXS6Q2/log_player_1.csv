Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Can you consider that price?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll make another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,750 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference again - how about $8,875? This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit lower. How about $8750 again?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob keeps coming back to $8,750, and I'm not willing to go that low.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with.  It's time to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
