"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Can you consider that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $8500. Can you consider $8750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8750 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference again - how about $8875? This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product for both of us.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit lower. How about $8750 again?",8750.0,Bob,6,
