{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. $175 is way above his budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price, so he's starting with his maximum budget of $80. This is a bold move, but it establishes Bob's desired price range and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $160 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget and what he can get from John. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product. $90 is still within his budget, but it's a significant increase from his previous offer, showing willingness to compromise. This should encourage Alice to consider a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $155 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above what he can get from John. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  The remaining rounds are limited, so he needs to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now pushing closer to Alice's offer. This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise, but still leaves room for negotiation. By increasing the offer, Bob is trying to gauge Alice's willingness to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, and with only three rounds left, the chances of getting a lower price are slim. Since Bob has a guaranteed option with John, he should take the safe bet and buy from John for $80. This secures the product at his maximum price point and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially end with no deal."
