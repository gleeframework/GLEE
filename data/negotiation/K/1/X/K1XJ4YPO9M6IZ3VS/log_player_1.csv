Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a strong starting point, aiming to get the best possible price. I'm confident in the value of the product and willing to negotiate from this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a good price, I believe I can do better. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $975,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway while still securing a price closer to my initial goal.  I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, $960,000 is a good deal and significantly higher than the $800,000 I'd get from John. It's time to finalize the sale."
