"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work.  Let's find a compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $900,000. While that's still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. I believe that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still significantly below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $850,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate you working with me.  How about $800,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",800000.0,Bob,6,
