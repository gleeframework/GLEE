I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $75 is below my minimum. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $81.  This price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it."", ""product_price"": 81}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $81 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $79 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, the offer of $79 is still below my minimum. It's a close call, but I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. This guarantees me my minimum price and saves me from further negotiation."
