You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to negotiate and see if you can get a better price before committing to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price that's still within my budget but allows for some wiggle room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get it lower. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, showing that I'm serious about buying the product, but still trying to get a good deal. This should hopefully encourage Alice to come down a bit further in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $135, which is a good price for me.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's always the risk of her rejecting my offer again or me running out of rounds. It's better to secure this deal and save the $15 compared to buying from John."
