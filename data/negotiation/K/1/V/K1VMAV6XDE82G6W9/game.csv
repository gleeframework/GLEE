"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
