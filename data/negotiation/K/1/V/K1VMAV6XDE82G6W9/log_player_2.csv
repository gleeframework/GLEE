"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a strong counteroffer, aiming to get a significantly lower price. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  This strategy might encourage Alice to come down on her price more quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a decent price, it's still above what Bob wants to pay.  He has some room to negotiate further, so rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be reasonable but is still pushing for a lower price. Offering $12,500, a compromise between his last offer and Alice's current offer, shows good faith while keeping the negotiation moving towards his target price."
