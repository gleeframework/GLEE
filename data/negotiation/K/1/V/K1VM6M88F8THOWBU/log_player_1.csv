"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a strategic move to test the waters and see how much he is willing to pay. I'm also leaving myself some room to negotiate downwards if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my target of $15,000. I'm going to counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer. I want to see if he's willing to budge a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but $13,500 is getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $14,000, which is in the middle of our last two offers.  I hope this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge much, and we're running out of rounds.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John. It's less than what I initially hoped for, but it's still a good deal and avoids the risk of a lower offer from Bob."
