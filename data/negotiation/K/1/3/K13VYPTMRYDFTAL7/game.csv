"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer that acknowledges the product's value while working within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
