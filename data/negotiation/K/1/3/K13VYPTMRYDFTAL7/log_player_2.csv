"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $800,000 than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
