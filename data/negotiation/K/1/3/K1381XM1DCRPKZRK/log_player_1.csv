Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
