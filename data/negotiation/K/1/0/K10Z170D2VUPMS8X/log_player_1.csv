""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $925,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Negotiation Room:** This creates a potential profit range of $200,000 ($1,000,000 - $800,000).

By offering the product at $925,000, you're aiming for:

* **Maximum Profit:**  You secure a significant portion of the potential profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, still keeping you well above your minimum. 
* **Avoiding Insult:** Offering a price too close to $1,000,000 might seem like you're not willing to negotiate and could discourage Bob."
