"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's a unique item with a lot of potential value.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 for the product and Alice is offering it for the same price, there's no immediate benefit to accepting. Bob should reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice or explore other options."
