Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's a unique item with a lot of potential value.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $15,000, which is higher than my minimum value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob, making him think about its worth to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation, making Bob feel comfortable to counter-offer if he's interested.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes a moderate level of risk. If Bob values the product at less than $15,000, I risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer of $12,000. However, if Bob values the product higher, I have the potential to earn more."
