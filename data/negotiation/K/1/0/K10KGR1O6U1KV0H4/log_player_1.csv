Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. $110 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115. That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 115}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to get a good deal, but $108 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $111?  That's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 111}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I've been going back and forth with Bob for a while, and I'm not sure he's going to come up to a price I'm comfortable with. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower price."
