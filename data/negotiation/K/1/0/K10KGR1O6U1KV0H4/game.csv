"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. $110 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115. That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking $108 would be a more reasonable price for me. Can you meet me there?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to get a good deal, but $108 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $111?  That's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",111.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced $111 is the best price for me. How about we try $106? That's a bit closer to what I'm looking for.,106.0,Bob,6,
