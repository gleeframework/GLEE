Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming to get more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has room to counteroffer, allowing for a potential compromise. 
* **It reflects the value to Bob:**  $13,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value of $15,000 than your minimum, increasing the likelihood of a deal.

**Important Note:**  This is just a starting point. You'll need to adapt your strategy based on Bob's responses and the potential deal with John."
