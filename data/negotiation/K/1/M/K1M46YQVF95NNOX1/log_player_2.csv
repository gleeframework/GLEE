Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

At this point, Alice has indicated this is her lowest price.  Continuing to negotiate risks her walking away or not moving much further. Accepting the $1,025,000 offer secures a significant saving compared to John's price."
