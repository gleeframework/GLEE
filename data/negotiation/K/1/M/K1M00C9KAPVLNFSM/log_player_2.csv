"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?"",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone is important to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Target in Mind:**  While my maximum budget is $1,500,000, I want to aim lower to secure the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I believe $1,200,000 is a fair compromise.  Does that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has come down in her offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for Maneuvering:** There's still a significant gap between her offer ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,500,000), meaning there's potential for further negotiation.
* **Target Price:** I can likely still get a price closer to my target by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand the value of the product, Alice. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,100,000?"", 
 ""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still moving towards a more favorable price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** It puts me below my maximum budget but leaves some room for a final concession if needed.
* **Time Consideration:**  I want to try to close the deal soon, and a compromise offer might encourage Alice to agree."
