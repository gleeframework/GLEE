Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its value. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for a profit and this price allows for that.
* **It's lower than Bob's estimated value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate, making him more likely to accept.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can potentially raise the price further if Bob counteroffers. 

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers aren't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. That's the price you mentioned it's worth to you, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it doesn't leave you any profit margin.  There's still potential for a higher price with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This gives you a great deal, and ensures I can still make a profit."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're not simply accepting his price.
* **Counteroffer is lower than your initial offer:** This demonstrates willingness to compromise.
* **Counteroffer is a fair compromise:** Splitting the difference gives Bob a good deal, while still ensuring a profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,300,000. How about $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than your minimum acceptable price, allowing you to make a profit. While it's lower than your ideal price, you risk losing the deal altogether if you counteroffer again.  At this point, it's better to accept and secure the sale."
