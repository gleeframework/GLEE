"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,350,000.  This is still a good price for you, and it's the most I can afford at the moment.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,350,000 is a good price, it's just a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for the product. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,400,000?  That way, we both walk away happy with the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price:** $1,400,000 is only $50,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer.
* **John's offer is significantly higher:** $1,500,000 would be a much worse deal for Bob.
* **There's a chance Alice might not budge further:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely.

While Bob could try to get a slightly lower price, accepting this offer is the most pragmatic choice, securing the product at a reasonable price without risking a better deal falling through."
