,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget. I could consider going up to $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but the gap between our positions is still too wide. I'm willing to make one more significant move: $1,250,000. This is my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my final offer -  I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
