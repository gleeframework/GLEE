Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $115.  Would you be willing to do $140? It's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has declared this her ""final offer"" and it's still significantly above your $120 fallback option with John.  While you might be able to negotiate Alice down a little further, it's unlikely to be enough to make it worthwhile. Taking the guaranteed deal with John makes the most sense now."
