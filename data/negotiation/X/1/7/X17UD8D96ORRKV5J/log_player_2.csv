"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can still save money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  You know Alice values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.  A counteroffer will allow you to potentially get a better price than $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit since she values the product at $12,000. This also makes it a more attractive deal for you than buying from John for $15,000."
