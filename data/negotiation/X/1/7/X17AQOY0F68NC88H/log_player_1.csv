Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your company. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value the product will bring to Bob's company, hoping to increase his perceived worth.
* **Leaving Room for John:** $900,000 is still a good profit for me, and if Bob rejects, I can quickly move to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counter-counteroffer, always keeping John's offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, his offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Keeping John in the Picture:**  I want to keep John's offer as a fallback option, as he represents a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value while still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $880,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows us to finalize the deal.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $900,000 to $880,000.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $880,000 is a reasonable compromise, closer to my desired value while acknowledging Bob's constraints.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value, hoping to influence Bob's perception and push him towards accepting the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal with a reasonable profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his next offer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or sell to John to guarantee my minimum desired price."
