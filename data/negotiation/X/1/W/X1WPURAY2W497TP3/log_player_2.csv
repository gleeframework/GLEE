Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $725,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the last offer, so I'll propose $775,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.

Alice is unlikely to go below $775,000 and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, which is only slightly higher. It's the safer and more economical choice at this point."
