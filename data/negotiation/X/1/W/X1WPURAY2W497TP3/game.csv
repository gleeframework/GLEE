"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a price that I think is a great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little ways off.  Would you consider $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $725,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the last offer, so I'll propose $775,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",775000.0,Alice,5,
