Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob will pay more than that.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 is a good starting point. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100), but it leaves room for negotiation if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to Bob, increasing the chances of a successful sale."
