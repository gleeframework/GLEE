"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $8,750?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to sell it for $9,000, which is a good compromise.  Let's try to close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $9,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $8,250, which is closer to what I'm comfortable with. Can we meet in the middle again?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $8,250 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,625?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think.",8625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,625. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",8000.0,Bob,6,
