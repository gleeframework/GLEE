"Alice,  $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $1,250,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can agree.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
