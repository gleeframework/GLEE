"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. It's valued at $12,000 to us due to its unique features and high-quality craftsmanship. Given its worth to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects its value to you, which we estimate to be around $8,000. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both parties. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000 and the price John offers ($8,000). By rejecting this offer, you open the door for further negotiation with Alice or can proceed to buy from John at a more favorable price."
