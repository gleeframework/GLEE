Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,150,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you get a price significantly higher than his perceived value. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price without revealing specifics that Bob could use in a counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have a strong position knowing your minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000."
