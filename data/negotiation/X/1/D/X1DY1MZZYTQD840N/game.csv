"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $11,000 is tempting, I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'd be willing to do $11,200 to finalize the deal today.  What do you say?",11200.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob,  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,350. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal today. Let me know if you're happy with that.",11350.0,Alice,7,
