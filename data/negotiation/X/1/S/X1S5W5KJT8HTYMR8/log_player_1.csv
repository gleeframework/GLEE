"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, I'm aiming for a significant profit but also keeping in mind that Bob may be hesitant to pay a price much higher than his own valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a profit that is more than what I'd get from John. I'm hoping this compromise will incentivize Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000 unless I have no other option.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm making a significant concession this round.  I'm hoping that demonstrating a willingness to negotiate will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price.  While $1,200,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but we're getting closer.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little higher.  While John is a guaranteed sale, I'm not willing to give up on getting a better price from Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm making a small concession this round, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum.  We're in the later rounds, and I want to see if I can squeeze out just a little bit more from Bob before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are still not meeting my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing out entirely. John's offer is a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is more than what I would make with Bob at this point. It's time to secure the sale and move on."
