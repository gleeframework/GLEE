"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,150,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value and the time we've spent discussing it. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get Alice down to my target of $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my initial asking price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $1,100,000, which is closer to my budget, but it still exceeds my target.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential savings.  John is offering a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, which is the best deal I can get right now.  I'll go with John to ensure I stay within my budget and avoid the uncertainty of more negotiation."
