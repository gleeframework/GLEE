"Bob, it's great to connect with you about this. This product represents a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident it can bring significant value to your operations.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, I'm looking to make a more significant discount. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is $1,000,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I'm confident in its potential to exceed even your expectations. Let's find a middle ground - how about we settle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,025,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $1,100,000 for this product. I'm confident it will more than prove its worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
