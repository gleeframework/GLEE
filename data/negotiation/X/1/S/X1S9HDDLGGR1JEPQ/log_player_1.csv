Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, I'm looking to make a more significant discount. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could push Bob further, it's unlikely he'll go much higher than $1,050,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit ($50,000) and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds. It's always possible he might have gone higher, but there's also the chance he holds firm, and we lose the deal. This feels like the right balance of risk and reward at this stage."
