"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident you'll see its worth."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and while there's room for negotiation, taking such a low offer in Round 2 would be a mistake.  I'll try to steer him higher.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter.  I understand your perspective, but $10,000 undervalues the product significantly. It's worth considerably more based on its features and what it can do for you. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While the product has great features, $18,000 is still beyond my budget. I could consider a price closer to $12,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is slowly moving in the right direction, and we're getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000, but I should counter offer to show flexibility.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still quite a bit below what I had in mind. To be fair, I could go down to $16,000. That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a significant gap from what I can afford.  I can offer $13,000, and that's pushing my budget. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tough choice. Bob is clearly trying to stay under my minimum, but $13,000 is getting close.  It's a gamble to push further. 

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I could potentially squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's not worth the risk of him walking away. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
