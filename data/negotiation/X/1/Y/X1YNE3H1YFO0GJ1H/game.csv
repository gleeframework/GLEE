"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in your product. However, $9500 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $8500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm confident the product's value to you justifies a slightly higher price. How about $9000? This would still represent a significant savings for you compared to its true worth.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9000 is still a bit high for me. How about $8750? This would give you a fair profit, and save me some money.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
