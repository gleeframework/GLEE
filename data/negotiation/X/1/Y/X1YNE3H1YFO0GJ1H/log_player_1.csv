Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in your product. However, $9500 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $8500. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm confident the product's value to you justifies a slightly higher price. How about $9,000? This would still represent a significant savings for you compared to its true worth."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9000 is still a bit high for me. How about $8750? This would give you a fair profit, and save me some money.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $8,750 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
