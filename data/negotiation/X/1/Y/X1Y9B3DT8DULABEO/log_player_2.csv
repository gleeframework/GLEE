Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $925,000 is still out of my range. Let's split the difference and settle on $875,000. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, splitting the difference is a fair approach.  How about we settle at $900,000? This reflects a compromise we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a lower price than previous rounds, it's still above the target of $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down further.  Rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
