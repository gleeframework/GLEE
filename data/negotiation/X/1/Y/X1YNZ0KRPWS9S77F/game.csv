"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $10,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $17,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you consider something closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're getting closer.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I understand your constraints.  Would you be willing to meet at $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting closer to what I can afford.  How about $13,000?  That's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,6,
