"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $110 for your product. Let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counter with an offer of $115. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $115. How about we split the difference and go with $120?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think it would make us both happy. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,5,
