"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That way we both get a good deal.",105.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider that?,95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $100.  That's fair for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
