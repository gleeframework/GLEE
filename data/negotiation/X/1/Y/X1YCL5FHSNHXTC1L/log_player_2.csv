Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and understanding that there's a gap between our valuations.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to move significantly from my initial ask. How about we consider $1,200,000?  I believe this reflects the true worth of the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm aiming for a deal that works for both of us.  To demonstrate my willingness to find a compromise, I'd be willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated that $1,000,000 is her final offer.  This is above your maximum price and you have a reliable alternative with John at $800,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
