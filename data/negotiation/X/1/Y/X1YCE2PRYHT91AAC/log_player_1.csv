"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how flexible he is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer but still remaining above my minimum acceptable value. This shows flexibility while still ensuring a profitable sale for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal value.  I'm going to continue negotiating, aiming for a higher price.  The longer I negotiate with Bob, the less likely he is to walk away, potentially leading to a better deal for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to try to encourage Bob to accept.  I'm still comfortably above my minimum acceptable value and believe there's a good chance of a deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is tempting, I'm still within my negotiation window and haven't reached my minimum acceptable value. It's worth continuing to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm making a small concession, lowering the price to $1,150,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still maintains a solid profit margin for me.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiation is getting very close to my minimum acceptable value.  However, the risk of Bob not accepting my next offer and ending the negotiation without a deal is too high. I'm going to secure the sale to John, as it guarantees me my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000."
