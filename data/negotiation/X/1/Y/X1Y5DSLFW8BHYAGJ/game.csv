"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1200000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1000000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1100000. I'm still a bit high.  How about $1050000? That's a good middle ground, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'll counteroffer at $1080000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $1080000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go to $1060000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this is a good deal for you, too.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'll meet you halfway between $1060000 and $1080000, which is $1070000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to stand by it. What do you say?",1070000.0,Alice,7,
