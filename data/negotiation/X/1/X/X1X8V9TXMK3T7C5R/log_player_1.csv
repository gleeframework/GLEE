Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Offering slightly below her guaranteed price with John creates a strong incentive for Bob.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. It signals that Alice is serious but also willing to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential return on investment,"" appealing to Bob's potential gain and justifying the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While $800,000 is Bob's perceived value, he might be willing to pay more if convinced of the product's benefits.
* **Market Knowledge:** This strategy assumes Alice has a good understanding of the market and that Bob is unlikely to find a better deal elsewhere."
