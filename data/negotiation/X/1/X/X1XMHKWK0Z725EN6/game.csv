"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to close the deal. It's still a great price for a product worth $10,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $8,250. However, I can do better than that. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,4,
