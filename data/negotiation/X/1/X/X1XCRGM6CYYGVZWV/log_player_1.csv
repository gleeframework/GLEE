Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Starting High:**  A higher initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also anchors the perceived value of the product in his mind.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies high demand and value by mentioning other interest. This can make Bob more inclined to accept the offer before he ""misses out."" 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob's personality and negotiation style, you might adjust your approach."
