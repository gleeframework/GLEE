"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start making counteroffers and try to get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, given its potential.  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still aiming to save more. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a fair profit for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to my price. How about we settle on $1,125,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,125,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping to save more. I'm not convinced it's her final offer, and I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to see if I can get it lower. I'm also taking into consideration that the deal with John is always an option."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the true value of the product while ensuring a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
