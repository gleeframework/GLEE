"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe this price reflects its exceptional quality and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $500000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While $1200000 is closer to my budget, I still feel there might be room for further negotiation. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. I hope this suggestion will allow us to come to an agreement that respects both our positions.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1050000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can agree on this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
