{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This should hopefully encourage him to counter-offer, giving me the chance to get closer to my goal of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Can we negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $120. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 120} 
``` 
I'm aiming for a middle ground by offering $120.  This should show Bob I'm willing to compromise, while still getting closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $110 as the price for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is getting closer to my goal, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $110 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $115. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I truly believe this is a great deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

This is my last counteroffer. I'm aiming for a price that's close to my minimum, hoping Bob will accept. If he doesn't, I'll sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. Considering the value of the product, I am willing to pay $110 for it. I hope this offer aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has stuck to his price of $110. Although it's a respectable amount, it's still below my minimum. I've reached my limit for negotiation.  To ensure I get at least my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John for $150."
