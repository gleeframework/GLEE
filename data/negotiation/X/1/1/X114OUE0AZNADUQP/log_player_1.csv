"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, as it is to me. I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. It's a fair offer considering the value we both see in this. Let's discuss it."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product. This reflects the value I see in it, and I'm confident it's a fair offer considering your asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too far off. It's better to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, acknowledging the value you see in this product. It's still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is getting closer, but still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I think it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and we seem to be at a stalemate. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and avoids further back and forth. While I could technically sell to John for the same price, accepting Bob's offer gives me the satisfaction of a successful negotiation."
