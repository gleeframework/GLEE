"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset with great potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm emphasizing the value and potential of the product to make my price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with an invitation to discuss, making it clear I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial price.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Time Limit:** With 10 rounds, I have some room to maneuver but need to be efficient. 
* **John's Offer:** The $1,000,000 offer from John is my safety net. I can always walk away if negotiations with Bob become too difficult. 
* **Bob's Counteroffer:** I need to be prepared to analyze Bob's counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or counter-counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Space:** I'm not desperate to sell, and I still have 8 rounds to find a better price. There's room to counter and potentially reach a higher offer.
* **John's Safety Net:**  I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, which is a more attractive option than accepting Bob's offer at this point.

**Next Step:**

I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming to bridge the gap and secure a price closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This reflects my willingness to reach an agreement, but I also need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about finding a solution.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm still highlighting the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Fair Price:** I'm framing $1,100,000 as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Balance:** I'm trying to balance getting a good price with not losing Bob completely. 
* **Time:** I still have 7 rounds, so I can afford to be a bit more flexible without rushing into a deal. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping in mind that I have a backup option with John, which helps me be assertive in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $950,000 is still significantly below my desired profit margin.
* **Negotiation Space:**  We're closing the gap, but I have 6 rounds left to potentially get a better price. I'm not in a rush to settle.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 remains a more attractive option than accepting Bob's current offer.

**Next Step:**

I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000, but remaining flexible as the negotiations progress."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll see it as a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By offering $1,050,000, I'm showing willingness to compromise. This is halfway between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000.
* **Compromise Emphasis:**  I'm explicitly mentioning this is a ""significant compromise"" to make it clear that I'm making an effort to find common ground.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Closing the Gap:** This offer is getting closer to my minimum and is potentially a good point to close the deal if Bob is reasonable.
* **Time Pressure:** With 5 rounds remaining, I need to keep the negotiations moving forward to avoid running out of time.
* **John's Offer:**  While I could still sell to John for $1,000,000, I'm hoping to find a deal with Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product, which is a bit closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $980,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Negotiation Space:**  We are very close to a deal, but I have 4 rounds left to potentially push for a slightly higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is still a more attractive option than accepting Bob's current offer, considering the small difference in price.

**Next Step:**

I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000 but remaining flexible as the negotiations progress. Since we're very close to a deal, I'll need to carefully assess the risk of losing the deal completely if I push too hard."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see that we're very close to an agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $1,020,000, which is just a small step away from your offer.  This reflects my commitment to closing this deal, but I still need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1020000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** By offering $1,020,000, I'm showing a willingness to compromise just a bit more, while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Closing the Gap:** This offer is very close to Bob's, creating a strong sense of urgency and potential for a deal.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I reiterate the need for a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to accept.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** This is a calculated risk, as it's very close to my minimum.  However, I'm hoping the small difference will incentivize Bob to accept.
* **Limited Time:** With only 3 rounds left, I need to make a decisive move.
* **John's Offer:**  While I could still sell to John, I'm confident that a deal with Bob is within reach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,020,000. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product, which is a bit closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $990,000 is very close to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Limited Time:**  With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is high. 
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a more attractive option, as it guarantees my minimum desired price.

**Conclusion:**

Given the limited time and the fact that I'm very close to my minimum, it's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. This minimizes the risk of losing out entirely."
