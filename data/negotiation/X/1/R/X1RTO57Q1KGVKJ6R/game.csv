"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm offering you the product for $850,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think that's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not at a price I can accept.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm offering you the product for $750,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a significant value for your investment. What do you say?",750000.0,Alice,5,
