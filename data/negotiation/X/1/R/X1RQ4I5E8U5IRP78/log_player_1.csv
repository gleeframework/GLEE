Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives Bob room to negotiate. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer based on his offer and how valuable the product is to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to accept that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counter-offering at $1,250,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a more realistic price point given Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping this will show him I'm serious about selling, but I'm also not willing to give away the product for a pittance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but he is getting closer. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counter-offering at $1,100,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still getting a decent profit. I think this is a fair price, and I hope Bob will finally accept. If he rejects again, I'm seriously considering selling to John at $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still unwilling to meet my price. While I'm close to a satisfactory profit, I'm tired of the back and forth. Selling to John at $1,200,000 guarantees a good deal, and I can avoid further negotiations."
