Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're getting more than your $120 floor.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  You leave room for negotiation and potentially reach a price closer to $150.
* **It's not too aggressive:** It shows you're open to negotiation, but you're not giving away the product for cheap.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still above your minimum, you can likely do better. There's room to negotiate further, and you could potentially get closer to your desired price point.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and try to push the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```

This counteroffer attempts to:

* **Meet Bob halfway:** It shows you're willing to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Stay above your minimum:**  It keeps the price above your floor of $120.
* **Signal your willingness to negotiate:** It shows that you're open to discussion and finding a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $132.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer.  

Here's why:

* **Close to your desired price:** $130 is only $10 away from your initial offer and only $2.50 less than your counteroffer.
* **Avoid risk:** There's no guarantee you'll get a better offer from Bob in the next round.
* **Time efficiency:** Accepting now saves time and effort in further negotiation. 

While you might be able to squeeze out another dollar or two, the risk of Bob walking away or you having to settle with John at $120 outweighs the potential benefit of further negotiation."
