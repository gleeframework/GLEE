Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value to me. Let's work together to make this happen.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,125,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm happy to go to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This gives you a good return and allows us to close this deal.  Let's try to find common ground.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to go to $1,090,000. This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to come away happy. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both show flexibility. Let's make this happen!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,090,000 is getting closer, we're still not at a point where I'm comfortable closing the deal. I'll make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but I'm still a little too far away from where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm ready to pay $1,080,000. This price is a fair reflection of the value to me, and it allows us to finally close this deal.  Let's reach a final agreement and move forward! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is still too far below my desired price, and I only have a couple of rounds left. It's better to sell to John for $1,500,000 and ensure a substantial profit."
