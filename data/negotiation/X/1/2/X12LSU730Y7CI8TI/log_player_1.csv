Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll make a relatively high offer to see if he's interested.

{""product_price"": 900,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still a significant amount. Since I'm not desperate to sell, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $750,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. I'll try to gauge Bob's willingness to pay and see if I can get closer to my initial offer.

{""product_price"": 850,000}"
