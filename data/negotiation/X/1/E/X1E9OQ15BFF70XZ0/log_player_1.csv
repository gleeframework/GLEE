{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price given the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This incentivizes Bob to negotiate, as he sees the potential for a good deal. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a reasonable price:**  It's not an unreasonable price, so Bob is likely to take your offer seriously.

Remember, this is just the first offer. You will need to be flexible and adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,250,000. I am willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price.  I believe I can still reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob, and I don't want to risk selling to John for less than my desired amount just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.

Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to increase my offer to $1,125,000. This amount is higher than my initial offer and represents the maximum I am comfortable spending on the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I believe there's still potential to reach a price closer to my target.  I'm going to counter with a price slightly higher than his offer and see if we can find common ground.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm confident I can get closer to my goal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,125,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a final price of $1,137,500. This compromise should work for both of us. If you're not able to accept this price, I'll have to consider selling to John."", ""product_price"": 1137500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've done my best to accommodate your needs while staying within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,130,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope it aligns with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get a price closer to my desired $1,500,000, it seems that Bob is unwilling to budge further.  It's becoming clear that continuing to negotiate with him is unlikely to lead to a significantly better outcome.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I reach my minimum acceptable price and secure a profitable deal."
