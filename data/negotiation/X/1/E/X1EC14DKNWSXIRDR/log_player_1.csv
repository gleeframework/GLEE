Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you know the product is worth $800,000 to both of you, starting with a higher offer ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value, implying its ""value and potential"" aims to justify the higher asking price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is somewhat negotiable. If you know Bob is highly price-sensitive, you might want to start with a smaller margin above your minimum.
* **Risk Tolerance:** There's a risk Bob might outright reject the offer and go with your guaranteed $800,000 from John.  You have to weigh the potential for higher profit against this risk."
