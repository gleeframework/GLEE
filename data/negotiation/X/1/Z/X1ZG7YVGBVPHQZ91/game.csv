"Bob, I understand your position.  While I value your interest, $12,000 is significantly below what I need to make this sale worthwhile. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $13,500.  This reflects a fair price that considers both of our needs. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
