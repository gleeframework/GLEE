"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I'm hoping to get the product for a lower price. I'm willing to pay $1050000. This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1175000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.
