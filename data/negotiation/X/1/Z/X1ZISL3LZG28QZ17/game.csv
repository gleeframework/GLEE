"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth $10000 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product for less than it's worth to you, and I get a sale without having to go through the hassle of finding another buyer. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,
