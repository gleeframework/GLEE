"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a valuable asset that's worth at least that much to me, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product is valuable, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to buy it for $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $950,000.  This reflects the value of the product and still allows for a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $875,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $875,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
