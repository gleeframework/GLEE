"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $1,200,000 is too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is a significant amount, it's far below the product's true worth and my minimum acceptable price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $600,000 is simply too far below what it's worth.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this opportunity."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000. That's a significant investment and reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum price, $700,000 is still too low.  I'm confident that I can secure a better price by continuing to negotiate.  It's important to remember that I have a safety net with John, so I'm not pressured to settle for less than what the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop to $800,000, but I can't go any lower.  This price reflects the value we both see, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving on the price. I'm willing to come up to $750,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is an improvement, it's still below my desired price point and my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not pressured to sell, especially considering I can always sell to John for $1,000,000. I'm going to continue negotiating to try and secure a price closer to $800,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $750,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000.  This price is fair and allows us both to secure a valuable product.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 775000}
