"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $1,200,000 is too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $600,000 is simply too far below what it's worth.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000. That's a significant investment and reflects the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop to $800,000, but I can't go any lower.  This price reflects the value we both see, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving on the price. I'm willing to come up to $750,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $750,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000.  This price is fair and allows us both to secure a valuable product.  Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has come down significantly, and while there might be a slight chance to haggle further, the difference is getting smaller. At this point, the risk of her increasing the price or the deal falling through isn't worth the potential savings.  $775,000 is a reasonable compromise."
