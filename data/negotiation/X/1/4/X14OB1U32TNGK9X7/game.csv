"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get as close to my budget as possible. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $13,000 is my absolute minimum.  This still gives you a good price, and it's fair for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $13,000. How about we try $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
