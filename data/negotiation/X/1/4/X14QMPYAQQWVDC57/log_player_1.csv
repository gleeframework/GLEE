``` 

I'm starting with an offer slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to see some more flexibility on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a low offer. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to pay less, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,400,000?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to accept."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,300,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's latest offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk further rounds of back and forth and potentially ending up with a deal that's not in my best interest.  

Selling to John at $1,500,000 guarantees me my desired price and avoids any further negotiation."
