"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
 Alice is starting high. There's room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming lower:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation.  This also gives me a sense of her willingness to move on price.
* **Polite and interested:**  Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation amicable and increases the chances of a deal. 
* **Not too low:** While I want to save money, going too low (e.g., $80) might insult Alice and make her less willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $125 is a reasonable price, saving me $25 off John's offer and meeting Alice closer to her preferred price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might get a slightly better price, but there's also the risk Alice could increase her price or I might need to settle for John's offer anyway. 
* **Time Saved:**  Accepting now avoids further back-and-forth negotiation."
