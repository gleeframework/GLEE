Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,400,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,425,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal you won't want to miss.
