"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I am willing to offer $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,400,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,425,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal you won't want to miss.",1425000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,425,000 is an improvement, I still feel there might be room for a more favorable arrangement for both parties. I would like to propose $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair and aligns closer with your initial asking price while keeping it within my budget constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
