"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob for a bit longer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I think this price is more reasonable. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $11,800 is closer to my target price, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher number.  I'm going to make another counteroffer, but I'm also considering selling to John if I can't get a better deal from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $12,200? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can get even closer to a deal. My new counteroffer is $11,900. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,900

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $11,900 is getting close to my floor price, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher number. I'm also starting to worry that I'm going to run out of rounds and have to sell to John. I'm going to make one more counteroffer, and if Bob rejects it, I'll sell to John."
