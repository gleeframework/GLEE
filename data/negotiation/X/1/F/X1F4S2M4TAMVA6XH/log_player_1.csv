Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth at least $100, and to make this a great deal for you, I'm willing to offer it for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with a price of $120 offers a reasonable markup while still being within a potentially acceptable range for Bob, considering the product's value to him is $100. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $120, the message implies a willingness to discuss the price, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable deal slightly above your minimum."
