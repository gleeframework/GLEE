Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts high, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's also important to acknowledge that Bob is getting a good deal, which could make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to come down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $110?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $108 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite enough to make me comfortable.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120 and avoid the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
