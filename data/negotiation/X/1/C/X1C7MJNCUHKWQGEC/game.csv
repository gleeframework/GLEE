"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to come down to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $110?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",108.0,Bob,4,
