"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, while giving you a good price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
