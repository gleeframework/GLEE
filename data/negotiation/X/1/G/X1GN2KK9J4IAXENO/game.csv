"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I really like the product and think it's worth it.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,200 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference again - how about $8,750? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target. How about $8,500 was a bit too high, but I'm willing to meet you at $8,250?",8250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here.  $8,250 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that point.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",8200.0,Bob,8,
