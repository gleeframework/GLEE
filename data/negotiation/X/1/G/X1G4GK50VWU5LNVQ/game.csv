"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price.  Given my budget, I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  How about we settle on $1050000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $1050000, which would be $1075000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
