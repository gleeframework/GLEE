{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price.  Given my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  How about we settle on $1,050,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  Bob is moving slightly closer to Alice's offer, but still pushing for a lower price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $1050000, which would be $1075000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Alice's offer is just $25,000 above Bob's ideal price of $1,050,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offers:**  Rejecting the offer could lead to further negotiation, but there's a risk of Alice becoming less flexible or ultimately refusing to lower the price.
* **Time Constraint:** With only five rounds remaining, accepting this offer secures the product at a good price without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
