"I understand that you have a specific budget in mind, Bob. However, I'd like to emphasize that the product's value is substantial, and I'm not willing to go below $920000.

This is my last compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",880000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your price, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling at $860000. I'm willing to take a risk and make another counteroffer, but I need to know that you're willing to meet me at a price that's closer to the product's true value. I'm counteroffering at $900000, which is still a discount from my initial price. This is my last chance to negotiate, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,7,
