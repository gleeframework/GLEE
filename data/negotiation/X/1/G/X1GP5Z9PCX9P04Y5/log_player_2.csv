Alice's offer:

Alice is coming down, but there's still room to negotiate before hitting your $100 target or needing to consider John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob. I can do $108, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:

While you could try to push for $105, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting at $108 gets you a good deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down, forcing you to buy from John at $150."
