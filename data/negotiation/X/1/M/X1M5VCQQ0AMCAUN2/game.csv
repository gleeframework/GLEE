"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  This product has the potential to bring you a significant return, considering its worth to you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a deal that works for both of us.  I'm confident that $1,100,000 is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to close this transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  While $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, I'm confident that the product's true value justifies a slightly higher price. How about we settle on $1,150,000? This allows me to recognize its full potential while still offering you a great deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to work with me.  Let's split the difference. How about we settle on $1,125,000? This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy with the deal.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
