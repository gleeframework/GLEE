"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this incredible product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
