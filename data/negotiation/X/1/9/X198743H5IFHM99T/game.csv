"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a price closer to your initial offer, but I'm not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",900000.0,Alice,5,
