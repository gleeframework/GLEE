Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1500000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $800000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

However, I notice that selling the product to John for $1,200,000 would be a better option than risking a lower price. I'll choose to sell the product to John.
