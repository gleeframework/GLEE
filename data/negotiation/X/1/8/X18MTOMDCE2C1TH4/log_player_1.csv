Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be very beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start too low. There's always a chance he might be willing to pay more than his initial valuation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A high starting price leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can gradually come down to a price that's still significantly higher than our minimum.
* **Backup Option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John. This gives us leverage to be firm in our negotiations with Bob, knowing we have a safety net.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have limited information about Bob's negotiation style and willingness to pay.  In a real-world scenario, gathering more information about the buyer would lead to a more tailored approach."
