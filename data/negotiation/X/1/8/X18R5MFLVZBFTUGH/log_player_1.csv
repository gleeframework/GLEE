Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $150 is tempting, it's the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, it makes more sense to proceed with the sale to John. This avoids further negotiation and guarantees I receive my desired price."
