Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You know you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John. Therefore, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more than that.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob values the product even slightly above $1,000,000. He saves $50,000 compared to your backup offer, and you make a profit.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Phrasing the offer as exclusive and time-limited encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value."
