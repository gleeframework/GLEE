Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value of $120. I'm curious to see if Bob is interested in this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is higher than what John is offering.  While I'd like to see if I can get a bit closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer ensures a better outcome than selling to John."
