"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you place on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
