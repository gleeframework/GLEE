"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to be flexible to find a deal that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $950,000. This is a fair offer considering the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. Let's try to bridge this gap. How about $985,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both sides.",985000.0,Alice,5,
