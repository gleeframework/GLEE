Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is intentionally above Bob's perceived value ($10,000). While he might not pay $19,000, it sets a strong anchor point.  
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely suggests the product's value, hoping to influence Bob's perception without revealing your bottom line.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive or a tough negotiator, you might lower the initial offer slightly.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This offer is just the first step. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually decrease your price until you reach a point where it's more profitable to sell to John."
