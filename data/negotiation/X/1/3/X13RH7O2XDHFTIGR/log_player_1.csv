Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000, which is still below the value I know this product holds for you.  Let's find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
