"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good price quickly. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is more than my minimum, I believe I can still secure a higher price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round but still aiming for a price above Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility while still striving for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $12,000 is getting close to my minimum and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. Accepting now minimizes the risk of further haggling and potential loss of the deal."
