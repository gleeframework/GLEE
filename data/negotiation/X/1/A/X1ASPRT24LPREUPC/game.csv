"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is very valuable to me. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go above $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target. Let's make this happen.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000, so I'll offer $12,500. Can you consider this revised offer?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good price, and I respect that. However, $12,500 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $13,250.  This would be a fair compromise, giving us both a bit of what we want.  What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,250, so I'll offer $12,625. Can you consider this revised offer?",12625.0,Bob,6,
