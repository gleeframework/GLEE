# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $950,000 is within his budget, there's room for negotiation. He can aim for a lower price, potentially saving a significant amount."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. While $900,000 is a better price than the initial offer, it's still above his target.  He can continue negotiating and try to get a price closer to his desired range."
