"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to offer you $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the price I could get it from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $900,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that reflects its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While I could push for more, accepting $875,000 is a strong outcome. It provides a substantial profit over my minimum ($800,000) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds."
