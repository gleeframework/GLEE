Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth at least $80, but I'm willing to let it go for $95. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering it at $95, we can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, great! If he hesitates or tries to negotiate, we know there's still a chance he'll pay more than $80. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80, so there's no risk of losing money.  

**Important Note:**  This assumes we have no information about Bob's personality or negotiation style. If we knew he was particularly price-sensitive, we might offer a lower initial price."
