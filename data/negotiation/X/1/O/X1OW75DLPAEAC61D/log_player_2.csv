# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

**Explanation:**

Since you are comfortable paying $120 for the product, and John is offering it for that price, there's no need to negotiate with Alice. It's a guaranteed deal with John."
