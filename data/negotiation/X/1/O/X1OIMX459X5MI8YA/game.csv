"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $75? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",75.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $75, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $72.50? That way, we can both get a good deal.",72.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, but $72.50 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $73.50.  Let's close this deal, how about it?",73.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go up to $73.50, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $72.50 and $73.50. How about $73? That's the best I can do.",73.0,Bob,6,
