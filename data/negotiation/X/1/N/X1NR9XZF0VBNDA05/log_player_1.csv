Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product's value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's worth. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,875, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to offer $8,250, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is getting too low. While I could sell to John for $8,000, I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  It's better to keep negotiating with Bob than to sell to John and potentially lose out on a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,250 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you at $8,250, but I need to make a decision soon. Can we finalize the deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. It's getting close to the point where I'd be better off selling to John. Time is running out, and I need to make a decision. I'm going to sell to John for $8,000 to ensure I get at least something out of this negotiation."
