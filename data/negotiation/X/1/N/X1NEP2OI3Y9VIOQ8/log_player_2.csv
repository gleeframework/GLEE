Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,650.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,650 is very close to my preferred price range.  With only 3 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation and potentially getting stuck with John's higher price is too high. It's time to accept the deal and secure the product for a price that's still significantly lower than John's."
