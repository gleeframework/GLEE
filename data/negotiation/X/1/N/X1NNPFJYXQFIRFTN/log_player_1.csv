"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $1,200,000 is still outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Let's see if we can close the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is an improvement, it's still far from my desired price point.  I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a substantial offer, and I'm hopeful we can find a solution here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds with Bob in hopes of getting a better deal. It's a high-value product, and I'm not eager to settle for a lower price just yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're so close!  I understand your position, but $1,000,000 still doesn't cover my costs.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,037,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1037500}
