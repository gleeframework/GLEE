"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's try to meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $1,200,000 is still outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Let's see if we can close the gap.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a substantial offer, and I'm hopeful we can find a solution here.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're so close!  I understand your position, but $1,000,000 still doesn't cover my costs.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,037,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",1037500.0,Alice,7,
