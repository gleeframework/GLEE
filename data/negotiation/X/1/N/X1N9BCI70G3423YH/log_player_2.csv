Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $875000 is sufficient for this exceptional product. I'm willing to consider $887500. This is a compromise that's closer to my minimum price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

You should accept Alice's offer. It's now at $875,000, which is a good deal for you, and you risk losing it by continuing to negotiate.  You're only $75,000 over your desired price and it seems unlikely you'll get much lower than this.  There's no need to risk going back and forth further and potentially losing the deal."
