"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm starting at $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I want to maximize my potential profit, so I'm starting at a price close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** Keeping the communication friendly and open helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer is high enough that Bob might counter, giving us a chance to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm open to negotiation,  $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I believe there is still room for us to reach a price that's more beneficial to me. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter and hopefully secure a better deal.
* **Negotiation is key:**  I want to maximize my profit, and I'm confident that continuing the negotiation will give me a better outcome than selling to John right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, it's a bit lower than what I can accept at this time.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,750? That gives us both some room to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to be flexible while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Focusing on Mutual Benefit:**  The ""split the difference"" language emphasizes that we're both trying to find a win-win solution.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly, hoping to build rapport and encourage Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $10,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on the Deal:** Bob's offer is only $250 below my minimum acceptable price. At this point, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're already in round 4, and each round brings me closer to having to sell to John for $10,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I would prefer to get closer to my original target, accepting Bob's offer ensures I secure a sale and get a decent profit.  The risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer outweighs the potential gain from further negotiation."
