"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still represents a significant value for you, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. This is the highest I can go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
