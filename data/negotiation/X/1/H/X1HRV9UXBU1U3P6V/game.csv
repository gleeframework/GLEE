"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while allowing us both to achieve a satisfactory outcome. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $1,400,000 for the product. This price reflects its value while also allowing us to reach a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still not quite where I need to be. To make this work, I'd need to see $1,350,000. This is a small increase from your last offer, and I believe it reflects the unique value of this product. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits us both.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still slightly out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000.  This is a small increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer. To be honest, I'm surprised we haven't reached an agreement yet, considering the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $1,337,500. This is a fair compromise, and it demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work. I hope we can finally come to an agreement in this round.",1337500.0,Alice,7,
