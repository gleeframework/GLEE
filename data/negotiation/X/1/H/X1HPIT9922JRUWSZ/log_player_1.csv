Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:**  The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so he has room to negotiate.
* **My minimum:** My minimum acceptable price is $8,000, and I want to maximize my profit.
* **Initial Offer:** Offering $12,000 allows for some negotiation and keeps a good margin for me. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a relatively high offer, I aim to get Bob to counter quickly.  If his counteroffer is too low, I can use John as a ""backup"" buyer to secure at least $8,000. This approach balances maximizing profit with minimizing risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's counteroffer of $9,000 is still a bit below my desired profit margin.
* **John's Option:** Selling to John for $8,000 is my absolute minimum, and I want to do better if possible.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, as his initial willingness to pay $15,000 shows he values the product.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. This keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially secure a higher price without risking selling to John for a lower amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous Offer:** I rejected Bob's $9,000 offer, indicating my desire for a higher price.
* **Midpoint Approach:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer. 
* **Balancing Profit and Negotiation:**  It's a reasonable price that still provides me with a decent profit while acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrate my willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Keep the negotiation moving without immediately settling for a price lower than my desired range. 
* **Increase likelihood of agreement:**  By offering a price closer to Bob's, I make it more likely that he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's counteroffer of $9,500 is closer to my desired price than my previous offer.
* **John's Option:** While selling to John for $8,000 is an option, it's my absolute minimum, and I'm hoping for a better outcome.
* **Risk/Reward:** Further negotiation with Bob risks a stalemate or his withdrawal, potentially leading to the lower price from John.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale for a price that's significantly higher than my minimum and within a reasonable distance of my desired profit margin.  The risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
