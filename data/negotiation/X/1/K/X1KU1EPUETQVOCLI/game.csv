"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand your budget constraints, but considering the product's value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1500000 is still outside my budget. While I see the potential of this product, I'm only able to offer $1000000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
