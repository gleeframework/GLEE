"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering your product, but $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is my maximum.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I will reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand your budget constraints, but considering the product's value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1500000 is still outside my budget. While I see the potential of this product, I'm only able to offer $1000000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still below my minimum. It's better to secure a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than risk further negotiation and potentially get a worse outcome."
