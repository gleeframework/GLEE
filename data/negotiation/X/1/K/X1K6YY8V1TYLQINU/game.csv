"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product and would be happy to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $130 is still a bit more than I want to spend, though. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
