"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value Bob will gain by accepting the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message invites Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially counter-offer.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** While I'm aiming to get a good price from Bob, I'm aware that I have a backup option with John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that significantly undervalues my product. 
* **I have 10 rounds to reach an agreement, and I have a backup buyer in John.** This gives me room to be patient and try to secure a better price.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer in the next round, potentially pushing the price closer to my target.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer closer to Bob's price:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting the value again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, emphasizing that my offer is still a good deal for him.
* **Seeking compromise:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to further negotiation while maintaining a firm stance. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm still aware of my backup option, which gives me confidence in my negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** While we're getting closer, I'm not yet at a point where I'm willing to settle.
* **I have 6 more rounds to reach an agreement, and I have a backup buyer in John.** This gives me room to be patient and try to secure a better price.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer in the next round, potentially pushing the price closer to my target.** I'm hoping to get Bob to offer closer to $10,500."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,150. This is a very fair offer, given the product's value to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This time, I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $10,500 and Bob's offer of $9,800. This shows a clear willingness to compromise and meet him in the middle. 
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to him, making my offer even more appealing.
* **Urgency:** By saying ""Let's close this deal!"", I'm injecting a sense of urgency into the negotiation, hoping to encourage Bob to accept my offer.
* **Maintaining my minimum:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Aware of John:** I'm still mindful of my backup option with John, giving me the confidence to push for a better price while not getting stuck in a stalemate."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,900 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.** Even though we're very close, I'm not yet ready to settle. 
* **I have 4 more rounds left.** While the time is ticking, I still have some room to negotiate and try to get closer to my desired price.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer in the next round.** This will give me one more chance to push for a higher price.
* **Selling to John would be a safe option, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob.** I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can reach a deal with Bob that's more favorable."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're so close to a deal! I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This is my final offer. It's a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This time, I'm explicitly stating that this is my final offer. This creates a sense of urgency and pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Slightly below my minimum:** While this offer is slightly below my initial minimum of $10,000, it's still above Bob's latest offer.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, making it even more attractive.
* **Enthusiasm:** I'm using enthusiastic language like ""Let's make this happen!"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Awareness of Time:** I'm aware that we are getting closer to the end of the rounds and need to close this deal soon.

This offer is a strong compromise and puts the ball firmly in Bob's court.  If he rejects it, I'm ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to go down to $10,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $9,700 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are down to the last two rounds. 
* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $9,700 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and I don't think he'll budge much further.
* **John is a Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  This is a sure thing and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a better price from Bob, it's better to secure a profitable deal with John than to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
