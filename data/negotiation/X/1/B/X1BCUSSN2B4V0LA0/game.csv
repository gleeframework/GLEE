"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on your product. However, my budget allows me to pay up to $850000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. I look forward to your response.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $850000. Considering our conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product brings to the table. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still unable to meet at $875000 due to my budget constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $860000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm still not willing to go below $880000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $872500. This is a final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",872500.0,Alice,5,
