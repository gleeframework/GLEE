Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $1,200,000, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price increases the chances of a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,100,000 is still a significant profit for me (a $100,000 gain) and offers a $100,000 potential saving for Bob compared to its value to him. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning other interested buyers, I'm creating a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly."
