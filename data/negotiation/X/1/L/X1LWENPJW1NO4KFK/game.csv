"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1200000. Let me know if you're open to that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  $1400000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1300000. How about we meet at $1350000? This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value and the time we've already discussed it.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
