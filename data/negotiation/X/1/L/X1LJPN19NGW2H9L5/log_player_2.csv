"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay $120 for the product, but you want to save as much money as possible. Since you can buy the same product from John for the same price, there's no advantage to buying from Alice.  Rejecting Alice's offer leaves open the possibility of finding a better deal or negotiating a lower price with Alice in the future."
