"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

$1,200,000 is way more than your target of $800,000.  You need to counteroffer and see if you can negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you and my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

While $1,100,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your budget. You should counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to your $800,000 goal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $1,050,000 is a better offer than before, it's still above your budget. It's likely that Alice won't go lower, and you're running the risk of negotiating further and potentially losing the deal. It's more financially sound to buy from John at $800,000, as it guarantees you the product within your budget."
