Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting at $150 gives me some room to negotiate down. It also implies the product is of high value.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and consider the offer. 
* **Open-ended Question:**  Asking for Bob's thoughts allows him to express interest and potentially offer a counteroffer. 
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I'm prepared to either counter or go with John's guaranteed $120 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I am only able to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:**  Bob's offer of $120 meets my minimum selling price.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and doesn't guarantee a higher price. 
* **No Further Gains:**  There's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a better price from Bob. 

It's better to accept his offer and avoid potential delays or a worse outcome."
