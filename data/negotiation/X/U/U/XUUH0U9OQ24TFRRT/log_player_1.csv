"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also framing it as a good deal for Bob to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my budget of $80. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $90,  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and $85 is within my minimum acceptable price range.  I'd rather secure the sale than risk losing him and having to sell to John at $120."
