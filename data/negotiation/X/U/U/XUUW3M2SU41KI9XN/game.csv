,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I'm sure you'll agree that's a fair price for the value you'll get from this product.",115.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $105? This is a fair price for the value of the product, and it's the best I can do.",105.0,Alice,5,
