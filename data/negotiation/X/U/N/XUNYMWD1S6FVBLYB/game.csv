"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your offer of $8,000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
