Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your offer of $8,000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $10,000.  It's time to switch to John and secure the $10,000 price."
