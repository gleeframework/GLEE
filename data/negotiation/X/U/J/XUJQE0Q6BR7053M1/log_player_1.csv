Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $120 (John), you can afford to start with a higher price than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A price of $135 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. 

It's important to remember that this is just an opening offer.  Based on Bob's response, you might need to adjust your strategy."
