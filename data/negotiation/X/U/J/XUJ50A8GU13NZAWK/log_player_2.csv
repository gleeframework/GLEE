"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth that much to you. I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is stating the product is worth $1,200,000 to both of you, that doesn't mean it's the best possible price.  There's no room for negotiation in her offer. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of:

* **Alice lowering her price:** She might be willing to negotiate rather than lose the sale.
* **Sticking with John:** You haven't lost anything by rejecting Alice's offer, as you can still buy from John at the same price. 

Your goal is to save money, and accepting the first offer, even if it's within your budget, doesn't align with that goal."
