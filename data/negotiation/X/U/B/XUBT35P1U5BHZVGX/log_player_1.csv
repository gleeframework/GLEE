Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation (if Bob tries to counter-offer).
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and avoid missing out.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer if needed."
