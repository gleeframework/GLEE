Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find really valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering it at $100 leaves room for negotiation but still secures a significant profit for you. It's a price that's likely attractive to Bob while still being beneficial for you. 

**Why not higher?**  While Bob values it at $120, starting too high might discourage him. 

**Why not lower?** Going below $100 significantly cuts into your potential profit, especially when you have John as a backup buyer at $80."
