"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit high for you, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $775,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm still confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $775,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. Could we settle on $740,000?",740000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to meet you at $760,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you.",760000.0,Alice,5,
