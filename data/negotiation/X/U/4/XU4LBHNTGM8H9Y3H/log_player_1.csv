Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) as possible while still exceeding John's offer ($1,200,000).
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning another interested party (John) creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept the offer quickly.

This approach aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than John's offer while still being potentially attractive to Bob."
