"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $70, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm confident you'll love the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",90.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $80, which is fair for both of us. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,4,,
