Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $110. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to accept $100?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could try to push for a higher price, accepting $100 is a good outcome. It's a significant profit margin ($20), and there's always the risk that Bob might walk away if I push too hard."
