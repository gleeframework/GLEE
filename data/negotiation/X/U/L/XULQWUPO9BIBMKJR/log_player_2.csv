The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $110.  This is a good deal, but I want to see if I can get it for even less. I will counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to accept $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
