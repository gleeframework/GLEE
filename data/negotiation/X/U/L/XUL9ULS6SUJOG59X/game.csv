"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While that offer is appealing, I believe this product's true value is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I value this product, $1,200,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my financial constraints. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
