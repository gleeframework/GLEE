"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $135. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $135 is less than Alice's value of $150, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $120.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $135 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a bit more.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $125 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120. Since John is offering the same product for $120, Bob should choose to buy from John. This ensures Bob gets the product at the best possible price within his budget."
