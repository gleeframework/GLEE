"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I believe it's a fair price given its value and the opportunity it presents. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount above his desired price point of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11500, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is closer to his desired price point, it's still above his target of $10,000. He can continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of getting a better price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to continue to explore a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend at this time.  I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11000 still doesn't fully reflect the value of this product. To show my commitment to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $11250. This price is a fair compromise, allowing us both to benefit from the transaction. Let's finalize this deal, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above Bob's desired price point of $10,000.  While the negotiation is progressing, Bob is nearing his limit of 10 rounds and doesn't want to risk ending up with a price he's not happy with.  He can secure the product from John for his target price, so it's the most sensible decision at this point."
