Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1200000. However, I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1250000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more,  $1,250,000 is a good deal for me. It's significantly higher than selling to John, and it seems like Bob is serious about this price."
