{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $170. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value ($150) to give myself some room for negotiation. It's also important to be friendly and positive to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value, so I'm going to reject it. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. This still gives me a reasonable profit and is a fair price for the value you'll be getting. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm also trying to highlight the value Bob will receive to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to agree on a price closer to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer of $110 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum, it's more financially beneficial to sell the product to John at $150."
