Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John.  I have 9 rounds left, and I'm going to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. It's a fair compromise and allows us to make a deal. Let's close this now!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit. This would be a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal quickly. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is right at my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or cause Bob to walk away.  I've only got 6 rounds left, and it's a good deal for both of us.  It's time to close this deal."
