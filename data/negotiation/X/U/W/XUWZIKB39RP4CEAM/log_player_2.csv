"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are aiming to pay no more than $1,000,000, and Alice's offer is $100,000 above that.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.** By rejecting, you can start the negotiation process and try to get a lower price.
* **John's offer is a safety net.** If the negotiation with Alice fails, you can always buy from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counter:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the range of a potential deal. 
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** The message highlights how this price is good for both parties, fostering a collaborative tone.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning a quick closure creates a sense of pressure and encourages Alice to consider the offer seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. It's a fair compromise and allows us to make a deal. Let's close this now! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a step in the right direction, $1,050,000 is still $50,000 above your target price.
* **John's offer is the safest option.**  Since you are only $50,000 away from a deal with John, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice.
* **Time is a factor.** You have a limited number of rounds, and it's not clear if you can get Alice down to your desired price within the remaining rounds.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  You can make a counter-offer of $1,025,000, but be prepared to walk away if Alice doesn't accept.
* **Consider buying from John.**  Given the potential for time constraints and the small price difference, buying from John might be the most sensible choice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit. This would be a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This counteroffer clearly states your absolute limit, putting the ball in Alice's court.
* **Focus on compromise:** The message emphasizes the potential for a fair and quick closure, encouraging Alice to accept.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the need for a quick decision to close the deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Alice accepts, you achieve your goal and save $200,000 compared to her initial offer.
* If Alice rejects, you have two options:
    * **Buy from John:**  This is the safest option, as you achieve your goal of acquiring the product at your target price.
    * **Make another counteroffer:** You can try to negotiate further, but it's risky considering your limited rounds. You might consider a slightly higher offer, but be prepared to walk away if Alice doesn't budge."
