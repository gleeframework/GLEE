"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident it's a good investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value to me. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply not feasible for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,075,000?  That seems like a fair compromise to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1,112,500 for the product. This is a fair price that meets both of our needs.  What do you say?",1112500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! However,  $1,112,500 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we settle at $1,095,000? This brings us closer to a deal and keeps it within a reasonable range.",1095000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find common ground. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is a final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider selling to John.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
