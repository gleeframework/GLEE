"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This is my maximum willingness to pay for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, however, $950,000 falls significantly below my minimum threshold for this product.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? I'm confident this offer represents a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand your position, I must stick to my budget. I am unable to meet the price of $1,050,000. However, I am willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. I hope we can find a way to move forward with this transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
