"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let you have it for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than both your maximum price ($100) and what John offers ($100).  It's highly likely you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often involve starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This leaves room for bargaining.
* **Significantly Below Value:** Offering $80 is considerably lower than Alice's valuation ($120), but it's important to gauge her reaction and see if she's willing to come down significantly. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you have John's offer of $100 as a backup, so you have some leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down in price, $125 is still above both your maximum budget and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate and moves closer to a potential agreement. 
* **Staying Below John:**  The offer is still below John's $100 price, keeping that option open.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help you gauge how much further Alice is willing to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we meet at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling that she's unwilling to go much lower.  Her latest offer of $110 is still above your $100 limit and John's offer. It's unlikely she'll come down further enough to make it worthwhile to continue.  You're better off taking John's guaranteed offer of $100."
