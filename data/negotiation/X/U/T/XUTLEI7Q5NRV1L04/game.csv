"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is way too high for me, though. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective on the value, my initial asking price reflects the true worth and potential of this product.  To move towards a mutually agreeable deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This revised offer takes into account the significant value it will bring to your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I could go up to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to make concessions to reach a fair price.  While $700,000 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
