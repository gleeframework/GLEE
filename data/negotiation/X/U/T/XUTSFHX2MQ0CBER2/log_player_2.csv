Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $145. I'm willing to make one last compromise and meet you at $137. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $137.  Since John offers the product for $150, it makes more sense to buy it from him at this point and avoid potentially paying even more."
