``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for the best possible outcome. 
* **Confidence:**  My message conveys confidence in the product's value, hoping to pique Bob's interest.
* **Negotiation Space:** Leaving room for potential negotiation allows for flexibility in the next rounds.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18000 is outside my budget. I'm interested in your product but would be willing to pay $8000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There is still room for negotiation. While Bob's initial offer is too low, his message indicates he is interested in the product. 
* **Future Rounds:** I will use the next round to make a counteroffer that is more aligned with my desired price point.
* **John's Offer:** While $12,000 is a guaranteed sale, I'm not ready to settle for that yet.  I believe I can get a better price from Bob through further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $15,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point but still allows for further negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to justify the price.
* **Negotiation & Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise, but I'm not giving up on my initial goal. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still holding out hope for a better deal with Bob, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $15000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's meet halfway and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is an increase, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob's message suggests he is willing to negotiate further, indicating the possibility of a better offer. 
* **Risk of Losing to John:**  If I reject Bob's offer and then proceed to the next round, the risk of losing to John becomes more significant. However, I believe I can secure a better deal with Bob. 
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** I will aim for a counter-offer that bridges the gap between our positions without compromising my minimum acceptable value."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Although Bob's offer is tempting, there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not yet ready to settle for the minimum. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Bob's message suggests a willingness to compromise, indicating the possibility of a higher offer in the next round. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John would guarantee a sale, the risk of losing to John is lower than the potential reward of a better deal with Bob.
