"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for a much lower price.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm interested in your product but would be willing to pay $8,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $15000. This reflects the value of the product while still allowing for some room for negotiation.  Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $8,000. He should continue to negotiate with Alice, hoping to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's meet halfway and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $13000 for this valuable product. It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth while showing my commitment to reaching an agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his desired price, $13,000 is still above his maximum of $8,000. He should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price. If he doesn't, he can always choose to buy from John at $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts. However, $13,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down to $11500. This is a significant compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's finalize this agreement and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice has repeatedly rejected Bob's counteroffers, and although she's lowered her price, it's still above his budget. Bob has only three rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will budge further. He's already spent several rounds negotiating and is unlikely to get a better deal. It's more efficient and cost-effective to buy from John at $8,000."
