"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $8,000 to Bob. I'm hoping to get a good price while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $8,500?  I'm genuinely interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is close to my minimum, I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of this negotiation.  I'm not in a huge rush, and I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference at $8,750?  I'm confident you'll find this product a great value at that price."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,750 is still a bit outside my range. I'm happy to pay $8,250.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,250 is a good price, I'm confident that I can get closer to my ideal price point.  I'm also factoring in the fact that if I can't reach a deal with Bob, I can always sell to John for $8,000.  I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $8,500. This price is fair for both of us and ensures a successful transaction. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
