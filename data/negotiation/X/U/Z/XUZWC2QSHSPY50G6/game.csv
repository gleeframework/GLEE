"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is close, but I can't go that low.  My final offer is $12,500.  It's a great price for something you value at $15,000",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not comfortable with $12,500. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",12000.0,Bob,6,
