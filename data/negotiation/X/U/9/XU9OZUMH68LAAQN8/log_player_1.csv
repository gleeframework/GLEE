Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it can greatly benefit you. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob can potentially increase our profit.
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000.  Offering it slightly below John's price creates a perceived deal for Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The $950,000 offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also keeps the price significantly above Bob's valuation, protecting our potential profit.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing the potential profit from the transaction."
