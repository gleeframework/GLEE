"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this valuable product for $950,000. It's worth $1,000,000 to you, so you'll be getting a fantastic deal.  Let me know if you're interested! If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing.** She claims she'll sell the product for $800,000 to someone else if you refuse, but that's less than its value to her ($800,000). Sellers don't intentionally take losses.
* **You have a better alternative.** John offers the product at your maximum price ($1,000,000). While not ideal, it's better than Alice's inflated offer.
* **Room for negotiation.** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal you're not desperate. There's a chance she might come back with a more reasonable price closer to her actual value. 

**By rejecting, you keep the door open for a better deal, either from Alice or by sticking with John.**"
