"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also allows for a polite and open dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is better than Bob's initial value, it's still below my minimum threshold. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $12,500 is still significantly below the value of the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,500 is the lowest I can go.  This price still provides a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $13,000 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to accept $13,250. This final price represents a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a deal worth pursuing."", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a better price, but I'm still not comfortable with $13250. I'm willing to go up to $13100, but I can't go any higher.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial minimum, the negotiation is getting longer and there is a risk of Bob backing out or getting a better deal elsewhere.  It's time to take the best offer I have so far to avoid losing out. $13,100 is a better deal than the guaranteed $15,000 from John, so accepting is the more strategic move at this point."
