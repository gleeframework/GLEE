"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a truly unique product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,200,000, and Alice is offering the product at that exact price, there's no benefit to accepting her offer. You're not saving any money. 

Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or explore other options without any immediate financial commitment."
