"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",7500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $7,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $6,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $7,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I believe it's a great compromise. What do you think?",7000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $7,000 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $6,750? This would be a fair compromise for both of us and we could finalize the deal.",6750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,750. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $7,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a little hesitant at $7,200.  Let's try $7,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you say?",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $7,000, Bob. I think we're close, but I need to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $7,150. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",7150.0,Alice,7,
