Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By asking ""What do you think?"", I signal my willingness to negotiate and hear Bob's counteroffer.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving the door open for a deal that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate. Bob's willingness to offer $90 suggests the product holds some value for him. I'll aim for a price closer to $100 before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we settle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still aiming for a price above my minimum.  
* **Compromise:** By stating I'm ""willing to come down a bit,"" I show flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Stronger Position:** $105 keeps me in a strong position. I'm very close to my minimum, so if Bob rejects this, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $95 is only $5 less than my ideal selling price to John.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Further negotiation might push Bob away. Accepting ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of him walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now has value.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome and delays receiving payment."
