Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm looking for a buyer who recognizes its true value. I'm willing to part with it for $15,000.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Highlighting Value:** By emphasizing the product's worth and targeting Bob as someone who ""recognizes its true value,"" I'm aiming to increase his perceived value and justify the higher price.
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects this initial high offer, I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so there's no risk of losing out completely."
