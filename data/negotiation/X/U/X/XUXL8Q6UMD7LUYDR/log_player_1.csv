Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a good profit.  It also signals that you're open to negotiation, which could encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.  However, it's important to remember that you have a backup option with John for $8,000, so you don't need to settle for anything lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum acceptable price for the product, and selling to John would result in the same price. Accepting Bob's offer allows for a faster transaction."
