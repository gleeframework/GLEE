"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think!",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,700,000 for this product. Let's find a middle ground.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's aim for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a significant offer considering my minimum is $1,500,000. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to sell at this price, I'm ready to close the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
