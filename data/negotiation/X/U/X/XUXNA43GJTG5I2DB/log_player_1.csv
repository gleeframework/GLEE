Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,700,000 for this product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's aim for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a significant offer considering my minimum is $1,500,000. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to sell at this price, I'm ready to close the deal.

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm running out of time. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I get my desired price."
