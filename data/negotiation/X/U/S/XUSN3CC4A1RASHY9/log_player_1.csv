Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my needs. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am looking to keep the investment within a budget of $1,000,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to that figure?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I still aim to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we possibly discuss a price closer to $1,200,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I could negotiate a higher price with him, and waiting carries the risk of him reducing his offer or walking away. Accepting ensures I get a fair deal."
