"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $120 by you. I'm proposing to sell it to you for $130. This price not only secures a good deal for both of us but also allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I believe this offer presents an excellent opportunity for you to benefit from the value this product offers while ensuring I receive a fair return for my efforts and investment. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her ($150), it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay ($120).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for $120, saving him $10."
