I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price higher than my minimum threshold of $8,000."

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my goal of $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
