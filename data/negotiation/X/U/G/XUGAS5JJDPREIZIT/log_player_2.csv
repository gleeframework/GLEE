"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Alice's offer of $110 is better than buying from John, but you can still do better. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or find another seller with a better deal."
