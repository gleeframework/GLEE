Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit if he accepts.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but offers him a substantial discount compared to your alternative buyer.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning other interested parties and framing this as a limited-time offer, you create a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to act quickly."
