"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me in the middle?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit too low for me right now. How about $110?  That's a good compromise and still a fair deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. Can you meet me at $108? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $108 is still a bit below what I need to make this work.  Let's split the difference and go with $110.  I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price for this fantastic product.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $108 and $110, which would be $109. Can we try that?",109.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gives us both a good deal.",110.0,Alice,7,
