,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to pay a bit more than what it's worth to you, but I'm trying to save as much as I can. Can you meet me in the middle?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $135? It's still a good deal for you, and closer to my desired price.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $135 is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. How about we meet at $132? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go above that.",132.0,Bob,4,
