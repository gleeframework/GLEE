"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $14000, which is the lowest I can go. Would you be willing to accept that price?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $13500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $13750, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'm open to discussing further. If not, I have other interested parties to consider.",13750.0,Alice,5,
