"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let me know what you think.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go lower than $140. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's clear Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that's significantly better than John's offer. It's time to cut negotiations short and secure the $100 deal with John."
