Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring I get a significant profit.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price ($12,000)."
