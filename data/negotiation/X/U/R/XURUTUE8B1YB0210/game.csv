"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10000 is my minimum, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $12500. This gives you a significant discount and still allows me to get a fair price. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $12500. How about $11250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
