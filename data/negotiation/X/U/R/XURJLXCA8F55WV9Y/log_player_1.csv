Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value, even more so than this offer reflects, but I'm hoping for a quick and easy sale."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have an advantage knowing Bob values the product at $10,000. This allows you to aim higher than that.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate you down, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** By mentioning the product's high value, even at the offered price, you might nudge Bob towards accepting. 
* **Urgency:**  Highlighting a ""quick and easy sale"" might encourage Bob to decide quickly, especially if he fears you might sell it to someone else. 

**Important:** It's crucial to appear confident in your offer. If Bob senses hesitation or desperation, he might lowball you."
