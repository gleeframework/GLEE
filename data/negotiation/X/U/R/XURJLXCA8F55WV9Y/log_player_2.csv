"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value, even more so than this offer reflects, but I'm hoping for a quick and easy sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your budget and what John is offering.  There's no reason to even try to negotiate with Alice.  Buying from John gets you the product at the best price."
