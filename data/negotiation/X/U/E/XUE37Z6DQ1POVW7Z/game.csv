"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your initial offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1,280,000? This represents a significant movement on my part while still recognizing the inherent value of the product.",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,280,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,220,000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",1220000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but your most recent offer doesn't reflect the progress we've made. I'm willing to accept $1,260,000 - it's my final offer.  It's a fair deal considering the value this product brings.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",1260000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're willing to make a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,260,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,240,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you reconsider?",1240000.0,Bob,8,
