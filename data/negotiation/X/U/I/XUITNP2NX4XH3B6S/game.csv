"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000. However, I'm still a bit stretched at that price.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
