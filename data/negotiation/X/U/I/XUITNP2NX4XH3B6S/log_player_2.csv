"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,200,000. This means there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, but I'm still determined to save more. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further."

Alice has come down to $1,000,000, which is still above my target of $800,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm concerned that I might end up spending more than I'm comfortable with.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John."
