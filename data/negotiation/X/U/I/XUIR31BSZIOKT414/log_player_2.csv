You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  There's no need to pay more than your fallback option. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially come down on price, or you can proceed with buying from John and save $150,000."
