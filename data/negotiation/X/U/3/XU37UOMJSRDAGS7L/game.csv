,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really looking for a price closer to $9,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to get the product and you to sell it at a profit. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'll meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,000.  I'm willing to go up to $9,750 for the product, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal here.

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm still not getting the profit I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'll meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $9,875. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",9875.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800 for the product, which is very close to your last offer. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the final offer I can make.  Let's close this deal.",9800.0,Bob,8,
