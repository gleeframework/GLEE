"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $11,000 is still above your target of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still a bit over your target, but closer than before. Let's see if we can get Alice to go a bit lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really looking for a price closer to $9,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to get the product and you to sell it at a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'll meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to your target than previous offers, you're still $2,000 above it.  It's worth pushing for a lower price, especially as Alice has already indicated she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,000.  I'm willing to go up to $9,750 for the product, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal here. "", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm still not getting the profit I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'll meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $9,875. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're getting closer to your target, but $9,875 is still a bit too high.  It's worth making one more counteroffer to see if you can get Alice to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800 for the product, which is very close to your last offer. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the final offer I can make.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $9,900. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've gotten very close to your target price with Alice, but it's clear she's unwilling to go lower than $9,900. You only have one round left.  It's better to lock in the $8,000 price with John than risk getting stuck with a price that's still above your goal."
