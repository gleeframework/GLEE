"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I think I can make you an offer of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $100 is his ceiling price, meaning he likely won't go any higher. While I could try to negotiate him up slightly, it's not worth the risk of him walking away. John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, so it's the safest and most logical option at this point."
