"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I recognize the value you see in the product, $1200000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to achieve.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This is a fair price considering the product's unique capabilities and potential. I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1350000. Would you be open to considering $1250000? I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I still feel $1250000 is a bit low given the product's unique value.  Let's meet halfway once more. I'm willing to accept $1300000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  I truly believe this product has the potential to significantly benefit your business, and I'm confident that you'll find it to be a wise investment.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going up to $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, but I think $1275000 is the highest I can go. I'm getting close to my budget, and I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider this offer?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
