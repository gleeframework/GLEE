Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is strategic for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  At $100, Bob still gets a good deal, as the product is worth $80 to him.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:**  This ensures you make a profit even if Bob accepts.
* **It's a compromise:** You're willing to go slightly lower than your minimum to get the sale, rather than risk a sure thing with John. 

Let's see what Bob decides!"
