"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $980000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I believe this price reflects a good balance for both parties.",980000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to go up to $965000, but I think that's as high as I can go.
