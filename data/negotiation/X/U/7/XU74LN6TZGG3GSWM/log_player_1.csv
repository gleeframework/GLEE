Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is above my minimum value of $150, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he isn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $150 is my minimum, I'd prefer to get a bit more. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting too low for my liking.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to go below my minimum value of $150. Since John is willing to pay $150, I'm going to sell the product to him."
