"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $11,000.  I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is quite high, considering her product's worth to her is much lower. It makes sense to negotiate and try to bring the price down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, I'm on a tight budget, and $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Grounded:** Starting with a lower offer of $8,000 aims to quickly gauge Alice's flexibility and sets a target price close to her product's value to her. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message keeps the tone polite and suggests a willingness to negotiate further if Alice isn't immediately receptive. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 10 rounds, it's important to move negotiations along efficiently, and a somewhat bold counter-offer can help achieve this."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved from her initial offer, $9,500 is still quite high. We've successfully brought her down, signaling some flexibility on her part. Continuing to negotiate is worthwhile to try and close the gap further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $8,750? I think that's a reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 8750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concessions:** We're moving in smaller increments now, signaling to Alice that we're getting closer to our limit. A $750 increase from our last offer shows willingness to compromise but not capitulate.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  We're still aiming for a price well below her offer, encouraging her to continue negotiating rather than getting stuck.
* **Deadline Awareness:** With time ticking away, a slightly faster pace of concessions might be needed to reach an agreement before we run out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer.  I can tell you're serious, so let's make this happen. How about $9,200 and we have a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly getting closer to a deal, but $9,200 is still above our target. We're only $450 apart now, so there's room to negotiate further without risking the deal entirely. It's worth pushing a bit more before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. That's a very fair offer, and I'm eager to finalize this deal."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  Meeting directly in the middle of the remaining difference ($400 split) shows strong willingness to compromise and creates a sense of fairness that Alice might find hard to refuse.
* **Urgency:**  Phrases like ""finalize this deal"" and ""eager"" add a touch of urgency without sounding desperate. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** While we're getting closer to Alice's price, we're still conscious of John's $12,000 offer.  We have a few more rounds to work with before that becomes the more appealing option."
