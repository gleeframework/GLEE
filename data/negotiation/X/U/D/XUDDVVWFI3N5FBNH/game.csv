"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm not willing to compromise too much. I'm offering you the product for $850,000. This is still a great price considering its value. Let's work towards a solution that benefits us both.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a higher offer.  $775,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $825,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal at this point.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $795,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",795000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I'm really trying to work with you here. Your last offer is only $5,000 away from my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $800,000. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,7,
