"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and more than what I'd get from another buyer. Let's make this happen!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This way, we can both walk away happy and I can avoid selling to John for a lower price. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
