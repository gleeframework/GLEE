"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your valuation of the product and am willing to meet you halfway. I propose to sell the product to you for $90, which is a $10 discount from my initial asking price. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is a fair compromise considering her initial offer was $95 and your counteroffer was $85.  Buying from Alice at $90 is a better deal than paying $100 to John."
