"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any higher than $110. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $110 is the best I can do. It's still a good deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,7,
