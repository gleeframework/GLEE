"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $700,000?  I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I need to get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $700,000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's find a compromise.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I agree it's a good product, $850,000 is still a little too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? This offer represents a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. I need to try and get closer to my target price.  While I could sell to John for $800,000, I'm hoping to secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I hear you, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $775,000 is still too far below my desired price.  Let's try to meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This offer reflects the value of the product while providing you with a significant saving. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we settle on $800,000?  This seems like a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to sell the product to Bob for a higher price, his current offer of $800,000 matches the price that John is willing to pay. Given that we are down to the 6th round, and I am running out of time, I will accept Bob's offer."
