"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still gives you a great deal on this valuable product. This price reflects the true value and potential benefits it offers. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
