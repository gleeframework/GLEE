"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1500000. I'm open to negotiating, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $1220000. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",1220000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go above $1230000. I'm willing to meet you at $1225000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me here, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to go above $1200000. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
