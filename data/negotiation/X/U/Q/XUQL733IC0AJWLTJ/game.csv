,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I believe this price fairly reflects the value this product brings.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  $12,000 is still a bit low for me considering the value this product holds. What if we settled on $14,500? That's me coming down significantly to try and meet your needs.",14500.0,Alice,5,
