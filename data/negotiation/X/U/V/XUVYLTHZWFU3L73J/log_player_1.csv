Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant return you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible, while still ensuring a good deal for myself.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return"" emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.

This strategy aims for a price that is significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000) while staying attractive enough to hopefully close the deal with Bob, who benefits the most from the product."
