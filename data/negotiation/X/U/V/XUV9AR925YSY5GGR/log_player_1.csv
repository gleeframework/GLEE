Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, incorporating negotiation tactics:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  It's something I value highly, but I believe its true potential would be unlocked in your hands. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Given its potential value to you, I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High but Negotiable Starting Point:** By starting at $1,150,000, Alice anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above her minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Emphasis on Value to Bob:** The message highlights how the product specifically benefits Bob, increasing his perceived value and willingness to pay.
* **Open to Discussion:** The phrase ""starting point for discussions"" signals to Bob that Alice is open to negotiation, making him more likely to engage.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This offer assumes Bob is open to a potentially collaborative negotiation. If Alice knows Bob to be a hard bargainer, she might adjust her strategy accordingly.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If Alice is under time pressure to sell, she might lower her asking price to secure a deal with Bob quickly."
