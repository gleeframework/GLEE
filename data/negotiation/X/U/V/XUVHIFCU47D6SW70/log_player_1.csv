{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but not excessively high to scare Bob off immediately.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's less than half of my minimum value. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to $100, still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but demonstrating my willingness to compromise. Hopefully, this will get us closer to an acceptable middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer again. I'm getting a bit impatient, but I want to see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $90. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me in the middle. If he doesn't, I'm going to sell the product to John and move on."
