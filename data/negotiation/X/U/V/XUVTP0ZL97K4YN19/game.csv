"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I think the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects its unique value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $650,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",650000.0,Alice,5,
