"Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but the price I offered reflects the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $14,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my means.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffers.  However, $14,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I could go as low as $15,500. This is my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
