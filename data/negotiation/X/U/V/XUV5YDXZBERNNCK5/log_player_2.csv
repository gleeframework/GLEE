"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my maximum budget. I want to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $11,500 for the product. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is closer to my maximum budget, but still a bit high. I want to see if I can get her down further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept it. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $11,250 for the product. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is very close to my final offer of $11,000. While I'd prefer to pay less, the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially having to buy from John at $15,000 is too high. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price within my budget."
