Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $137. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer is now $137, which is getting closer to John's price of $150.
* Bob has already made a counteroffer of $130 and Alice rejected it, showing she's not willing to budge much. 
* At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation is high, and it's more likely that the price will only go up further. 
* It's better for Bob to accept John's offer of $150 to avoid the potential of paying even more to Alice in the remaining rounds."
