"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $22,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is my maximum. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $19,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $12,000. This would give us both a reasonable deal and potentially make a sale happen.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution. While $12,000 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to accept it IF you can close the deal today.  This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
