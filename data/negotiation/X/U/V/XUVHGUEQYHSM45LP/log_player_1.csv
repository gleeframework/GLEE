"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I believe this deal is mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price above Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This is a common tactic to maximize potential profit.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefit for Bob, suggesting this is a ""fair"" deal for him, making it more likely he'll consider it.
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm not asking for my full desired price yet, as I have room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Still Below Value:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Opportunity to Improve:** I have multiple rounds left, and I believe I can secure a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed outcome. However, continuing negotiations with Bob gives me the potential to earn even more, which is worth the risk at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $980,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's last offer but still higher. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away too much.
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm using language that emphasizes the value of the product (""true value"") and tries to create a sense of fairness (""significant concession"" and ""fair price for both of us""). 
* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm leaving room for further negotiation, but I'm still aiming for a price that is closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered it carefully, and I'm willing to pay $960,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my target. I believe I can push for a better deal with more rounds of negotiation.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 would secure a profit, but I'm still within striking distance of a higher price.  Waiting could result in a significantly better outcome.
* **Risk Tolerance:** I'm comfortable with the risk of continuing to negotiate. The potential reward of a higher price outweighs the risk of Bob ultimately rejecting my final offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement in this negotiation.  While your offer is getting closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $970,000, but that's my final offer. This reflects the value of the product and also leaves some room for both of us to feel good about the deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 970000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm narrowing the gap between our offers, but still maintaining a position that's favorable to me.
* **Finality:** I'm framing this as my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and pressure Bob to accept.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on the benefits of the deal for both of us, making it more likely Bob will see the value in accepting.
* **Slight Concession:**  I'm only coming down $10,000 from my previous offer, signaling that I'm not willing to budge much further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to pay $965,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I'm running out of time to secure a better price.
* **Small Increment:** Bob's offer has only increased by $5,000, indicating he's not willing to budge much further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a high chance Bob will continue to lowball me, and I might end up with a price closer to his initial valuation. Selling to John guarantees me a significant profit and eliminates the risk of a stalemate.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John provides a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a safe and substantial return on my investment."
