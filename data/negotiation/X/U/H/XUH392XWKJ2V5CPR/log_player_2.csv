(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can get the product for a lower price than from John, and Alice is likely willing to negotiate to avoid losing the sale."

You can still get a better price than John's $100.  Let's keep negotiating with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92.50. That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.

While $92.5 is a good deal compared to John's $100, we can still try to push for a lower price.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle again."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $89.  It's closer to your last offer, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 89}

Alice is getting closer to your desired price. It's a good deal for you compared to buying from John, and the negotiations are getting long. It's worth accepting the offer to secure the product."
