"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which is a fair price considering both our positions.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate.  $925,000 is closer, but I still need a bit more to make this work for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $937,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product.",937500.0,Alice,5,
