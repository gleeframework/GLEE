Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $850,000 is still a good deal. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and any further negotiation could risk losing the sale entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further rounds of negotiation."
