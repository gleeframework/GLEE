"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $100? It's a fair price for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than that.",100.0,Alice,5,
