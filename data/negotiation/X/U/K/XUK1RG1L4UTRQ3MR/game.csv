"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $2000000. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid the product's value is worth much more than $500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1200000 for it. Would you be open to discussing this price?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $1000000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
