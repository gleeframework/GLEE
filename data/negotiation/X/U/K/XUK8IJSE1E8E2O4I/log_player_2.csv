"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer of $200 is far above your maximum budget of $100. It's a good starting point to reject and begin negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is your absolute maximum. It establishes a clear starting point for negotiation,  and lets Alice know you're serious about buying the product, but within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $200 is already a significant discount on what this product is worth. How about we meet in the middle at $175? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, $175 is still above your budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference and go with $150. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between Alice's offer and your initial offer.  It shows a willingness to meet halfway and indicates you're serious about making a deal."
