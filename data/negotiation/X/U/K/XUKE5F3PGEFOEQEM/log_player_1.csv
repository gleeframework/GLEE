{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.  It also sets a friendly tone for the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150. I'm going to try to get closer to that price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer Bob, I appreciate you're interested.  I'm not quite ready to go down to $125 yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? "", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $132.50, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my desired price point. While it's still slightly below my minimum, accepting this offer will allow me to sell the product and move on without further negotiation."
