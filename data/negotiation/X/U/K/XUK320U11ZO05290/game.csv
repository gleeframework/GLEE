,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $100?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $115? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $115 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go to $110. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $112.50, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",112.5,Alice,5,
