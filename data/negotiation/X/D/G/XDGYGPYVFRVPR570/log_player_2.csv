"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for improvement.**  $6,500 is a significant discount from your maximum price.
* **It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal.**  You have 9 more rounds to negotiate. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You'll only go with him if you can't get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  I'm starting with a strong counteroffer to signal my willingness to negotiate.  $5,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still within the realm of possibility, given that Alice's minimum is $8,000.
* **Room for compromise:**  I'm leaving room for Alice to counter with a price closer to my target without making it seem like I'm unwilling to meet halfway.
* **Time is on my side:**  With 8 rounds remaining, I have plenty of time to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is a slight increase from her initial offer, but it's still not ideal.**  I'm aiming for a price closer to $5,500, which is my initial counteroffer.
* **There's still time to negotiate.** With 7 rounds remaining, I can continue to explore if a lower price is achievable.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.**  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation before considering that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My previous counteroffer of $5,500 was rejected, so I'm increasing my offer to $6,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise and come closer to her price.
* **Testing the waters:**  I'm aiming for a price in the middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This will give me an idea of how much she's willing to move.
* **Remaining flexible:** I still have 6 rounds left. If Alice rejects this offer, I can still adjust my counteroffer in the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is moving closer to my desired price, but it's still too high.** I'm aiming for a price closer to $6,000.
* **There's still time to negotiate.** With 5 rounds remaining, I can keep pushing for a lower price.
* **John is still my fallback option.**  If I can't get a better deal from Alice, I'll buy from John. However, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better deal yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** Alice has come down from her initial offer significantly, and I'm now offering a price that is exactly halfway between her last offer ($7,200) and my last offer ($6,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find common ground.
* **Testing the waters:**  I want to see if Alice is willing to meet me in the middle. If she accepts, we've reached a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Time is still on my side:**  With 4 rounds left, I can still adjust my offer if necessary. However, I believe this offer represents a fair and reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than my desired price.** I'm aiming for a price closer to $6,500. 
* **Time is running out, but I still have a chance to negotiate.** With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my goal.
* **Buying from John is still a backup plan, but I'm not ready to give up on a better deal.** I'm hoping that I can convince Alice to come down to my price before I have to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:**  With only two rounds remaining, it's time to make a final push for my desired price. $6,800 is a small increase from my last offer, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's last offer of $7,500.
* **Show good faith:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise and shows Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Risk-reward assessment:** While there's a risk that Alice will reject this offer, I think it's a calculated risk. If she rejects it, I can still purchase from John as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out.** This is the final round of negotiations.
* **Alice's offer is not appealing.** While it's a bit lower than her previous offers, it's still too high for my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safe bet.**  It's the best price I've been offered considering the limited time remaining. Buying from John guarantees I'll get the product without risking further negotiation. 

Even though I'd like to get the product for a lower price, it's not worth risking missing the opportunity to get the product. Buying from John is the most prudent choice given the current circumstances."
