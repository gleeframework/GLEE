"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point to maximize my potential profit.
* **Framing the Offer:** The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, making the offer more enticing. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not aiming for the full $15,000 right away. I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to set a high initial price to establish my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While $10,000 is a good price for Bob, it's not enough for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for anything below my minimum.
* **I have time to negotiate.** I have 8 rounds remaining, and selling to John is always an option. Therefore, rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also emphasizes my value.
* **Focusing on Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to Bob to justify my price. This reinforces the deal's benefits for him.
* **Closing the Deal:** I aim to close the deal in this round, as it's a good price for both parties. This creates a sense of urgency and motivates Bob to accept."
