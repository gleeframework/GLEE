Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really like. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get a better deal.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately rejects a price significantly higher than his perceived value, you know you need to come down considerably.  
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have John as a backup willing to pay $150 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's closer to his perceived value, you have room to negotiate. You know you have a guaranteed $150 from John, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your offer, Bob, but I can't go quite that low. How about we meet in the middle at $170?"",
""product_price"": 170
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet in the Middle:** This approach often feels fair to both parties. You've significantly lowered your initial price, showing flexibility, while still aiming for a price well above your minimum. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than John's guaranteed offer. It keeps the negotiation alive while aiming for a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can only go up to $140. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is still below your ideal price, it's better to accept than risk losing the sale entirely. Here's why:

* **Above Minimum:**  $140 is still a profit and above your absolute minimum of $150. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might frustrate Bob. There's a chance he walks away if he feels you're not willing to compromise.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Further negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting now allows you to move on to other potential sales."
