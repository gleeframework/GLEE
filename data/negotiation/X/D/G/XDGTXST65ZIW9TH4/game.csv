"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on this product. However, I'm looking to get it for closer to $10,000.  That's still a great deal for you, and it's within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to get it a bit lower.  $11,000 would be a good compromise for me.  This way we both walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
