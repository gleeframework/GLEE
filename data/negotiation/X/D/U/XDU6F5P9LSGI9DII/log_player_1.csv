Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is higher than your minimum of $120, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The price is lower than what Bob values the product at, so he has an incentive to negotiate. This allows you to potentially get closer to your ideal price.
* **It shows you're willing to be flexible:** By making an initial offer, you're signaling that you're open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $130.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $130 is above your minimum, you can likely do better. It's worth exploring further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  I can't go as low as $130 right now. How about we split the difference at $135?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
