"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $700,000. I'm offering you the product for $800,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
