"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,150,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,125,000. Can you consider this price?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering the product for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our goals. Let's close this deal.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your desire to reach a fair compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
