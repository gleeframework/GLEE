Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000:**  This is a higher price than John's offer, giving Bob an incentive to buy. 
* **Reasoning:** I am trying to maximize my profit. By offering a higher price to Bob, I increase the chances of him accepting, as he might value the product more than $1,200,000. If he rejects, I still have John's offer as a safety net."
