Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. It's a steal!,150.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice! Thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value this product, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Would you consider $105? That's a fair compromise.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $115. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,
