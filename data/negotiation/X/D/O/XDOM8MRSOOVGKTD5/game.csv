"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $150? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",150.0,Alice,3,
