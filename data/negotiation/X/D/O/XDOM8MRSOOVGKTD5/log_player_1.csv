Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can go.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
