"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but $750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $700000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $725000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $725000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $710000 for the product.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",710000.0,Bob,4,
