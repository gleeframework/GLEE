Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value.  Based on my assessment, the market value of this product is $800,000. However, I'm willing to start the conversation with a slightly lower price.  I'm offering it to you for $750,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but $750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum target of $800,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a higher price.  Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum price, but I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price point by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $700,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $725,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 725000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $725000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $710000 for the product.  Let's try to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $710,000.
