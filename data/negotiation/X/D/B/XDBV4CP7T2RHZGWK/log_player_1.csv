"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than my minimum, I think I can get closer to my desired price with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer of $105.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit, and it's better than selling to John for $80."
