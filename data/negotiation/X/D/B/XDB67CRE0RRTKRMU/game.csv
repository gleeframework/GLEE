"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you do $975,000?  That's the best I can offer.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $975,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,075,000. It's a fair price, considering the value you've already acknowledged the product has for you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
