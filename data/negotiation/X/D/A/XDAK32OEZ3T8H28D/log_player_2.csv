"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can do better than $90.  You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $80. There's room for negotiation!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $87.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $87.50, which is a fair compromise considering my willingness to pay $100 and her minimum of $80. It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation."
