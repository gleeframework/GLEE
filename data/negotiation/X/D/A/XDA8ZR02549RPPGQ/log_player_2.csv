"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $14,000. I believe it will be very valuable for you, and this is a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go below $13,000. This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above Bob's budget.  While it's closer to his maximum, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $10,000 and secure the product within his budget."
