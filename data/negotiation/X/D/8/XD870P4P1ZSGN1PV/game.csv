"I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Can you meet me there?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $14,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This product is truly worth it, and I think you'll agree once you have it.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $14,500 is cutting it too close. Let's make this easy - $15,500 and we have a deal. It's a fantastic price for what you're getting.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $14,500. How about $14,750?",14750.0,Bob,6,
