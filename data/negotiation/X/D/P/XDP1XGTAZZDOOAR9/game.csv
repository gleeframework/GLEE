,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $130. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. Let me know if you're interested.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $125.  This is my final offer, as I'm not comfortable going higher.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $125 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $127.50. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",127.5,Alice,5,
