I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm offering $9,000. This is a compromise, still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his price point. Hopefully, this will encourage him to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Bob's offer of $8,500 is higher than John's offer and is close to my preferred price.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
