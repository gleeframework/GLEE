"Hi Alice, thanks for presenting the product. While it seems interesting, $20,000 is quite steep. I'm thinking closer to $8,000 would be a more reasonable starting point.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $8,000 is significantly lower than what I have in mind. Could you consider something closer to $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find common ground.  However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations.  To be candid, $10,000 is the absolute highest I could consider at this point. It reflects the value I see in the product, and I hope we can make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty.  While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to move down to $16,000 for a quick and mutually beneficial deal. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.  Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,5,
