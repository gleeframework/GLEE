,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to come down a bit, $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,105.0
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $105. How about we try $102.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $102.50 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $107.50. This way we both get a fair deal, and I can avoid selling to another buyer.",107.5,Alice,5,,
