"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to offer $850,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I understand that $1,000,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's try $900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering both our positions.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $950,000, as I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to make one final offer: $920,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",920000.0,Alice,5,
