Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), I start with a significantly higher offer ($2,250,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for the maximum possible profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""immense value"" to justify the high price, subtly anchoring Bob's perception of the product's worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains polite and open to discussion, suggesting willingness to negotiate. This encourages Bob to counter-offer rather than outright rejecting the initial price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** This strategy assumes Bob is willing to pay a premium for something he highly values. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  I have a safety net with John, ensuring I won't be forced to go below my minimum. This strengthens my negotiating position."
