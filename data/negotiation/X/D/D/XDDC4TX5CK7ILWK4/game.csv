"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to only pay up to $950,000. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is considerably below what I can accept. This product offers significant value, and to make a deal work, I would need to see it closer to $1,050,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution in this range.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to go above $975,000 for this product. I hope this offer will be considered reasonable.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're making progress, but we're still a way off. To be frank, accepting anything below $1,020,000 would be leaving significant value on the table for me. If you can meet me at that price, I'm confident we can close this deal today.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to consider $1,000,000 as a compromise. I hope this helps move us closer to closing the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
