"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $10,000 and John is selling it for that exact price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can get the product for the same price from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to keep your options open for a potential better deal in the future."
