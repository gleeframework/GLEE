"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested, I'm only able to go up to $11,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $12,500 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $12,250. This is as low as I can go without losing my profit margin.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to find a compromise. I understand you have a profit margin to maintain, but $12,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. ",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $11,500. I'll make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $12,750. This is the lowest price I can offer and still make a reasonable profit.",12750.0,Alice,7,
