Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $10,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so Alice needs to offer a price lower than his valuation but higher than John's offer.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $9,500 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It's a strong starting point that signals value while still aiming for a high profit."
