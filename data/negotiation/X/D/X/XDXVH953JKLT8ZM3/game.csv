"I understand you're still trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1100000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, let's talk further.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not getting any younger, Bob. I've made several concessions already, and I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point where it's not worth my while to continue negotiating. I can offer it to you for $1020000, which is my final concession. If you're still interested, let's make a deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1020000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but $1020000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $980000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from a competitor.",980000.0,Bob,10,
