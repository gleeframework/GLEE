Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $1,350,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's worth.
