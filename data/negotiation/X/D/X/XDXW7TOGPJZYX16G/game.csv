"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what's best for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I'd need a much lower price to make it worthwhile. How about $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $1,350,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but we're still quite a ways off.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, but that's about as high as I can go.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to continue this discussion. I understand that we both have our limits, but the gap between our positions is still substantial.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it reflects my commitment to reaching a fair deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, that price is still a bit too rich for me.  I could stretch to $1,050,000, but that's really pushing my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
