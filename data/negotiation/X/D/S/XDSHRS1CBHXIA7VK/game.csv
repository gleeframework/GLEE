"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? I believe it's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $10,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer, but still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,750 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference at $10,125? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10125.0,Alice,5,
