Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? I believe it's a fair price."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $10,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer, but still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,750?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,750 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference at $10,125? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her $10,125 offer.  While there's a chance you could haggle her down a bit more, it's not worth the risk of her digging in her heels.  You have a guaranteed option with John for $10,000, saving you at least $125."
