"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than buying from John, there's room for negotiation.  Bob can counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  This still allows me a good profit and lets you acquire the product at a price closer to your target.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. It's a good deal for him, considering he's willing to pay up to $1,500,000.  While he can try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and forcing him to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential savings."
