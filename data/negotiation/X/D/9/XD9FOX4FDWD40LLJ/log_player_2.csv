**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $850,000 is above his budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the unique value of this product, $850,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm eager to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $800000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?

* **Accepting the offer is the most logical choice to secure the product at his budget.**"
