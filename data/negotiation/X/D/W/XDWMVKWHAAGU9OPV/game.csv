"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $13,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $11,500?  That's a reasonable compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $11,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, so my counteroffer is $13,500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to come down a bit more. How about $12,000 even? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
