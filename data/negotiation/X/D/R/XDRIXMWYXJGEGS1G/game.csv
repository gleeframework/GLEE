"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, that price is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
