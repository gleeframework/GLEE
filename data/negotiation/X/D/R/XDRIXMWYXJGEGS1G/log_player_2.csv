It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice.  

Here's why:

* **Alice is Firm:** Her ""final offer"" and unwillingness to budge from $1,050,000 suggest she won't go any lower.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We only have one round left, and there's no guarantee we can reach an agreement in that time. 
* **John is the Safe Bet:** Buying from John guarantees us the product at our maximum price limit. It's better than risking a no-deal with Alice.

While we could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal altogether and ending up with nothing is too high at this point."
