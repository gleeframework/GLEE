"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, you can potentially do better.  Since you are willing to pay up to $150, you have room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm looking to pay closer to $125 for this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $132.50 is a good compromise. It's still within your budget of $150 and closer to your desired price of $125.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price without risking further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or a failed deal."
