"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the potential ROI and the market value of similar products, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value both of us can realize from this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, I can't let this go for less than $1,150,000. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident that at this price, it's a win-win for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to maximize your return, but $1,150,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm confident this product has real value, but I can't justify going above $1,100,000.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
