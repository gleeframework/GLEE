"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000, it's still significantly higher than what you could get it for from John. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or simply buy it from John for a guaranteed lower cost."
