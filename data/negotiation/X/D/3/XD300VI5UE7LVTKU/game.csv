"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $1,500,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, as a starting point. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. It's a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
