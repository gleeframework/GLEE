**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to a price point far below your minimum.  While $900,000 is a significant sum, it represents a $300,000 loss compared to selling to John. At this point, further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer. It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
