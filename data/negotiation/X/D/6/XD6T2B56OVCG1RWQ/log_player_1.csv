"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $175. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $175 is a price Bob might consider, but it leaves room for him to make a counteroffer.  
* **Politeness:** A friendly message establishes a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Even though Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, he's shown interest and acknowledged the value of the product. There's potential for us to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed outcome,  I want to see if I can achieve a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, Thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a significant price reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Profitability:**  $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring a profit for me.
* **Keep Dialogue Open:**  The message remains positive and encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you coming down to $140, but I'm still stuck at $110.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation is getting close:**  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, indicating that we are getting closer to a possible deal. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John is a safe option, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, especially since I have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By offering $125, I'm meeting Bob halfway between his latest offer ($110) and my previous offer ($140). This shows that I'm willing to compromise and reach a middle ground. 
* **Keeping It Positive:** The message stays friendly and emphasizes fairness, making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Maintaining Profitability:** $125 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring that I make a profit. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We're approaching the middle of the negotiation, so I want to push for a deal while remaining flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm still hoping to get it for a little less than $125.  How about $115?  That would be a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:**  We're at round 6, meaning we have only 4 rounds left. The negotiation is taking longer than expected. 
* **Decreasing Gains:** Bob is offering less with each round, and while $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm not sure if I can get a better offer in the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees a profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation.  Given the time constraint, this seems like the most reliable option."
