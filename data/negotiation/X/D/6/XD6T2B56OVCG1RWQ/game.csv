"Hi Bob, Thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let's see if we can make this work.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position. How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I'm still hoping to get it for a little less than $125.  How about $115?  That would be a fair compromise, I think.",115.0,Bob,6,
