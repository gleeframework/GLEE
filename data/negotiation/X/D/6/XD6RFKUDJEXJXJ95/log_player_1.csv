"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  $12,000 gives me space to negotiate down if necessary, while still earning a decent profit.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than the $12,000 I initially offered.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I have 10 rounds and it's early in the game. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $15,000 is guaranteed with John, I can still try to get closer to my value with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $12,000 to $10,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** $10,000 is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, signaling a willingness to find a compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the price as a ""good deal"" for both of us, emphasizing a potential win-win scenario."
