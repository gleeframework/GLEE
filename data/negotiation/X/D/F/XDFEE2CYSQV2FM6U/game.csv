"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This represents a good compromise, and I'm confident that this deal would be beneficial for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
