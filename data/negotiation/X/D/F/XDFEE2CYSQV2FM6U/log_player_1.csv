"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This represents a good compromise, and I'm confident that this deal would be beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""

``` 

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's unlikely he'll reach $800,000.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
