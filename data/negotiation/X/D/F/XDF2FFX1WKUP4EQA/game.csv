"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000? This price still gives you a great value and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position. $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's try $1,200,000.  This would allow us to both come to a fair agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
