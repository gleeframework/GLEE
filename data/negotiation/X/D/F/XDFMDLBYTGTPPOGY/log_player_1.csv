"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to establish a negotiation range. 
* **Leaving Room:**  There's room for me to lower the price in subsequent rounds if needed, without going below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the deal's attractiveness to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity to counter:** I have 10 rounds, and I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** However, selling to John for $1,500,000 is always a viable option, which I'll keep in mind for later rounds if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,575,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to get this done."", ""product_price"": 1575000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with compromise:** I'm countering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still being above my minimum.
* **Meeting in the middle:** $1,575,000 is exactly in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's offer, making it a fair compromise.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob that the deal is still advantageous to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we try $1350000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,350,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiations are ongoing:** We're still in the early rounds of negotiations, and I believe there's potential to get closer to my target price.
* **John is a backup:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 remains a secure option, but I'm willing to continue negotiations with Bob for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,350,000 is just not feasible for me. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and it's a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm lowering my offer to $1,500,000, my absolute minimum, making it clear that I'm serious about closing the deal but won't go any lower.
* **Final offer:**  I'm emphasizing this as my ""final offer"" to put pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this is still a great deal for him, considering the value of the product.
* **Decision time:** This offer is designed to push Bob towards a decision, as I have a backup option with John if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $1500000. How about we try $1250000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is unacceptable:**  $1,250,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's clear that we are too far apart in our valuations.
* **Time is running out:** We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. Continuing to negotiate with Bob may lead to further concessions and a price that's not in my best interest. 
* **John is a guaranteed sale:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a good return and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet my minimum price.  It's time to secure the deal and move on."
