Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves him with a potential ""deal"" if he values it higher in the future.
* **First Refusal Tactic:**  By offering it to Bob first, I create a sense of scarcity and potential loss if he doesn't take the offer.

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a price higher than his perceived value and ensuring I don't miss out on the guaranteed sale to John."
