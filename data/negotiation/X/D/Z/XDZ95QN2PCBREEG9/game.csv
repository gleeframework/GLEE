"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value,  $900000 is below what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This still leaves room for you to benefit significantly from the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $975000 is still not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down to $990000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. We're almost there!",990000.0,Alice,7,
