""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is reflective of its worth and potential ROI. Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher final price. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""potential ROI,"" Alice provides a subtle justification for the high price without explicitly revealing her minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open to discussion, indicating Alice is willing to negotiate to find a mutually agreeable price.

Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and Alice has a guaranteed offer for that amount from John, starting at $1,400,000 allows room for Alice to potentially make more profit if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
