"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $800,000.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. It's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $800,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $700,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $820,000,  which is still a good deal for you considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can find common ground.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $820,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $780,000. That's the best I can do.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $780,000 still isn't workable for me.  I'm willing to compromise further to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum. Let's close this deal - it's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000. That's the lowest I can go.",795000.0,Bob,6,
