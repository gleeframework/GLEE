Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. It's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'll counter-offer and try to reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $700,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $820,000,  which is still a good deal for you considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 820000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $820,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $780,000. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $780,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair. I'll counteroffer one more time to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $780,000 still isn't workable for me.  I'm willing to compromise further to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum. Let's close this deal - it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, I've already gone down as far as I'm comfortable with.  The risk of further negotiation is too high, and I don't want to risk getting a lower price than I can get from John."
