"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique qualities of the product,  $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1400000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1400000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $900000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'd like to add a small premium for the product's unique qualities. I'll sell it to you for $950000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's make a deal!",950000.0,Alice,5,
