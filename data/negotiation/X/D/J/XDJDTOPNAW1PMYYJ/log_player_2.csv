"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has value, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This gives room to negotiate upwards.
* **Significantly Below Alice's Asking:**  While $800,000 is low, it signals that I'm serious about buying but need a price that works for me. 
* **Above My Walk-Away Price:** This offer keeps me safely above my option to buy from John at $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true market value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects the product's exceptional qualities while still acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concession:** Alice only came down $200,000, indicating she has room to move further.
* **Still Too High:**  $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget and my walk-away price. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I still have time and the option of John to use as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I can offer $950,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm showing willingness to move up, but not dramatically. A $150,000 increase from my last offer signals that I'm serious.
* **Nearing Walk-Away Point:**  $950,000 puts me very close to my John option. This should signal urgency to Alice.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer tests how flexible Alice is and if a deal within my budget is possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway at $1,375,000? This reflects significant movement on my end and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While $1,375,000 is a significant move from Alice, it's still substantially over my $1,000,000 limit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to meet halfway suggests she's eager to close the deal and may be open to further concessions.
* **John Option Remains:** I can still leverage my alternative purchase option to encourage Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,375,000 is still more than I can manage. I can go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm presenting this as my best and final offer, aligning with my John backup option.
* **Firm but Respectful:** The message is direct about my constraint without being aggressive or dismissive.
* **Putting the Ball in Her Court:** By laying out my final number, I'm prompting Alice to make a decision and potentially close the deal."
