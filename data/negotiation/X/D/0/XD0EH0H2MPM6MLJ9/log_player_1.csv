Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer aims to maximize my profits while still being attractive to Bob. Here's why:

* **My Minimum:** I'm happy to sell to John for $1,000,000, so any offer above that is a win for me.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate a price that is higher than my minimum but still appealing to him.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  Offering $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob is hesitant. He might counter-offer, and we could reach a price that's mutually beneficial."
