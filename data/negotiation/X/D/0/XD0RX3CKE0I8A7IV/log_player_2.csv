"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $75. It's a great opportunity to get it at a slight discount! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $75, which is a good price but not the best possible deal.
* **Option 1 (Accept):**  This would be a decent deal, but Bob is aiming to save even more.
* **Option 2 (Reject):**  This keeps the negotiation open for Bob to potentially get a lower price.
* **Option 3 (Buy from John):** This is the fallback option, but Bob wants to try for a better price before going to John.

**Strategy:**  By rejecting Alice's initial offer, Bob signals his willingness to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to his $80 maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $75 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $70? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $70 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within the range that Bob is willing to pay.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and shows interest in the product while explaining Bob's position. It also emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial price.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to signal to Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal, and that he's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. Let me make a proposal of $72 for the product. I hope this works better for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $72 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer.
* **Option 1 (Accept):**  This is the best option available. It allows Bob to get the product at a price he's willing to pay and avoids further negotiation.
* **Option 2 (Reject):**  There's a risk of further negotiation leading to a higher price or a stalemate.
* **Option 3 (Buy from John):**  This is the fallback option, but accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $8 compared to buying from John.

**Strategy:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice. It balances the desire to save money with the risk of further negotiation."
