"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $12,000 is quite high. I'm interested in the product but could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price.  However, $9,000 is still more than I had budgeted for this purchase. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 to get this done today. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",8200.0,Alice,5,
