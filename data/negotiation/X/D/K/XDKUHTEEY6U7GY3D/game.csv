"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I've done some research and I'm thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $600000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $750000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value it will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I've done some more research and I'm thinking that $650000 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which is $650000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're still hesitant about the price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $725000. I believe this is the sweet spot where I can still make a decent profit while also meeting you halfway. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to ensure that I'm getting a fair value for my product. Let's meet in the middle at $737500. This is my final offer.",737500.0,Alice,5,
