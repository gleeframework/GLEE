"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you is $1500000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a clear goal of saving money.  While $1,200,000 is less than his maximum, he can likely do better. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet closer to the middle. I'm willing to consider $1100000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being fair to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me while offering a significant discount from your initial offer. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being a reasonable profit for me. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $980,000 is getting close to Bob's counteroffer of $950,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a good chance Alice will become more resistant to further price reductions. Accepting this offer saves Bob $520,000 compared to buying from John and secures the product."
