"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $1,250,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. Please let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value this product holds.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial price. Let's compromise at $1,100,000. This gives you a significant discount and allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?
