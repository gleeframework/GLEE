"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $1,250,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. Please let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider coming down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value this product holds.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial price. Let's compromise at $1,100,000. This gives you a significant discount and allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
