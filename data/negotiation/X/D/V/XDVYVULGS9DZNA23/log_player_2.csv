"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It's closer to my maximum budget than her minimum selling price. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower to see how much she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  Let's split the difference. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but $13,000 is still too high. I'll counter with a price closer to my previous offer to signal I'm serious about a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm open to negotiating further, but $11,500 isn't quite there yet. How about $12,500? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting close, but I think there's still room to negotiate.  Alice is coming down in larger increments, which suggests she's motivated to sell. I'll try a small increase on my end to show I'm willing to meet her closer but not at that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we are getting close! I appreciate you being flexible.  How about $11,800? That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about closing the deal."",
""product_price"": 11800
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both committed to finding a solution.  How about $12,200?  It's a fair compromise, and it's only $200 away from my previous offer. I'm feeling optimistic about reaching an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This price is within a reasonable range, and further negotiation might not yield much more. It's a good deal compared to John's offer."
