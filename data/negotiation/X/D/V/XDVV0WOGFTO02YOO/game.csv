"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1200000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $1300000? This still represents a significant savings for you, and it's a price I can realistically accept.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $1250000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to go down to $1350000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
