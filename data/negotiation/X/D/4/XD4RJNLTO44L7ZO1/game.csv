"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can we meet in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $12000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go up to $13500. Would you be willing to consider $11000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11000 is simply too low for me to accept. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is a fair compromise and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer! While I appreciate your offer, $10800 is still a bit below what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $11650? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",11650.0,Alice,7,
