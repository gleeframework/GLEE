"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can we meet in the middle?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I think I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $12,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than John's offer, I think I can still get more from Bob if I continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is simply too low for me to accept. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair compromise and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While $10,800 is a decent offer and only slightly less than John's, I'm going to try for one more round to see if I can get Bob to meet me in the middle. It's possible I can push him higher with just a little more persuasion."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell to John.  We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too close to John's offer.  I'm confident I can make a better deal with Bob in the future, so I'll take the guaranteed $10,000 now and try again with Bob later."
