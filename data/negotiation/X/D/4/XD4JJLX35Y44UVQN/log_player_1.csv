"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $150, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum, to leave room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling flexibility by mentioning that I'm open to negotiation. This encourages Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. Based on my research and budget, I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price at this point.  I will continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:**  I'm acknowledging his offer and showing that I'm listening to his perspective.
* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still leaves room for potential compromise. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer by mentioning the value of the product.
* **Openness:**  I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with a price of $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer, and I risk losing time and potentially losing the sale altogether. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
