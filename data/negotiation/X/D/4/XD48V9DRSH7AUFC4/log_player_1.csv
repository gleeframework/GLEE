{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, knowing it's more than Bob values it at but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I want to avoid immediately going to John, as Bob might be willing to pay a bit more if given the chance to counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 

* **Counteroffer:** I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to meet him halfway with a counteroffer in the next round. 
* **Staying Open:**  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I still see potential for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $8,000 is a good starting point, I need to at least get $9,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,000? I'm sure you'll agree it's still a great deal for a product worth so much."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer is a compromise, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product for Bob while also highlighting the compromise I'm making. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** This approach keeps the negotiation open and avoids rushing into a decision.  

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us, increasing the chances of a successful sale while staying above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Given the value I place on the product, I am comfortable with an offer of $8500. This seems like a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my target.

* **Continuing Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going.  There's still room for a compromise.
* **Potential Agreement:** A final counteroffer might be enough to convince Bob, or at least get him closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John is my last resort. I want to exhaust all negotiation possibilities with Bob first."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on $8,500. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a significant concession for me. It's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:**  This is my final counteroffer, aiming to get as close as possible to my desired price. 
* **Significant Concession:**  I'm making a substantial compromise by dropping my price to $9,500, signaling my willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasizing Value:** The message highlights the product's value and the fairness of the proposed price, encouraging Bob to accept. 
* **Closing the Deal:**  This counteroffer is framed as a final offer to pressure Bob into making a decision and avoid further negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open one last time. If Bob rejects, I'll move on to John."
