"Bob, I understand your position. While $8000 is a good starting point, I need to at least get $9000 to make this worthwhile for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9000? I'm sure you'll agree it's still a great deal for a product worth so much.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on $8500. I'm willing to come down to $9500, which is a significant concession for me. It's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's close this deal. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
