,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $14000, which is still a fair price considering the value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still unable to meet at $14000. I believe we can find a solution closer to $8000. How about we aim for $10000? ",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but to keep things moving, I'm willing to meet you at $11000. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,5,
