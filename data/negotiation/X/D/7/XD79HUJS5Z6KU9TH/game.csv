"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is still a significant discount from my original price. I believe this product has a lot of value to offer, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in discussing further.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1200000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $800000.  If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1200000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and counteroffer at $1000000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in discussing further.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1000000 is still higher than what I'm able to offer. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $800000.  If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
