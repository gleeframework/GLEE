,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for something a bit higher. How about $950,000? This would give you a good deal and allow me to make a profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit too rich for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me.  Given the product's value and the potential benefits it offers you, I believe $940,000 would be a fair price for both of us. This would be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to move closer to my target price. What do you think?",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $940,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not comfortable going above $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $940,000, which would be $932,500. Can we meet at this price?",932500.0,Bob,6,
