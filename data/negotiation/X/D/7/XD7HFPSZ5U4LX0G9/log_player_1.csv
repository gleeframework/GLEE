{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to try and maximize my profit.
* **Room for Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, leaving space for Bob to make counteroffers without feeling like he's getting a raw deal. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to foster a positive negotiation environment.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response and be ready to negotiate further, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and the potential to sell to John for that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There's a chance I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **John's Offer is Still Secure:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option if I don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll make a counteroffer, trying to bridge the gap between his offer and my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for something a bit higher. How about $950,000? This would give you a good deal and allow me to make a profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $950,000 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his initial offer and my previous offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a better price.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and encouraging, highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the good deal Bob would get at $950,000, reminding him of the value of the product.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If he accepts, great! If not, I'll continue to negotiate with him, but I'll also keep the option of selling to John for $1,200,000 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit too rich for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000. How about $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $925,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. 
* **Risk of Settling Too Low:** If I accept this offer, I'll be selling the product for significantly less than what it's worth to me.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's still a good chance I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **John's Offer Remains:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option if negotiations with Bob break down.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll focus on highlighting the value of the product and trying to bridge the remaining gap between his offer and my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me.  Given the product's value and the potential benefits it offers you, I believe $940,000 would be a fair price for both of us. This would be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to move closer to my target price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** My counteroffer of $940,000 represents a small increase from Bob's last offer, demonstrating flexibility while still trying to secure a higher price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value and the potential benefits he would gain.
* **Fair Deal:** I'm positioning the offer as a ""good deal"" for Bob, framing the negotiation as a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be prepared to negotiate further if necessary, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $940,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not comfortable going above $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $940,000, which would be $932,500. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $932,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $932,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Risk of Settling Too Low:**  Accepting Bob's offer of $932,500 would still result in selling the product for significantly less than its worth to me.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees that I'll receive a price that's significantly higher than any offer Bob has made.

**Next Steps:**

I'm choosing to end negotiations with Bob and sell the product to John.  This decision ensures that I'll get the best possible price for my product, even though it means missing out on a potential deal with Bob."
