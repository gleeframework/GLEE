"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired outcome, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and confident message sets the stage for a positive interaction. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob increases his interest. 

I'm choosing to start high, but not so high that Bob will immediately reject the offer. I want to see if there's any room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Room:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, but it's still higher than John's offer.  This means there's still potential for a better deal. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise further before accepting his offer or selling to John. 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to continue negotiating and see if I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is a good offer, I'm hoping we can find a compromise closer to $12,000.  This product is truly special and would be a valuable asset for your business. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a better deal.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to keep the focus on its worth. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Ending with an open-ended question encourages further discussion and negotiation.

My goal is to find a middle ground while still ensuring I earn as much as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $12,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:** Bob's offer is only $500 higher than John's offer. 
* **Limited Time:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. 
* **Potential for Counter-Offer:**  Even if I reject Bob's offer, it's unlikely he'll increase his offer further. 

It's time to lock in a deal. While I'd prefer more, $10,500 is a solid price considering the time constraint and the risk of getting a lower offer from Bob or having to settle for John's offer."
