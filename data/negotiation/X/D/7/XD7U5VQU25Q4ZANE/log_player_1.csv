This offer sets the initial price high, aiming to maximize potential profit.  It also leaves room for negotiation while still establishing a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but my budget for this product is limited. Could we perhaps negotiate a price closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still looking for something closer to $10,000. Could we possibly meet in the middle?

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that low. I'll try to negotiate a bit higher."
