Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves room for negotiation, as the product is worth $150 to Bob, but it's also significantly higher than my minimum of $100.  I'm confident this price will be attractive to Bob while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can secure a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $135. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I believe this price is still fair for both of us and increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
