"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. My initial offer is $1,100,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we bring the price down to $850,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $975,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. My new counteroffer is $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to move a bit on my end to reach a deal.  How about $912,500? This splits the difference between our last two offers and should allow us both to feel good about the agreement.",912500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $912,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. My new counteroffer is $920,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you.",920000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're really down to the wire here. I'm prepared to offer you $916,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to be mindful of my budget.  Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I may need to explore other options.",916000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to accept $916,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. My new counteroffer is $918,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you.",918000.0,Alice,9,
