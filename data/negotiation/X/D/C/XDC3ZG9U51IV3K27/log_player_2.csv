{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $730,000 is getting closer to my goal, it's still above my maximum budget. We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's worth continuing to try to negotiate a better price.  If Alice continues to be inflexible, I'll consider buying from John."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are now at the penultimate round, and Alice is still unwilling to meet my target price.  While I'm close to agreeing to her offer, I'm concerned that if I continue to negotiate, she may refuse to lower her price further, and I will be left with no choice but to pay $800,000 to John.  It's time to secure the product at a reasonable price by buying from John."
