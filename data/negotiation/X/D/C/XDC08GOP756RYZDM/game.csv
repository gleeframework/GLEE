"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a bit higher. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. This price still gives you a significant value compared to what you'd get elsewhere.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great value for you. Let's make this deal happen!",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're very close to a deal.  I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. This is a good price for both of us, and it would be a shame to miss out on this opportunity. Let's finalize this now!",10000.0,Alice,7,
