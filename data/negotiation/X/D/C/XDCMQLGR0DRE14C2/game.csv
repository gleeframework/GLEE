"I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think that's a fair price for this great product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $140 for the product. How about we meet in the middle again at $135?",135.0,Alice,5,
