"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my original asking price.  Would you be willing to go up to $9,000?  I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I hear you. $8,750 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,875? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good reflection of the product's value.",8875.0,Alice,5,
