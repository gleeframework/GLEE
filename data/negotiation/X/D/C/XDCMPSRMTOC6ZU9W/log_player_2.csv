"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still above the product's value to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my original asking price.  Would you be willing to go up to $9,000?  I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but her offer is still above Bob's target price and above the product's value to Alice. Bob can continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. There are still several rounds left, so there's time to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I hear you. $8,750 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,875? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,875 is a good deal for Bob. It's only $275 more than Bob's last counteroffer, and it's still below Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's also close to the value Alice places on the product. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid potentially prolonging negotiations further."
