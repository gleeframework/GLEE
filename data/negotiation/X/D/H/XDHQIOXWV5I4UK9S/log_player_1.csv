"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $150, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Enthusiastic message:** A positive and friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **No pressure:** I'm not putting any pressure on Bob to accept immediately. I'm letting him know it's his decision, which might encourage him to consider it more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was wondering if you could lower the price a bit? I think $130 would be more within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  This means there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Bob is truly serious about buying the product.  Rejecting his offer might push him to come closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic counteroffer:** In the next round, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves me some room to make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back to me. $130 is definitely closer to what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to go down to $140. Let me know if that works for you!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation friendly and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Leaving room for a deal:**  $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, so I can still earn a profit if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I really like the product, but I think we can still negotiate further. How about $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** Bob's offer of $135 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I'm confident I can make a reasonable profit.
* **Limited time:** We're already on Round 4, meaning I have a limited number of rounds left to close the deal.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or his counteroffers will continue to decrease. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
