{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It is above Bob's value but below mine, leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses a willingness to work with Bob to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial assessment, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to reject his counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a significant compromise.  It's a great price for a product that's worth so much to you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to walk away from this deal and sell to John for my minimum price.  I'm confident that I can find a better buyer in the future."
