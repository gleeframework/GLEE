"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so he starts by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Fairness:**  $10,500 is still a reasonable price for Alice, as it's more than her valuation of the product ($10,000). This shows Bob is serious about buying but also trying to negotiate. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  This counteroffer leaves room for a middle ground in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $11,500 is a very good price for Bob, significantly lower than what he'd pay John. 
* **Compromise:** Alice has shown willingness to negotiate and has met Bob halfway. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could try to get a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer secures a good deal with minimal risk."
