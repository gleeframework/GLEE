"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,700,000.  What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,700,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product, given its value to me.  Let's find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,600,000?  This allows us both to make a good deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, which is a fair price for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
