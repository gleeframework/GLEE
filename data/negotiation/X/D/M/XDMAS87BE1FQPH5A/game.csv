"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is a little too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference at $11,750?  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11750.0,Bob,4,
