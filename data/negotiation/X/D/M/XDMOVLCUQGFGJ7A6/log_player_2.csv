"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it!

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product for $8,200. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to her valuation, we're still a significant amount above it. Continued negotiation is worthwhile."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $8,200 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about we meet in the middle?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer the product for $8,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving very slowly, and we're still quite a bit above her valuation. We need to signal we're willing to walk away if we don't get a better price soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still too high for me. I'm getting close to the point where I need to consider other options unless we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7800
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but polite:** We acknowledge Alice's efforts but stand firm on our need for a lower price.
* **Introducing urgency:**  By mentioning ""other options,"" we signal that our time is valuable, and we're willing to walk away if necessary. 
* **Slight concession:** Moving to $7,800 shows some flexibility but maintains our position below $8,000.

This approach aims to encourage Alice to make a more substantial move without completely stalling the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has finally reached her product valuation. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and continuing to negotiate might lead to an impasse. Accepting the $8,000 offer secures a good deal for us."
