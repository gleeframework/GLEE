Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is appreciated, but I'm not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, I need to get closer to $1,100,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to meet me at that price?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's unlikely he'll reach a number I find acceptable. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
