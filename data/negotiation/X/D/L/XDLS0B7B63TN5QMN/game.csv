"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I have to consider the value the product brings to you, and I believe it's worth more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the benefits the product will bring to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
