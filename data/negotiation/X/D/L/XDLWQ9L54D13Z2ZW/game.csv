"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit too much.  How about we split the difference and settle on $140?  That's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you at $150, which is the maximum I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll consider it a fair deal.",150.0,Alice,5,
