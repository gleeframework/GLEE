"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's valued at $1,200,000, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, the price you're asking is quite high. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and I'm willing to explore options with Bob. Selling to John would be a guaranteed $1,200,000, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's try $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's potential and ensures a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for moving closer to a price we can both agree on.  How about $900,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, I believe we can still negotiate a better deal.  I have 6 rounds remaining and I'm confident that I can convince Bob to come up to a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 still doesn't reflect the full value of this product. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $950,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our interests and allows for a successful transaction."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting close to a price I can agree to.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is tempting, I believe I can still get a slightly better price. With only four rounds left, I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Selling to John would guarantee $1,200,000, but I'm still optimistic about reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $937,500.  This price is a fair compromise and ensures we both walk away satisfied with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 937500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm serious about buying this product, but I need you to be reasonable on the price.  My final offer is $930,000.  If you can't agree to that, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the final two rounds, and Bob's offer of $930,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'd like to continue negotiating,  the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is too high, and I don't want to lose the opportunity to sell the product to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
