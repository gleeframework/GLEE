"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the best I can do.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $10,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $11,500. This is as low as I can go.",11500.0,Alice,5,
