Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and Bob's valuation:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,500,000 (Bob's valuation) as possible. 
* **Secure the Sale:** Offering it at Bob's maximum price ($1,500,000) is risky, as he might try to negotiate lower. A price of $1,350,000 gives Bob a significant discount while still netting Alice a substantial profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John ($1,200,000). This allows her to aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice needs to be prepared to adjust her strategy accordingly."
