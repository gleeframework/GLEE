"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm  not setting an unreasonable price that would immediately lead to rejection.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to quickly gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value to John:**  John is willing to pay $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to earn.  
* **Strategic Play:**  Rejecting allows me to try and push Bob closer to my desired price in the next round. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm indicating that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low, even though it's a significant improvement from his initial rejection. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal or sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:**  I'm lowering my price but not drastically, demonstrating flexibility while maintaining my value.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reinforcing the product's worth to Bob, emphasizing that it's a good investment even at this price.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This counteroffer leaves room for potential negotiations in the following rounds.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground that's closer to my desired price while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. By making a reasonable counteroffer, I'm showing willingness to compromise, but also  keeping my options open to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,000 for the product. I really think it's worth it, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing it from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting close to my minimum of $15,000.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're already in round 4, and I have limited rounds left.
* **High Value to John:**  I can still sell to John for $15,000, so there's not much risk in accepting Bob's offer.

**Strategy:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and minimizes the risk of a negotiation breakdown. It's a strategic decision to secure a sale while still securing a reasonable profit."
