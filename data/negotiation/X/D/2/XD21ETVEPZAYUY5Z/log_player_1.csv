Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Offering it at $10,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  You can always lower the price, but you can't go higher than your initial offer. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have a limited amount of time or would prefer a quicker sale to Bob. If you have ample time and no immediate need to sell, you could potentially hold out for a higher offer from Bob."
