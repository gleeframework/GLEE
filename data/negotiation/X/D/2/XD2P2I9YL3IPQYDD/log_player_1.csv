Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. It's worth a lot more than that, but I want to start with a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can we meet in the middle?

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $120 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. $140 is still below my minimum, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can reach a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $140 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $155. This is a good deal for both of us, as it's fair for you and still allows me to get a decent price."", ""product_price"": 155}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  Bob's offers are getting closer, but we're running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting a lower price.  John's offer is the safest option."
