"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $175? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $200, but $175 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product. Can we meet in the middle?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $140 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $155. This is a good deal for both of us, as it's fair for you and still allows me to get a decent price.",155.0,Alice,5,
