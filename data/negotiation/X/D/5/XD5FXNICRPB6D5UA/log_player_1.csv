{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've set the initial price at $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.

**Strategy:**

This is a starting point. I'll observe Bob's reaction. If he rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation. If his offers get too low, I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John for the guaranteed $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum value, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial $15,000, but higher than his $12,000. I'll aim for a compromise that's still profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $12,000 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've countered with $13,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This demonstrates flexibility while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect for both of us. This builds rapport and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer seriously.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more attractive to Bob while still securing a price that's acceptable to me. If Bob still rejects, I'll carefully analyze his next counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing negotiations or if I should sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can still get a better price.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer one more time with a price that is slightly higher than his offer but still lower than my previous offer. I'll try to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. If Bob rejects again, I'll sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to make one final adjustment.  How about $12,500? This is a good compromise for both of us, and it allows you to acquire the product without going over your limit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $12,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway.
* **Message:** I've emphasized the ""compromise"" aspect to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. I've also reminded him of his budget constraint to subtly pressure him towards accepting. 

**Strategy:**

This is my final counteroffer. If Bob rejects it, I'll accept the guaranteed offer from John for $10,000. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept my final offer, earning me a higher profit than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $1,000 below my previous offer,  it's still too low for me.  I've already made several concessions and I don't want to risk further negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a better price with John.  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $10,000."
