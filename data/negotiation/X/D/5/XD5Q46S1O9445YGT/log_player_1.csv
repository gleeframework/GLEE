"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value of $8,000. This is a risky move but it gives me the potential to earn more.  We have 10 rounds to negotiate, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm rejecting his offer to see if I can push him a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,800.  This is still above Bob's initial value, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible.  It's a compromise that might get the deal done without having to risk going back and forth for several more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $200 less than my last counteroffer. I'm willing to accept this to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially reaching a lower price or even having to sell to John at my minimum value. It's important to weigh the potential gains against the risks in each round, and in this case, I think accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy."
