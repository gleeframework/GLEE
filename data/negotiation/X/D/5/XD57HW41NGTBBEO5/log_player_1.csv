**Reasoning:** 

Bob has been extremely firm on his valuation and has even threatened to walk away.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer. Accepting his offer at $1,750,000 is a loss compared to John's offer. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a fair price and avoids further negotiation risk."
