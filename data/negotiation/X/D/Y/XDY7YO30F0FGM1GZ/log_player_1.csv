Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential of this product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This would allow for a comfortable profit margin for you while still being a good deal for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
