{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It allows for some negotiation but still keeps the price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to maneuver. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent rounds, always keeping in mind John's offer of $1,000,000 as my fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $950,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I could accept and take a loss, it's worth trying to negotiate further. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I can potentially leverage the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay more, to incentivize Bob to come closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant concession, and it reflects my commitment to working with you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer but still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $775,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable threshold. I'm not yet at the point where I'd rather accept Bob's offer than sell to John.  I'll reject this offer and counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer. This will demonstrate flexibility while still maintaining a respectable negotiation position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop the price to $825,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
