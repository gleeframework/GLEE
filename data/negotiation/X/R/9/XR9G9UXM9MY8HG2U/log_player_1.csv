Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob values the product at ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, emphasizing the potential value to Bob. This is important to keep the negotiation flowing. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit, so I'm starting with a higher price. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down but always stay above my minimum.  John provides a safety net, ensuring I don't have to accept a price lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept a price that low. I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation going, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  This still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm counteroffering with $140, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150 but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to give away too much.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message positive and friendly, acknowledging Bob's interest and emphasizing the potential for a win-win situation.  

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's offer. By showing flexibility and communicating clearly, I hope to reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's closer to it than my previous counteroffer.  Considering that I can always sell to John for $150, accepting this offer still ensures a profit and allows me to close the deal with Bob.  

**Strategy:**

I'm prioritizing a quick sale and minimizing further negotiation.  Even though I could potentially get closer to my minimum price with more rounds, the risk of Bob walking away or me getting stuck in a drawn-out negotiation is higher. Accepting this offer gives me a solid profit and avoids potential complications."
