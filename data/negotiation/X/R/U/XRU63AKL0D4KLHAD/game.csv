"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd need to get at least $160 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $155 as a compromise. Would you be willing to accept that price?",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at $155. I'm willing to meet you at $160, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Would you be willing to meet me at $160?",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not willing to go below $160. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'd like to discuss some extras or discounts to sweeten the deal. Can we talk about what you can offer?",160.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm open to discussing extras or discounts, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give away the product for free. I can offer you a bundle deal that includes a one-year warranty and a free accessory. The price remains at $160, but I think this is a great value for you.",160.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I like the bundle deal you're offering, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to accept $155 and include the warranty and accessory in the deal?",155.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go back to the original price of $155. I'm willing to throw in an additional free accessory to sweeten the deal, but the price remains at $160. I think this is a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",160.0,Alice,9,

,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid $130 is a bit too low for me, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $160 and $130, which would be $145. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer.",145.0,Alice,11,
