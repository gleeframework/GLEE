Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a fair starting point.** It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **A friendly message:**  It's important to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Why this strategy is good:**

* **Potential for profit:**  $12,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for a profitable deal.
* **Flexibility:**  The starting offer allows for room to negotiate down if necessary, but still provides a significant profit margin.
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects, you can fall back on John's offer of $15,000. 

**Important Note:**  This is just a starting point. The best strategy will depend on Bob's reaction, your assessment of his willingness to pay, and your overall negotiation style."
