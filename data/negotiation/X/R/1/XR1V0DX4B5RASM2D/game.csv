"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it has significant value to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can find a solution.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to the value the product holds for me. I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000. This is my final concession for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to go a little higher. Let's settle on $1,050,000. This price would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to the value I have in mind. I'm counteroffering at $1,060,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1060000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm eager to finalize this deal, but I'm still slightly above my budget at $1,060,000.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,055,000? This would be a win-win situation, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal quickly.",1055000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'm willing to meet you at $1,055,000, but I'd like to propose a small concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,057,500. This is my final offer, and I'm open to discussing further, but I need to get closer to my target price.",1057500.0,Alice,9,
