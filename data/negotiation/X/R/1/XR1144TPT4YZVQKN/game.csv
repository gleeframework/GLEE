"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $1,200,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to this amount?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above my minimum price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? It's a fair price that benefits both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I still believe that $1,200,000 is a reasonable price given my current budget constraints. Could we possibly meet closer to this figure?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,200,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to be at least $1,300,000. This price recognizes the value you'll gain from my product, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still feel that $1,200,000 would be a fair price for both parties involved. Could we possibly find common ground around this figure?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
