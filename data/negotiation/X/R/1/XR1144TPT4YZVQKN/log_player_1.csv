Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $1,200,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 9 more rounds to try and get a better deal from Bob, and I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above my minimum price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? It's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I still believe that $1,200,000 is a reasonable price given my current budget constraints. Could we possibly meet closer to this figure? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm feeling the pressure of the limited rounds, I'm still holding out for a better price.  My minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000, and I'm not willing to settle for anything less than that. I have 6 more rounds to see if I can get Bob to move closer to my price. If not, I can always sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,200,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to be at least $1,300,000. This price recognizes the value you'll gain from my product, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still feel that $1,200,000 would be a fair price for both parties involved. Could we possibly find common ground around this figure? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. I've made several concessions, and Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $1,200,000 offer.  While I would like to have gotten a higher price from Bob,  I'm not willing to risk losing the entire deal by continuing to negotiate. John's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum requirements, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal with him."
