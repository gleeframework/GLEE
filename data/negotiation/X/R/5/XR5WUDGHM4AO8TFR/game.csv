,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $11,000 to make it worth my while. How about we settle on $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to $8,000, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at that level.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're firm on $8,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $11,000 to make it worth my while. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking to my offer of $8,000.  I believe that's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a deal that will benefit both of us.  Let's see if we can find a solution.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on $8,000, but I'm not willing to give up that much margin. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial deal at this price.",9000.0,Alice,7,
