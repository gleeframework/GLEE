# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $11,000 to make it worth my while. How about we settle on $10,500?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to $8,000, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at that level."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on $8,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $11,000 to make it worth my while. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking to my offer of $8,000.  I believe that's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a deal that will benefit both of us.  Let's see if we can find a solution."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on $8,000, but I'm not willing to give up that much margin. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. He has already made several counteroffers and Alice seems unwilling to drop below $9,000. With only three rounds left, it's unlikely Alice will accept Bob's $8,000 offer. It's better for Bob to take the guaranteed $8,000 deal from John."
