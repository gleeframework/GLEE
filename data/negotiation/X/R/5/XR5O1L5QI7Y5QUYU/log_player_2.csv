"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to make a deal that will benefit both of us. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident you'll see the returns on your investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is lower than the $1,000,000 you'd pay John. This means accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000.  Even though the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, it's still a good deal to save money."
