Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $8,000 and John will pay $12,000.  Starting with a higher price ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit than selling directly to John.
* **Gauge Interest:** The message aims to gauge Bob's interest without revealing Alice's minimum acceptable price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""open to discussing further"" signals to Bob that there's potential flexibility in the price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice doesn't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay (his reservation price). 
* There's a risk Bob might be turned off by the high initial price and refuse to negotiate. However, Alice always has the option to sell to John for her minimum acceptable amount."
