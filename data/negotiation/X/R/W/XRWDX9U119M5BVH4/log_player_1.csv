Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. Given its unique features, I'm offering it to you for $12,000."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level and give you an idea of how far he might be willing to go. 
* **John as Backup:** You always have the option to sell to John for $10,000, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is a significant increase from his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. There's room for further negotiation. I'll try to meet him somewhere in the middle while keeping in mind I have John as a guaranteed backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I value this product at a higher price point. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims for a compromise. It acknowledges Bob's offer while still striving for a price closer to my target.
* **Maintaining Value:**  By not drastically dropping my price, I'm reinforcing the value of my product. 
* **Leaving Room:** There's still a $1,500 gap between Bob's offer and my counteroffer, allowing space for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to counteroffer at $10,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $10,500 exceeds my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away. It's a solid offer, and I'm better off securing the deal now."
