Round 2

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $120 is still a bit low for me, considering my minimum is $100. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe the product is worth more.  I'll see if I can get him to budge further in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal for me. I've been able to negotiate a price higher than my minimum ($100) and it's only a few dollars below my desired price. It's also getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, so I want to avoid the risk of not being able to secure a sale."
