"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I need to sell for.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it lets me get closer to my target price. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That way, we can both feel good about the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
