Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $175. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum value of $150, and leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe Bob is likely to be willing to pay this amount, as it's still below the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is my minimum.  I don't want to risk losing the sale completely, and John is also offering $150. So, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice."
