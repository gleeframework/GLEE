"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you my product, which I know you've been interested in. It's a valuable asset that I believe can be incredibly beneficial for you.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,000,000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's worth and allows you a significant profit margin.  Consider this your chance to secure a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is tempting, you can do better. You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and you know John will sell it at that price. There's room for negotiation with Alice."
