"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable asset. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects the inherent worth of the product and the significant benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you reaching out, but $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering my value and the fact that I have other options. I hope you'll consider this offer. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the asset. I've already factored in market dynamics and potential alternatives in my pricing.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I'm confident this revised offer represents a fair deal for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,100,000 is still far too high.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. I'm serious about acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,850,000 is still too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my genuine interest, but I can't go any higher.  Let's reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
