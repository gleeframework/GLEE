"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $95 is too close to your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate a better price.
* **You have leverage:** You know John will sell it to you for $100, giving you a fallback option. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're willing to negotiate but need a more appealing price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. While it might seem aggressive, it leaves room for negotiation and gives you the best chance of reaching a price closer to your target. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message remains respectful and shows continued interest in the product.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting low, you establish your price range and encourage Alice to move closer to your desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $70 is too low for me. Could you do $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, but not enough:** Alice moving down to $85 is a good sign, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, it's still above your ideal price.
* **Room for negotiation:** You have a $15 buffer before reaching John's price, allowing you to counteroffer and potentially meet in the middle. 

By rejecting again, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer while keeping the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Alice's last price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $77 is a strong offer that still allows for some potential negotiation downwards while remaining a good deal for you.  
* **Time Consideration:**  By now, you've demonstrated your serious interest in the product. This offer, coupled with the potential time savings over finding a different seller, might be enough to convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $81? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gain vs. Risk:**  Alice is now only $4 away from your previous offer. Trying to haggle that extra amount might annoy her and risk her accepting a different offer.
* **Good Deal:** $81 is a good price, well below your maximum budget and John's alternative price.
* **Time Savings:** Accepting now saves you the time and effort of further negotiation and guarantees you the product."
