"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is better than $150, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to Alice's value of $100 as possible. Offering $105 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly cheaper than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is still cheaper than John's offer, it's not a great deal for Bob. He can likely negotiate a better price by continuing the process.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to try and find a middle ground.  Offering $115 is still a good deal for both parties.  Alice is getting a profit, and Bob is getting the product at a lower price than John's offer.  This is a good starting point for the next round of negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to Bob's value than John's offer, it's still not a great deal for him. There's still room to negotiate, and rejecting the offer keeps the process going.  Bob can likely get a better price if he continues to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. $120 is a fair price for both parties, considering Bob's budget and Alice's minimum acceptable price. By offering $120, Bob shows he's serious about closing the deal while still getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is getting dangerously close to John's price of $150. With only three rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation not yielding a better price is too high. It's better to secure the product from John at this point, even if it's slightly more expensive, to avoid potentially losing out completely."
