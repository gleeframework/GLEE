"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth at least $15,000 to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the potential value Bob gets by emphasizing the difference between my minimum value and the offered price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion, showing I'm flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $5,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting would be a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, he's shown interest in the product. There's room to negotiate a price that benefits both of us.
* **Maintaining Value:**  Selling to John immediately guarantees $15,000, but I want to see if I can get a higher price through negotiation with Bob. There are still 8 rounds left, giving me time to reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $5,000 is unfortunately too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $8,000.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterate Value:** I remind Bob of the value he'll get by highlighting the gap between the offered price and his perceived value.
* **Positive Framing:** I focus on the potential gain for Bob, rather than the loss for me, to encourage acceptance.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I end with a suggestion for finding ""middle ground,"" keeping the conversation open for future adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While $7,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired $15,000. Accepting would leave me with a significant loss.
* **Room for improvement:** Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still potential to reach a more favorable price.
* **Time is on my side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to explore further options and potentially reach a higher price. 
* **Maintaining flexibility:** Selling to John immediately guarantees $15,000, but I want to see if I can secure an even better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting closer! However, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. Would you consider $8,500?  This price would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a great deal, considering you value the product at $8,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise further while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Focusing on Shared Benefit:**  I emphasize that the offered price is a ""great deal"" for Bob, highlighting the shared benefit of the agreement.
* **Strategic Splitting:**  Offering to split the difference creates a sense of fairness and encourages Bob to consider a compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:** I remind Bob of the value he's receiving by referencing his own perceived value of the product."
