"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $130?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find a buyer who's willing to pay that.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $130 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135?  It's a fair price for both of us and I think we can close this deal.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to get this within my budget.  $135 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $132? I think that's a fair compromise that would work for both of us.",132.0,Bob,4,
