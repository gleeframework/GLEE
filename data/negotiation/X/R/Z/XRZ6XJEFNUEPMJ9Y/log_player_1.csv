Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I believe I can get closer to my desired value with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum threshold.  I'll continue to counteroffer in the hopes of finding a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $8,900.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8900}

**Reasoning:**

I'm still holding out for a higher price, as I am only a few hundred dollars away from my minimum threshold. I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet as I feel I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 7

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I've reached a point where I'm no longer confident I can secure a price that meets my minimum threshold. With only two rounds left, the risk of not finding a mutually agreeable price with Bob is too high.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired value."
