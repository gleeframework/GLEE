Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's valuation, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win.  It also sets a clear expectation for Bob to make a counter-offer if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! However, $100 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $60? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $60 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum valuation of $120.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $80? That way, we both get a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
