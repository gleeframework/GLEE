"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $15,500 for the product?",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. I can see you're willing to pay a premium for this product, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,500 and $13,000. How about $14,250 for the product?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While $14,250 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to land around $13,500. Would that work for you?",13500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $14,000 for the product? It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings",14000.0,Alice,7,
