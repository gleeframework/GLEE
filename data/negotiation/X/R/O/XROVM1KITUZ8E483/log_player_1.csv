{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a decent profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer, if any."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is too low for me.  While I'd rather sell to Bob than John, I'm not willing to give up so much profit. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still gives me a profit. I'm hoping this is a reasonable compromise that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, and selling to Bob still yields a better profit than selling to John. I'll accept his offer."
