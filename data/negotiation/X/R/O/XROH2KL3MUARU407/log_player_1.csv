Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $11,999. I think it's a great deal for something that will be very valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 11999} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Create Urgency:** By offering a high price with a slight discount, I create a sense of urgency. Bob knows I have other options (John) and might be less likely to negotiate further. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely,  this offer leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to counter-offer if he's desperate, allowing me to potentially earn even more."
