You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's always worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range that I believe is reasonable.  This is a strong opening move, as it shows I'm serious about negotiating but also willing to compromise.  I'm hoping Alice will be motivated to negotiate and come closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as I'm unlikely to get a lower price.  It's better to accept her offer now and secure the product."
