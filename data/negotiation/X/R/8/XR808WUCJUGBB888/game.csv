"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs, but $18000 is out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12000, which is my maximum.  This would still be a great deal for you considering its value to you is $15000.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your maximum, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $14000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $12000 and its value to me is $15000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
