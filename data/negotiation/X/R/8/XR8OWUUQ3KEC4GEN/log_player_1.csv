Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $125. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $80, it's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $125 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Considering the Alternative:**  Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150. Therefore, any price Bob agrees to above $150 is a win for Alice."
