Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strong starting point to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, we can then adjust our price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $900,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages him to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I will continue to negotiate with him, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired amount."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

I'm counter-offering at $850,000.  This is a significant concession, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also holding firm on the value of the product."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement that meets my needs.  It's time to take the guaranteed offer from John for $800,000."
