"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale. By rejecting this offer, you might prompt a counter-offer closer to her $8,000 value. You can always fall back on John's $12,000 offer if needed."
