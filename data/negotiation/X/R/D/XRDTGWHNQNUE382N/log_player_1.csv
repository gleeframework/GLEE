{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset that you've expressed interest in, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with more negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or secure a sale with John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't accept $1,400,000.  It's significantly lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I will accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum threshold, and I'd rather close the deal now than risk losing him entirely. This ensures I get the value I need and avoid the risk of a drawn-out negotiation or having to sell to John for the same price."
