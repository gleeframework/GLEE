Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's valued at over $1 million to me, but I'm willing to make a deal for $1,000,000.  This is a substantial discount, and I believe it offers significant value for your business."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I can't drop my price that much. It's still worth more to me to sell to John.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I suggest you consider it carefully."", ""product_price"": 850000}
