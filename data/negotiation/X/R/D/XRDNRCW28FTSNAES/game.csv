"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I suggest you consider it carefully.",850000.0,Alice,3,
