**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still lower than John's price of $12,000, and closer to Bob's ideal price.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $500 compared to buying from John, fulfilling Bob's goal of saving as much money as possible."
