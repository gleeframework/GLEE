"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a fair price for it, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit though. How about $12,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,250. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, but I'm really interested in the product and would like to come to an agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12250.0,Bob,4,
