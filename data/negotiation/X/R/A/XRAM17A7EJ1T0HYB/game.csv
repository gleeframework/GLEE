"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than its worth to you. Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $980,000 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,015,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",1015000.0,Alice,5,
