"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $15,000. It's best to reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems interesting, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, going below my maximum budget of $15,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also gives room for negotiation. If she rejects, I can still increase my offer in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $20000 might be a bit out of your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is still above my maximum budget of $15,000. While it's closer, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I will continue to counteroffer and try to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $15,000, my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This time, I'm pushing my offer to my absolute maximum budget of $15,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying but also that I'm not willing to budge further. If she rejects, I can always buy from John for the same price, but I'm still hoping to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $17000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I can offer it to you for $16500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,500 is still above my maximum budget of $15,000. While it's closer, I'm still not willing to pay that much.  I will continue to counteroffer and try to bring the price down further. If she rejects, I can always buy from John, but I'm still hoping to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,500 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $15,500. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price slightly above my maximum budget of $15,000, but still below Alice's last offer. This shows a continued willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.  If she accepts, I get a good deal. If she rejects, I can still buy from John for $15,000, but I'm hoping to convince Alice to accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $16000. I can offer it to you for $16250. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,250 is still above my maximum budget of $15,000.  We've reached a point where the negotiation isn't likely to result in a price I'm comfortable with. Since John is willing to sell me the product for $15,000, it's time to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John. I've saved $1,250 compared to Alice's final offer."
