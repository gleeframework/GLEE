"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, though, and I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is my best offer, as I've already got another deal lined up for $800,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you have another deal lined up, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario, allowing me to acquire the product while still giving you a profitable deal.  Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I think the product's value is worth more than that, especially considering the benefits it can bring to your business. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",950000.0,Alice,5,
