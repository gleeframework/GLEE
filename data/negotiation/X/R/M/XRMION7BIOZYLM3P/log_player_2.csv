"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,000,000 is above his maximum budget of $800,000, and he can get the product for a lower price from John.  It's best to try to negotiate with Alice and see if she's willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, though, and I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is my best offer, as I've already got another deal lined up for $800,000."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you have another deal lined up, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to lower the price further. It's worth risking another round of negotiations to see if Alice will budge more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario, allowing me to acquire the product while still giving you a profitable deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I think the product's value is worth more than that, especially considering the benefits it can bring to your business. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While there's still room for negotiation, Bob is nearing the end of his allotted rounds and it's getting risky to continue. It's better to secure the product from John at his guaranteed price of $800,000."
