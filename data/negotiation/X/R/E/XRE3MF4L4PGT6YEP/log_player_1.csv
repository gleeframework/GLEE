"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is fair for both of us.  It's above my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested, but I'd offer $85. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $95 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's see if we can strike a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's significantly closer to my desired price than John's offer, and it's within the range I'm willing to accept.  I'll take it and close the deal."
