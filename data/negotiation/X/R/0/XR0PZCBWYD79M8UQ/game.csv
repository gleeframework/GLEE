"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1500000, which reflects its significant worth. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the price I've found from another seller. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I acknowledge your offer, it falls short of the value I see in this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000, reflecting a compromise on my side. This price still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair reflection of its unique potential.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the price I've found from another seller. I'm hoping we can meet at this price, as it's the most I'm willing to pay.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
