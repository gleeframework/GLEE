Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its true value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($2,000,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize my profit.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message makes it clear that I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts and potentially negotiating.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Information:** I don't know anything about Bob's financial situation or his perceived value of the product. This makes it risky to start too high, as I might immediately lose the deal.
* **John's Offer:** I have a backup option with John, which allows me to set a lower limit on what I'm willing to accept.  If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away and sell to John.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. If he rejects the offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum price ($1,500,000), it's still below what I want to get for the product.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation. I can potentially get closer to my desired price of $2,000,000 by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding the ""Sell to John"" Option:**  I'm not yet ready to settle for the $1,500,000 offer from John. There's a chance I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my original offer of $2,000,000.  My goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $1,800,000 is a good starting point, I need to stay closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $2,000,000 to $1,900,000.
* **Maintain Value:** I'm still holding onto a significant portion of my desired profit, which is important considering the product's true value.
* **Focus on Middle Ground:** I'm emphasizing the idea of finding a ""middle ground"" to encourage Bob to meet me halfway.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I will carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I've successfully negotiated a good price.
* **Prepare for Further Negotiation:** If he rejects, I'll need to consider my next steps, potentially lowering my price further or opting for the $1,500,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1850000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:**  Bob's offer of $1,850,000 is only $50,000 away from my previous counteroffer of $1,900,000. This is a significant improvement from his initial offer of $1,800,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob altogether, especially since he's already indicated he's at his budget limit.
* **Solid Return:** Accepting this offer will still give me a good return on the product, much higher than John's offer of $1,500,000.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale.  I've successfully negotiated a price that's within my desired range and secured a sale."
