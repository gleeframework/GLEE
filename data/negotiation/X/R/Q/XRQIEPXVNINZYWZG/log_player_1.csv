Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, giving you a baseline.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate with Bob for a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 is:
    * Significantly above Bob's valuation, creating perceived value.
    * Leaves room for Bob to counter-offer while still securing you a profit above your guaranteed sale.
* **Alternative Secured:** If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your desired price."
