"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least $15,000 to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her perceived value, you have a better alternative. You can buy the product from John for $10,000, saving you $2,000. Your goal is to save as much money as possible, making John's offer the best choice."
