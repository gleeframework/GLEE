"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",150.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $140, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",120.0,Bob,4,
