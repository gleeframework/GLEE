Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm going to counter with a higher price in the next round. I'm still hopeful we can reach an agreement, but I'm prepared to sell to John if the deal with Bob falls through."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer,  $1,275,000 is still too low. I'm not willing to sell at a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counter with a final offer in the next round, but if he doesn't come up to my price, I'm going to sell to John."
