"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if you're interested.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
