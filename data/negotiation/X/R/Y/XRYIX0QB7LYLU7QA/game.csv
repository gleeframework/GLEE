"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify paying $15,000 for it. My counteroffer would be $10,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $10,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $12,500 is a bit high for me. Considering my budget and the current market value, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000.",11000.0,Bob,4,
