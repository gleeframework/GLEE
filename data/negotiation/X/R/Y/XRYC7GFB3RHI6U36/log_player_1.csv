"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it also leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Unfortunately, Bob has rejected my last offer. Although I've come down significantly from my initial price, it seems we haven't reached an agreeable price point.

While it's not my ideal outcome, it ensures I don't lose any money and keeps my financial goals on track."
