"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  I believe this price is still fair given the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $875,000? This would allow us both to get a good deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there with $875,000.  Let's try $890,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we're both trying to come to an agreement. What do you say?",890000.0,Alice,5,
