Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  I believe this price is still fair given the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $875,000? This would allow us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there with $875,000.  Let's try $890,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we're both trying to come to an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 890000}
