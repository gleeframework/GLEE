"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a fair price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above my budget. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer, but $18,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $8,000. Would you be open to negotiating a price closer to that range?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can meet you halfway at $12,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $12,000 is still significantly higher than my budget and John's offer. I'll counteroffer again and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $12,000 is still quite a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $9,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in the product."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad to see you're serious about the product. However, $9,000 is still below my target. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I need to meet my minimum value. I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping you can meet me at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is barely budging, and $13,000 is still a long way from both my budget and John's offer. I'll try one more time to negotiate, but I'm ready to walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't significantly reduce her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still pushing my budget. I'm willing to offer a final price of $10,000. This is a substantial amount, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If you're not able to accept this, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to meet my minimum value. I can offer you a price of $14,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping you can see the value in the product at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear that Alice is not willing to come close to my budget. Even at her ""final"" offer of $14,000, the price is still significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
