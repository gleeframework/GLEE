Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer, but $18,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $8,000. Would you be open to negotiating a price closer to that range?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $12,000 is still quite a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $9,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
