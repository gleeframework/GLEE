"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're willing to pay $7000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to make one more concession.

"I've made a lot of concessions, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8000. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet me at $8000, but if not, I'll have to consider other options. This is my last offer.",8000.0,Alice,7,
