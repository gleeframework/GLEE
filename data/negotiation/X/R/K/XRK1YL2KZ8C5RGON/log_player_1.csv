Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a starting offer that is significantly higher than your minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It signals to Bob that you are serious about selling, but you also value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, and I believe I can get a better price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility, but also maintains my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my desired price. While it's still below my initial offer, it's a significant improvement from his previous offer. Selling to John would only net me $1,000,000, so accepting Bob's offer is the best choice at this point."
