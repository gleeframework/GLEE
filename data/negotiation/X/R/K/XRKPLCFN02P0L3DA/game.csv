"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you and significantly higher than what I'd receive from another buyer.  Let me know what you think!",14500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $14,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $13,800? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and still leaves plenty of room for you to get a great value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13,800 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for $13,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and lets us both walk away happy. What do you say?",13500.0,Bob,4,
