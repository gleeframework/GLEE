"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $10000 for your product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10500, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to look elsewhere.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I am willing to pay $9500 for your product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be budget-conscious, but $9500 is simply not viable for me.  To make this work, I need to be at $10200. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if you're ready to finalize the deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I am willing to pay $9800 for your product.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000, which is my minimum.  If you're truly interested, this is our final offer.",10000.0,Alice,7,
