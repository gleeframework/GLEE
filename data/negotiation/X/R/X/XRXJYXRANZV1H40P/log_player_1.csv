"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This allows for room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport and encourage a successful negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to him to make the offer more enticing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $10000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $10,000 is my absolute minimum and doesn't offer me any profit.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's initial offer was low, he is clearly interested in the product. I believe there's room for a counteroffer to get closer to a more profitable price. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John is only a last resort, as it gives me no profit. I prefer to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but Not Too Much:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering the price, but I'm still ensuring a small profit. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining my value.
* **Finality:**  I've emphasized that this is my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and pressure. This can encourage Bob to accept.
* **Alternative Options:**  I'm reminding Bob that I have other options (selling to John) to make him realize that he may lose the opportunity if he doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I am willing to pay $9500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Negotiation Continues:** While Bob's offers are getting closer, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a higher price if I continue.
* **John is a Safety Net:**  I can still sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not in a desperate position to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be budget-conscious, but $9,500 is simply not viable for me.  To make this work, I need to be at $10,200. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if you're ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise with Justification:** I'm offering a slight compromise to $10,200, which is still above my minimum but acknowledges Bob's budget concerns.  I'm also justifying the price by reminding him of the value he perceives in the product. 
* **Sense of Finality:**  I'm using language like ""final"" and ""ready to finalize"" to subtly emphasize that we're nearing the end of negotiations.
* **Pressure and Incentive:**  By suggesting a finalization, I'm putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.  This also encourages him to accept before he might consider other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I am willing to pay $9800 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting would mean a loss.
* **Negotiations Are Getting Closer:** While Bob's offers are getting closer, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a higher price, potentially reaching $10,000 or even slightly above.
* **John is a Safety Net:** I have the option of selling to John for $10,000, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer just yet. There's no need to rush into a deal that doesn't meet my minimum requirement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000, which is my minimum.  If you're truly interested, this is our final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality with a Twist:** I'm emphasizing that this is a ""final"" offer, but this time, I'm suggesting a ""meeting halfway"" to appear more flexible and reasonable, making it more tempting for Bob to accept.
* **Meeting Minimum:** This is my minimum price, ensuring I don't take a loss.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The final offer language creates a sense of urgency and pressure, pushing Bob towards a decision.  
* **John as a Backup:**  John is still a safety net if Bob rejects the offer."
