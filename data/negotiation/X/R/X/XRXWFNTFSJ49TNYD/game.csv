"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This price still gives us both a fair deal. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is my absolute minimum. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $92. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",92.0,Bob,6,
