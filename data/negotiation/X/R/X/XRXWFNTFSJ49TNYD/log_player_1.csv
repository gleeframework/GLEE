{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Message:**  I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **First Round Strategy:**  In the first round, I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I believe I can secure a better price.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** By rejecting the offer, I signal to Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price. It might encourage him to increase his offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This price still gives us both a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's still higher than my minimum acceptable price, but closer to Bob's offer.

* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive to encourage Bob to continue negotiating."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is my absolute minimum. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with my absolute minimum price, signaling that I'm serious about getting a deal, but also willing to compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $92. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Is this something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob is trying to be more flexible, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's Offer:** I've already reached the point where John's offer is higher than any offer I'm likely to get from Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price. 

I'm choosing to sell to John because it offers a secure and profitable outcome."
