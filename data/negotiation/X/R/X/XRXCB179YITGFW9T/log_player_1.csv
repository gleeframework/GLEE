Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone can encourage Bob to negotiate further. 
* **Justification:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to me, which might encourage Bob to see it as more valuable. 

This approach balances my desire for a good price with the potential for negotiation and the need to avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** I believe there's room for further negotiation with Bob, as he's already shown interest in the product.  
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:** Selling to John immediately would guarantee $150, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.

This approach seeks to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me while still being within a reasonable range for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially when John is offering $150.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries a risk of Bob walking away, but the potential reward of a higher price is too tempting to ignore. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $95 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $100.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but that's my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  I'm framing this offer as my final one, putting pressure on Bob to accept. 
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a small increase from my last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Direct approach:** I'm being direct and clear about my expectations, avoiding any ambiguity.

This approach aims to push Bob towards accepting a price that's more favorable to me while still leaving some room for potential negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $92 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Even with his ""final"" offer of $92, Bob is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is a risk. There's no guarantee that he'll accept a higher price, and I'm losing time and potentially missing out on other opportunities.
* **Guaranteed value:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is well above my minimum and a significantly better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.

While I'd ideally like to get a higher price, the guaranteed $150 from John is the most sensible option at this point. It minimizes risk and maximizes my potential earnings."
