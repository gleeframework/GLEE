Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a high starting point, but it allows me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob is truly interested in the product and might be willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if I should simply sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price, and even lower than the guaranteed price from John. I need to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price, but still aiming for a significant profit.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and will be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."

Bob's offer is the same as what John is offering. While I'd prefer to get more,  I'm not willing to risk further negotiations. Selling to John guarantees me the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
