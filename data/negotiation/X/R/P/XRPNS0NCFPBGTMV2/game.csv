"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $900000. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While the product sounds interesting, $900000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it, but I'm not sure I can go higher. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my initial target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $750000. How about we try $825000? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm feeling comfortable at $800000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825000 and $800000. How about we try $812500? It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to get closer to a deal.",812500.0,Alice,5,
