Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While the product sounds interesting, $900000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it, but I'm not sure I can go higher. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm feeling comfortable at $800000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.
