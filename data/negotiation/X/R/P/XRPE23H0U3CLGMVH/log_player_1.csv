Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
