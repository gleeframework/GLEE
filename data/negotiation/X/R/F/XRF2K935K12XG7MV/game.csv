"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair offer.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, considering its value and features. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $17,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $11,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $11,000 falls short of what I can accept.  I'm willing to make one more move to $15,000. This is my bottom line, reflecting the absolute lowest price I can offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective on the product's value, Alice, but $15,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $13,500. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. Can you consider this revised offer?",13500.0,Bob,6,
