"Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500, but that's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get at least $10,500 for it. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,250. This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to sell to someone else if we can't reach an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $9,750. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from someone else.",9750.0,Bob,6,
