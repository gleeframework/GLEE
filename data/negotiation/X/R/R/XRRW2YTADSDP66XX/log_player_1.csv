{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I think this is a fair price given its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while also potentially securing a decent profit.  I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation, hoping to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500, but that's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get at least $10,500 for it. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
``` 

I'm trying to find a compromise by meeting him halfway. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target and I'm not desperate. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,250. This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to sell to someone else if we can't reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
``` 

I'm putting a bit more pressure on Bob by stating this is my final offer. I'm also reminding him that I have another buyer waiting in the wings, which might encourage him to reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $9,750. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from someone else. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has been insistent on his price and I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
