Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", ""product_price"": 1500000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, but that doesn't mean he wouldn't be willing to pay more if he perceives it as valuable and scarce.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A high initial offer allows you to negotiate down if necessary while still aiming for a price above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's financial situation or negotiating style beyond his valuation of the product."
