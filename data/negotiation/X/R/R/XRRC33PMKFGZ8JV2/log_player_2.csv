Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, $800,000 is quite a ways off from what I can accept. This product offers significant value, and to be fair to both of us, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,250,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we're getting close. I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, my absolute lowest price on this is $1,175,000. I'm firm on this, but I believe it's a fair offer that lets us both walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has revealed her absolute lowest price is $1,175,000. This is still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a price that's more beneficial than John's offer.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed better deal."
