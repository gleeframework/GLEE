Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product's value, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the highest he's willing to go, and it's still below my minimum. I can get my desired price from John without further negotiation."
