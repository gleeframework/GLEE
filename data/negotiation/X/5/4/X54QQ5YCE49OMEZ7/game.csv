"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500.  Would that be feasible?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $10,500, but I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I can tell we're both motivated to make a deal. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,750 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",11250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, it seems like we're nearing the limit of what we can both agree on.  I'm willing to offer a final price of $10,600.  If this doesn't work, I'll likely have to explore other options.",10600.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to make a final offer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,600. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",11200.0,Alice,9,
