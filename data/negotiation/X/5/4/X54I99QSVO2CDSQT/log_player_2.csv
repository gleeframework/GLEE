Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $950000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to stay above $1000000 to make this deal worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000?  I believe this price still represents a great value for you, given the potential of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.
