"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1300000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
