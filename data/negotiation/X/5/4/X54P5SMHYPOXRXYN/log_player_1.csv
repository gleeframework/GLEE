Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I believe is worth a significant investment. Given its value, I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this price reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is still worth more to Bob than to John, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me a chance to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
