Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down in price, but she's unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000. At this point, it makes more sense to take John's offer of $1,200,000. This guarantees you get the product at the best possible price for you, without the risk of further negotiation with Alice failing."
