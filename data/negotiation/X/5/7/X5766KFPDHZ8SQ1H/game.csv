"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is a bit high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the product's value.  However, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,000,000. This still reflects a considerable discount.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but that price remains outside my budget.  I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need us to find a more realistic middle ground. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about finding a solution, and I appreciate that. While $850,000 is closer, it's still a substantial difference for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. How about $950,000? This is my final offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,
