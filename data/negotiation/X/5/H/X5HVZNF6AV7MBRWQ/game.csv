"I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $900,000. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your desire to find a fair price, the value of this product is substantial and non-negotiable to that degree.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has significant value, but I still think $1,500,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'd like to propose a slight concession: I'll pay the full $1,200,000, but I'd like you to throw in some additional support or services to sweeten the deal. Can you consider this revised offer?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for additional value.  However, I believe my final offer of $1,350,000 represents a fair price for the product's inherent worth. I'm firm on this number. If you're unable to meet it, I may need to explore other options.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
