Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount above my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get a higher price than John is offering, but I don't want to scare Bob away with an unrealistic initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to my initial offer, but still allows room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is too low.  I'm not willing to go that low, and it's clear that we're too far apart in our valuations.  Rather than risk further negotiation, it's time to accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,200,000.  This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price, and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower price."
