Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love! I'm initially asking for $12,000, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and am interested in purchasing it. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $8,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired value by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9,500. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price.  While I would prefer to get even closer to $10,000, I'm concerned about potentially losing the deal altogether.  Since John is willing to pay $10,000, accepting Bob's offer at $9,500 ensures a sale and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
