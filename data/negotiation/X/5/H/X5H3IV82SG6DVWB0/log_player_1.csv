"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is a significant amount for Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly and positive, emphasizing a ""win-win"" situation.
* **Room for Counteroffers:**  This offer allows for multiple rounds of negotiation, giving me a chance to see if Bob is truly interested and explore his price range.

**Important Note:**  I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't go well. This serves as my fallback option and allows me to be more assertive in my pricing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and try to get closer to my desired price.
* **John is the safety net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 at any point, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's low offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by dropping my price, but still staying significantly above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Reiterate the value:**  I emphasize the product's value to justify my price, reminding Bob that it's worth more than he initially offered.
* **Open the door for further negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to respond and potentially continue the negotiation.  This keeps the conversation going.

**Important Note:**  My goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John. This allows me to be strategic and potentially secure a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement at this price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob is putting pressure on me, I believe there's still room for a counteroffer. He's shown interest, and the ""walk away"" threat doesn't necessarily mean he will leave. 
* **John is my safety net:**  I can still sell to John for $12,000, which allows me to remain assertive and negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:** 

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer, potentially closer to Bob's offer, but still well above my minimum threshold. The goal is to gauge Bob's commitment to the deal and find a middle ground that benefits both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $8,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering you the product for $9,000. This is a fair price, considering its value, and it leaves room for both of us to walk away with a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising but maintaining value:**  I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum price point. This demonstrates a willingness to meet him halfway while maintaining the product's value.
* **Emphasizing the win-win:**  I reiterate the ""fair price"" concept and highlight the benefits for both parties. This is crucial for reaching a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Putting the ball in Bob's court:**  I end with a question to encourage Bob's response and keep the negotiation flowing.  

**Important Note:**  I'm getting closer to Bob's price but still leaving some room for negotiation. My fallback option with John provides me with the confidence to hold firm to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'm getting close to walking away. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250. Can you live with that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $8,250 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Pressure tactics:** Bob is using pressure tactics by threatening to walk away, but I'm not convinced he will.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I still believe there's room for negotiation. I can try a counteroffer closer to his proposal, but not quite at his price.
* **John is my safety net:**  I can still sell to John for $12,000, giving me the leverage to hold firm and avoid a rushed decision. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, likely closer to $8,500, to see if Bob is truly willing to walk away.  If he's serious, I can always sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  $8,250 is closer, but it's still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $8,750. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a distance from my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Fair Compromise:** I emphasize that this price is a fair compromise, giving both of us a good deal. 
* **Keeping the door open:** I end with a question to keep the negotiation flowing and see if Bob is willing to budge. 

**Important Note:**  I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, so I need to strike a balance between staying firm on my price and finding a solution that works for both of us.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,750. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but I'm not going any higher than that. Can you accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has shown some flexibility, $8,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Limited negotiation rounds remaining:**  We are down to the final two rounds, and I'm not confident that I can secure a better deal with Bob.
* **John provides a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a profitable outcome. It's a wiser decision than risking another round of negotiation with Bob, especially given the pressure he's putting on me.

**Conclusion:**

While I prefer to close deals with everyone happy, the reality of the situation requires me to choose the option that maximizes my earnings. Selling to John ensures that I achieve my minimum target price and avoids the risk of potentially losing out on a better deal."
