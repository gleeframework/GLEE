Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $16,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems pretty firm on staying above $16,000.  At this point, it's unlikely she'll go down enough to make it worth continuing the negotiation. Buying from John at $15,000 guarantees you get the product at your target price."
