Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a discounted price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $100, so offering it above that creates a potential profit margin.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $140 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
