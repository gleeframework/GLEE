Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Open and friendly:** The message is friendly and open-ended, encouraging Bob to respond and start the negotiation.
* **Focus on value:** I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing too much, which can help generate interest. 

This approach aims to maximize my profit while also allowing for a potential back-and-forth negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I was hoping to pay less than $100. Could we negotiate a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get more. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation. Bob is interested, and I can likely find a price between $80 and my initial $100 offer. 
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John for $80 is the safe option, but I'd rather try to get a better price if possible.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility while staying above my minimum.
* **Clear and concise:** I'm clear about my new price, making it easy for Bob to understand and respond.
* **Continuing the conversation:**  My message encourages Bob to continue the negotiation and keeps the dialogue open.

This approach aims to find a price that's acceptable to both of us while ensuring I get more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm still looking to pay closer to $80. Would you be able to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I could try to get a bit more, I'm at a point where further negotiation might be time-consuming and could risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Avoiding John:**  While selling to John is a guaranteed $80, accepting Bob's offer nets me $5 more, which is worth the risk at this point.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a price that's satisfactory while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
