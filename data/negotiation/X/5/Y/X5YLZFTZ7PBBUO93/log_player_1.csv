{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

This is a starting point.  Since I know the product is worth at least $150 to me, I'm opening with that price.  If Bob rejects, I'll need to consider whether to lower my price or sell to John for the guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that $60 is low, but $120 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we split the difference and do $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept anything below $100. I'll counter with a lower price than my previous offer, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm open to negotiating, but $90 is still too low for me.  Let's meet at $100. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the value."", ""product_price"": 100}
