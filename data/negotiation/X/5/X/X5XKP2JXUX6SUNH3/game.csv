"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. How about we try $95? I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget to stick to, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we try $105? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to go up to $98, but I was thinking more along the lines of $98.50 would be a sweet spot for me. Would you be willing to meet me there?",98.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to meet you at $98.50. I'm thinking more along the lines of $108. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to make sure it's worth my while.",108.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that $108 is a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to meet you at $99, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",99.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to give up yet, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $100, but I need to make it worth my while. How about we meet exactly at $100, and I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",100.0,Alice,9,
