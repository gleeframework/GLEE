"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be of significant value to you. I understand its worth to you is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to sell it for a price that leaves room for both of us to benefit.  My offer is $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows you to acquire a valuable asset while ensuring I receive a profitable outcome. Please consider this offer carefully.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
