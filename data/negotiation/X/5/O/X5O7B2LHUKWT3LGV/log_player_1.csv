Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's slightly below your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a fair price considering the product's worth to Bob. By offering a message with it, you show you're interested in making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is closer to your minimum, you still have a potential buyer in John who's willing to pay $150.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. While $130 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $135.  It's a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $125. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is below your minimum acceptable price of $150.  While you could continue negotiating, John is a guaranteed sale at your minimum price. It's more efficient to sell to John now and avoid further negotiation."
