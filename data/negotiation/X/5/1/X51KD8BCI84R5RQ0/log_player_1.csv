"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming to anchor the negotiation high, closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than our minimum ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $1,300,000 price provides a buffer for negotiation while still securing a significant profit.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The message is designed to open a dialogue and understand Bob's initial reaction to a high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant profit, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob's offer indicates he's willing to pay significantly more than our minimum. Rejecting his offer allows us to counter and aim for a price closer to $1,100,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. How about we meet halfway at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's true worth and ensures a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $1,100,000, we're meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($900,000) and our initial ask ($1,300,000). This tactic often feels fair to both parties.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price without directly rejecting Bob's offer. 
* **Positive Language:**  We're using phrases like ""mutually beneficial deal"" to maintain a collaborative tone and keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I can do $975,000. This offer reflects a fair price while acknowledging the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concessions:** Bob's offer only increased by $75,000, signaling he may have more room to move. 
* **Profitable Still:** We can likely negotiate a price closer to $1,000,000 which remains a very strong profit margin.
* **Time Remaining:** We still have several rounds to attempt to secure a better deal before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. Let's aim for a win-win. How about $1,050,000?  This recognizes the value while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a more significant concession this round, dropping $50,000, to show Bob we're willing to move towards a deal. 
* **Holding Firm:** However, the $1,050,000 price point keeps us above the $1,000,000 mark, which is a good target based on Bob's previous offers.
* **Building Rapport:** We're emphasizing a ""win-win"" and acknowledging Bob's potential budget limits to maintain a positive tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $1,000,000? This offer represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Our Target:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets our goal of securing a price well above our minimum and represents a strong profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we could push for slightly more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk Bob might reduce his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a great deal. 
* **Time Efficiency:** We've reached a favorable agreement relatively quickly, allowing us to move on to other potential deals."
