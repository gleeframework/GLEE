"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,100,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, and it's certainly better than the $1,200,000 I could get from another buyer. Let me know your decision, and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is under your maximum budget, you know John will sell you the same product for $1,000,000.  It makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $100,000."
