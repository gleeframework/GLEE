Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $12,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a significantly higher price ($12,000) than my minimum ($8,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This creates room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** I've included a brief message highlighting the product's value, which might make Bob more receptive to the high price. 
* **Backup Plan:** I know I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price closer to my desired range.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob might be willing to pay a premium. If I knew Bob was extremely price-sensitive, I might start lower.
* **Negotiation Skills:** This is just the opening offer. I need to be prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially lower the price if he objects."
