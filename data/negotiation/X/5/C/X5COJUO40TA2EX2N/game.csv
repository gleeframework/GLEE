"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Given its value to you, I'm willing to pay $8,500. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This reflects the product's value while still offering you a good deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $9,000 is still a bit high. Let's meet halfway between our last offers at $8,750.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. I'm confident we can close this deal if we're both willing to compromise a bit.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,750 is closer to a fair price, I'm still seeking something a bit higher.  Would you consider $8,900? I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll gain from the product while acknowledging your budget concerns.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $8,900 is still a little above my comfort zone.  Let's split the difference one last time and go with $8,825.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a reasonable deal.  I'm committed to closing this deal, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",8825.0,Bob,6,
