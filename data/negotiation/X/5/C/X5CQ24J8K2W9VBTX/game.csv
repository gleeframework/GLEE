"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. Is this something you'd be interested in?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $150? It's the minimum I'm willing to sell it for, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get at least $140 out of this deal. How about we meet in the middle of our last two offers at $130? It's the lowest I'm willing to go.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offer, so I'll offer $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $127.50, which is just a tiny bit higher than your last offer. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",127.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $127.50 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offer, so I'll offer $124.75. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",124.75,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle on this one. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $128. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm willing to compromise a bit more. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",128.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $128. I'm willing to make one last offer of $122.50. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",122.5,Bob,10,
