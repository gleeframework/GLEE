"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $20,000 was a bit high, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $16,500? This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.",16500.0,Alice,5,
