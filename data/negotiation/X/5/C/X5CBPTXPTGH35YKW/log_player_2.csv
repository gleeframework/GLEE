"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is too high. It's more beneficial to negotiate and try to lower the price. Buying from John right now is the least desirable option as it doesn't allow for any potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Starting with a significantly lower offer ($12,000) leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* I'm aiming to stay well below Alice's asking price while still offering a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $20,000 was a bit high, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $16,000 is still more than what John offers. There's room for further negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

*  I'm proposing a price exactly between Alice's previous offer ($16,000) and my previous counteroffer ($12,000). This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal. 
* This price point keeps me competitive with John's offer while potentially allowing me to secure the product for less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $16,500? This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems stuck on a price higher than John's offer.  It's unlikely she'll go down to $15,000 or less, and continuing the negotiation might be fruitless. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John to secure the product at a reasonable price."
