"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While $11,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $11,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you've stated, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,800 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to sell. I believe there's still room for a bit more negotiation. I'll see if I can get him to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close to a deal, but $11,800 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,200.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit. Let's finalize this now."", ""product_price"": 12200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $12,100 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,100

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close to my minimum and I'm concerned about running out of time. It's also higher than what John is offering, making it a good decision."
