"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  This gives me some room to negotiate and also signals to Bob that I'm confident in the value of my product.  I'm hoping to get a deal quickly, but I'm also prepared to negotiate for several rounds if necessary.  If Bob rejects my offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing negotiations or if I should sell to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $100. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'd like to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a great price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm going to test the waters with a lower counteroffer, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle.  $140 is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still allows me to make a profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as time is running out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate it. I would like to counter with an offer of $120. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price. I want to see if I can push for a bit more, but I'm getting close to the point where selling to John might be the better choice.  I'll counteroffer with a slightly higher price to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 still isn't quite there for me.  Would you consider $130?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

I'm going to try one more time to get closer to my target price before I consider selling to John.  $130 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value in it. If he rejects, I'm going to seriously consider selling to John as we're getting close to the end of our rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and would like to counter with $125. I hope this is a price you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $125 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price,  we're running out of time, and  I don't want to risk ending up with a deal that's below my minimum.  John's offer of $150 is guaranteed and ensures I get the price I want.  I'll go with the sure thing and sell to John."
