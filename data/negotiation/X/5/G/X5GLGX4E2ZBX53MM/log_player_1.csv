Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $850,000 is still lower than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($900,000), I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round.
