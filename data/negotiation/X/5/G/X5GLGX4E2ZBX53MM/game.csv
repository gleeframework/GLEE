"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a bit more than $850000. I'm counteroffering at $880000. This is my best price, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",880000.0,Alice,3,
