"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique item that's worth $1000000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's a significant gap between her offer and her actual value. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and the potential to secure a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a bit more than $850000. I'm counteroffering at $880000. This is my best price, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $880,000 is still a good deal for Bob.  It's lower than what John is selling for and closer to Bob's desired price.  There's a good chance that further negotiation will result in a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will walk away.  Accepting the offer minimizes the risk and ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
