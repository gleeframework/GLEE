Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit out of your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, $6,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and make a counteroffer of $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, which is still a good profit for me, but also a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

```

At this point, Alice's offer of $8,500 is higher than John's offer of $8,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a price lower than John's.  Therefore, it makes the most sense to buy from John at this stage."
