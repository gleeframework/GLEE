"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit out of your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, $6,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and make a counteroffer of $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you working with me. While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $7,000?  I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, which is still a good profit for me, but also a fair compromise. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
