"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer.  While $900,000 is a respectable figure, this product truly delivers exceptional value, and I believe my initial offer of $1,100,000 is more reflective of that.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This offer stands as a testament to my belief in the product's worth and my desire for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you believe the product has exceptional value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,050,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It seems we are getting closer. To demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,000,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects the value I place on a successful outcome for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay up to $980,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",980000.0,Bob,6,
