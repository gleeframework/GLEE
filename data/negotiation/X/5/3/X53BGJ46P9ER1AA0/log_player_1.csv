Round 2
Bob's offer:

While $900,000 is a respectable figure, this product truly delivers exceptional value, and I believe my initial offer of $1,100,000 is more reflective of that.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This offer stands as a testament to my belief in the product's worth and my desire for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently undervaluing the product and his counteroffers are not increasing significantly.  While he might eventually be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000, the risk of him not reaching an acceptable price within the remaining rounds is too high. It's more profitable to cut negotiations short and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
