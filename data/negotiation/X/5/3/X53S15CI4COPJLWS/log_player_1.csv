Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves some profit even if Bob makes a lower counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and encouraging message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Stating that the product is ""worth a lot to me"" emphasizes its potential value to Bob, even if he doesn't know the specifics. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! I've earned $5,000 above my minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer, considering how much I'm willing to lower the price to secure a deal. I'll also consider how much time I want to spend negotiating with Bob versus selling to John immediately for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I believe I can likely get more.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to pay at least $10,000. This indicates there's still room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I want to see if I can convince Bob to pay a little more. A counteroffer will allow me to test the waters and potentially secure a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll need to craft a counteroffer that is higher than $10,000 but still within a range that I'm comfortable with. I'll also consider how much I want to push for a higher price versus the risk of losing the deal to Bob altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! I understand that $10,000 is your initial offer, but I need to consider a slightly higher price to make this work for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By proposing $12,500, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while also aiming for a price that's closer to my initial offer.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product by stating that the price reflects it, making the offer more appealing.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and cooperative tone helps keep the negotiation amicable and encourages Bob to consider my offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  A good outcome, as I've secured a price that's closer to my ideal.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll need to decide if I want to continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John for $10,000. If I continue, I'll need to assess how much further I'm willing to lower the price and what my next counteroffer will be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. Is there any flexibility on your end? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We seem to be at an impasse, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price that's acceptable to me.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting valuable time, especially since John is willing to pay my minimum price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Sell to John:**  Selling to John immediately guarantees me my minimum profit of $10,000. While it's not ideal to get my full asking price, it's the most sensible choice given the current situation."
