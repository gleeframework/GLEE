"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! I understand that $10000 is your initial offer, but I need to consider a slightly higher price to make this work for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. Is there any flexibility on your end?",9000.0,Bob,4,
