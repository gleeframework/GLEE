Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a significant profit margin for me while still offering Bob a price that's $300,000 less than its value to him.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning the offer's exclusivity and impending availability to others (John), I aim to encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the deal."
