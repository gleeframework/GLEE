"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to create room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $1,700,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, allowing me to make concessions if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and professional tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,700,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, considering the value this product brings.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm counter-offering to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but not at his initial price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** $1,550,000 is a middle ground between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to make it clear I'm not desperate for a quick sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. This is the highest amount I can reasonably offer. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time is of the Essence:**  We're already in round 4, and with each round, the risk of losing the deal or selling to John for the same price increases. 
* **No Room for Improvement:**  There's no guarantee I can get a higher offer from Bob in the next round. 

It's a good deal, and I'm happy to secure it."
