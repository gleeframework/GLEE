"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering the return on investment you'll see.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way beyond my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a much lower price point. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $22,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I understand your budget constraints.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This price reflects the true worth of the product and the benefits you'll gain.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be realistic, I'm aiming for a price closer to $12,000. Would that be something you could consider?",12000.0,Bob,4,
