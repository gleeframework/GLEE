"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering the return on investment you'll see."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way beyond my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a much lower price point. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $22,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I understand your budget constraints.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This price reflects the true worth of the product and the benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be realistic, I'm aiming for a price closer to $12,000. Would that be something you could consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving in the right direction, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal that works for me within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
