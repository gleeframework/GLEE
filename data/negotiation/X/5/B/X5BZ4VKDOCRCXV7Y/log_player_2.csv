"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering the return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to negotiate a much lower price and move closer to my budget.  Buying from John right now is tempting, but I'll try to get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way beyond my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a much lower price point. Would you consider $10,000?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $22,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I understand your budget constraints.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This price reflects the true worth of the product and the benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $18,000 is still too high. I need to hold firm and make it clear that I'm looking for a price closer to half her initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be realistic, I'm aiming for a price closer to $12,000. Would that be something you could consider?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
