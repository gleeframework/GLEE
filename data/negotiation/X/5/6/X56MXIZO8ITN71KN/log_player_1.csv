Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also likely to be enticing to Bob given the product's value to him.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm confident that I can negotiate further with Bob and push him closer to my target price.  Selling to John is a fallback option, but I'm not ready to accept that price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves me some room to profit.  I'm hopeful Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept."
