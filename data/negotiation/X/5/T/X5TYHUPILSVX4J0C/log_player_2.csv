"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely starting high. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, potentially pushing her to lower the price closer to her own valuation."
