"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is significant to both of us. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1750000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1600000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can secure a higher price by rejecting his counteroffer and making my own in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our continued discussion, $1,600,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations for this unique product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I believe a fair price is $1,650,000.  Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my financial situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1625000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now within a reasonable range of my minimum desired price.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher amount, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower offer or delaying the sale isn't worth it at this point.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable transaction."
