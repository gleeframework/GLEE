Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer gives Bob a good deal, as it's still lower than the product's value to him. However, it also allows me to make a significant profit, exceeding my minimum desired price of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than the profit I'd like to make. I'm going to try to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept, as it's still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only slightly lower than my initial offer, and it's still higher than what I would get from John. It's worth accepting to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection."
