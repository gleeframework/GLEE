# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high. I'm willing to negotiate and see if we can reach a better price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is my final concession, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high.  While I recognize she's willing to negotiate, I'm not ready to accept a price that's so close to my ""buy from John"" threshold. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet halfway, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $825,000. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $825,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $875,000, which is $25,000 below my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within my budget and represents a significant reduction from her previous offer. It's worth accepting, as it's a good price and I don't want to risk the negotiation falling apart or having to buy from John at a much higher price."
