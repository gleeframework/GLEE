"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. It's a great price, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity to negotiate a better price or ultimately buy it from John for less than what Alice is offering."
