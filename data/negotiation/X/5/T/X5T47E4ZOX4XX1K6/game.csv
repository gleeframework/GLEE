"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I believe a price of $13,000 is fair.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet halfway at $11,000? It's a win-win, offering substantial value for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $11,000. How about we meet at $10,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
