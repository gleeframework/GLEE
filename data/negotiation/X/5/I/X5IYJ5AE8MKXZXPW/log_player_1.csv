"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:** 

Starting high allows room for negotiation. While $15,000 is above Bob's perceived value, it's important to gauge his initial reaction and leave space for a compromise that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is quite limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer matches John's price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. There's room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your budget constraints, the value of this product is truly significant. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counter-offer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price above both Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  Reiterating the product's value subtly reminds Bob of the benefits he would gain, potentially justifying the higher price. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Asking ""Would you consider..."" keeps the negotiation open and encourages Bob to respond positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still working within a tight budget. Could we possibly meet at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has remained firm at $12,000, matching John's offer. While we hoped for a higher price, continuing to push for more might lead to Bob walking away. Accepting the $12,000 now secures the sale at a price equal to our alternative option."
