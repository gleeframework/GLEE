Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations slightly above your minimum price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Potential Profit:** Offering the product at $175 gives you a potential profit of $25 over your minimum acceptable price and what John is willing to pay.
* **Perceived Value:**  The message subtly implies the product's value to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, there's still a chance to negotiate down to $150 or close to it before resorting to selling to John."
