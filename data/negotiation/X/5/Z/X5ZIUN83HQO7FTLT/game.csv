"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",13000.0,Bob,4,
