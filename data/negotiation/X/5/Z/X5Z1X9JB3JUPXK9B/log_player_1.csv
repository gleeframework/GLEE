"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($80), but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaches a price that's attractive to Bob. I'm also trying to build rapport with a friendly message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'd like to counter with a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than my minimum, I can likely get closer to Bob's value of $150. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $100 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $105 as my counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$105 is a good price for me, considering my minimum is $80 and Bob's value is $150. It's getting closer to what I want, and it's a reasonable price for Bob. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal altogether."
