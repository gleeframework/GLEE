Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This means a deal is unlikely unless you can convince Bob of additional value.

**Strategies and Offer**

Since a deal within the current valuations is impossible, you have two main options:

1. **High Anchor, Potential Negotiation:** Start with a high price to anchor the negotiation. This might give you room to negotiate down if Bob shows some interest.

   ```json
   {""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any concerns."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
   ```

2. **Direct Sale to John:** Knowing Bob likely won't meet your minimum, you can go directly to John.

   **Why this might be better:**
   * **Guaranteed Price:** You get your desired price with no negotiation hassle.
   * **Saves Time:**  You avoid potentially lengthy discussions with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  Put yourself in Bob's shoes. Why would he pay more than his perceived value? 
* **Relationship:** Is a future relationship with Bob important? A very high offer might sour that.
* **Additional Value:**  Can you identify any aspects of the product that might increase its value to Bob beyond $1,200,000?

**Recommendation:**

Unless you have strong reasons to believe Bob might pay more, going directly to John is the most logical choice in this scenario."
