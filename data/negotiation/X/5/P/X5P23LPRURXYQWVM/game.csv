"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and market demand. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you consider coming down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. Let's make this work. How about we settle at $1,050,000? ",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is my final compromise. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet at this price. If not, I'll consider other offers.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
