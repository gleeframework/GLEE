"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure it will be very profitable for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. I have 8 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I can still sell to John for $1,500,000 if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for your business. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not where I want to be. I have 6 rounds left and can potentially get a better offer from Bob, or I can sell to John for $1,500,000 if this negotiation fails. It's too early to settle for this price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,300,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although time is running out, I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my ideal price with a few more rounds.  I also have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if necessary.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,250,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is my final offer before I move on to other options.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,220,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the last two rounds, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but they are still too far away from what I desire. I have already rejected several offers, and there's a high chance that Bob will continue to hold back. It's not worth risking the remaining rounds. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the most financially sound decision at this point, ensuring I reach my minimum goal."
