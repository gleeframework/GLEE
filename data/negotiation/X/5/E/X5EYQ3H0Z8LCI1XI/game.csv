"Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I really like the product, but I have a budget to stick to, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9000. I appreciate your honesty about your budget, but I'm afraid I need to prioritize my own financial goals. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $10500? I think that's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet your target price, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9500? I think that's a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, and I'm glad to hear you're still interested in the product. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. How about we try $11000? I think that's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet your target price, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer, but I need to be honest with you, I'm really close to walking away and buying the product from another seller. How about we meet at $9800? I think that's as low as I'm willing to go.",9800.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to make a final offer, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9800. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $10800?
