Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180, knowing that the product is worth $150 to Bob.  This gives me a bit of wiggle room for negotiation while still getting a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $160 is better than my minimum, I believe I can push for a higher price. I'll try to get closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $170.  It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be enough to entice him to buy without pushing him to walk away entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob is now offering $165, which is a good profit and only $5 less than my initial counteroffer.  It's not worth risking a further rejection and potentially selling to John for $150."
