"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great price for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $700,000? That's a significant amount and a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $700,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know your final decision.",850000.0,Alice,5,
