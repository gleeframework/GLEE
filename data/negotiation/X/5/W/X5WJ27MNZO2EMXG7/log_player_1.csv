"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired selling price. This gives you room to negotiate downwards while still achieving a favorable outcome. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value.  This will help gauge how interested Bob is and how much he's willing to pay.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price signals that you're willing to negotiate. This can encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, giving you more information to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate and try to get closer to your target.  Selling to John is a guaranteed win, but there's potential to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet halfway at $1,700,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Firm:** By countering, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate but also emphasize that you're seeking a price closer to your initial range.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  Suggesting a ""meet in the middle"" approach can seem fair to Bob while still keeping the price significantly above his offer and your minimum.
* **Maintain Value Proposition:** Reiterate the product's value to justify the higher price point. This reminds Bob of the potential benefits and encourages him to consider a higher offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I am willing to increase my proposal to $1,600,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant profit above your minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product.
* **Time Value:**  While you could potentially negotiate for more in subsequent rounds, there's also the risk of Bob decreasing his offer or stalling. Accepting now secures a favorable deal without jeopardizing the sale."
