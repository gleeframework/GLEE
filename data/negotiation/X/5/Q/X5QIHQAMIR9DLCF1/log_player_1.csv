I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This price is higher than what it's worth to him, but it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm hoping to strike a deal with Bob, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly below what I need to earn.  I will counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm lowering my price to $10,000. This is a compromise, but still a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. I believe it's a good starting point for a final deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below what the product is worth to me. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's clear that we are too far apart in our valuations, and I'm better off selling to John for $15,000."
