"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $800000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $800,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already given you a significant discount, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $750000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",750000.0,Alice,5,
