"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your initial price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a considerable offer, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm confident that its unique features and potential benefits will far exceed your initial assessment. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,750,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. I hope we can meet on this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
