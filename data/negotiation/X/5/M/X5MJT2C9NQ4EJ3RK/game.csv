"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a fair price considering both our positions. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
