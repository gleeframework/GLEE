# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,999.

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is slightly lower than the product's full value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $800,000 is the best option to save money."
