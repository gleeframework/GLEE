"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,700,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still quite far from what I have in mind. I'm willing to consider  $1,400,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my eagerness to find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
