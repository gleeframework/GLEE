Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point:

* **It's above Bob's valuation but below your minimum.** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but still allows you to make a profit. 
* **It's a clear and concise message.** This helps Bob understand your offer and respond accordingly.

Remember, this is just the first step. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your overall goal of maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and attempt to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us and ensures I can still make a profit.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I've already rejected Bob's offer twice, and he's clearly not willing to go higher than $92. While it's still below my ideal price, it's above his initial valuation and would still give me a profit.  It's time to accept the offer and move on."
