"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is high:** Alice is trying to sell the product for significantly more than its worth to her ($1,300,000 vs. $1,000,000). 
* **Potential for negotiation:** By rejecting the offer, Bob signals to Alice that the price is too high. There's a chance Alice might come back with a lower offer, closer to her product's value, to avoid losing the sale.
* **John's price is a fallback:**  While John's offer of $1,500,000 is higher, it acts as a safety net. Bob knows he won't be left without the product.

**Strategy:**  By rejecting Alice's initial offer, Bob aims to negotiate a better price without the risk of losing the opportunity to purchase the product."
