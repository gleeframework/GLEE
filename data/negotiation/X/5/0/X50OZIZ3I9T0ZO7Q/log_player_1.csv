Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $100. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While getting closer to my goal of $100, $92 is still a bit too low. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's try $94.  I think that's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 94}
```"

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it's clear that we're not going to reach a price that works for both of us.  John is offering a fair price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
