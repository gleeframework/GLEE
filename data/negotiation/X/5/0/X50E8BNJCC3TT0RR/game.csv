"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is likely much higher.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to be sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to part with the product for $700,000. Considering its value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the value I place on it.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $750,000, which is a fair price considering both of our positions. Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $850,000, which is still a significant discount from the product's true value to you. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about $800,000? This is a good compromise and allows us both to get a fair deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to give away the product at a price that's below its true value to me. I'll meet you at $825,000, which is still a discount from the product's true value to you. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,7,
