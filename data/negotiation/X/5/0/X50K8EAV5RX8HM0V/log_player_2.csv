"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. I've priced it competitively at $950000, recognizing the significant value it holds for you. This price represents a substantial return on investment for you, while still allowing me to secure a fair price for the product. Let me know if you're interested, as I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but still not the best deal.**  You can get the product for $50,000 less from Alice than from John. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so you have leverage to push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer signals that you're willing to walk away, which might encourage Alice to make a counteroffer."
