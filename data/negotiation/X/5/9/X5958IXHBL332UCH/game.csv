"Bob, I understand you have a limited budget, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $1350000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not sure I can go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a decent profit. How about we meet at $1320000? That's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to work with you.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
