"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You can definitely do better than $9,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $8,500?  This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $8,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to sell it for, but I think it's still a great deal for both of you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $8,750 is a good deal for Bob.  It's lower than Bob's initial maximum price of $10,000 and leaves some room for Alice to make a profit.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price. It's wise to accept this offer."
