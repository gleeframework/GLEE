Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you.  I'm asking for $1,100,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob first. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a strong offer. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but the message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential,"" hoping to influence his perception and still leaves me with a significant profit.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a time constraint aims to encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without excessive negotiation.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, by starting with a strong offer and a persuasive message, I increase my chances of securing a higher sale price before resorting to my backup buyer."
