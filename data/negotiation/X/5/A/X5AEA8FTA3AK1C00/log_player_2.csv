Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1200000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  How about $1350000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're making progress. I understand your position, but $1275000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1300000.
