"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500. What are your thoughts?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,500. How about we settle on $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",11250.0,Alice,5,
