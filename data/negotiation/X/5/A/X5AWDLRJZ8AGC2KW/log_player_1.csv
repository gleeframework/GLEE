"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. $12,500 is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $14,000?  This is still a great deal for you considering its value to you. Let's try to reach a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12500, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is my minimum, I think there's still room for negotiation.  I'm willing to risk losing a few rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're set on $12,500, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price.  Would you be willing to go up just a little to $13,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product. "", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob seems to be firm on his price, and I've already made several concessions.  With only a few rounds left, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price. John is offering a guaranteed $12,000, which is my minimum."
