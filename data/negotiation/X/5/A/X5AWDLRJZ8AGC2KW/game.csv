"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $12000 to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $12500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $14000?  This is still a great deal for you considering its value to you. Let's try to reach a mutually beneficial price.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're set on $12500, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price.  Would you be willing to go up just a little to $13000?  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product. ",13000.0,Alice,5,
