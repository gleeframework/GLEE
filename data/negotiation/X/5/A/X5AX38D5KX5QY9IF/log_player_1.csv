"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing $22,000. I'm confident it can greatly benefit you."", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a strong initial offer allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. This strategy tests Bob's willingness to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and your initial asking price. Accepting would be a substantial loss. It's worth negotiating further, as there's a chance to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $19,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a significant step down from $22,000 to $19,000. This shows Bob we're willing to negotiate and creates a sense of momentum.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $19,000 keeps us well above our $15,000 minimum and leaves room for further adjustments if needed. 
* **Justification:**  We're reinforcing the product's value to justify the higher price, aiming to anchor Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I see the value in the product, $19,000 is still outside my budget. Would you consider $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is incrementally increasing his offer,  $9,500 is still significantly below our $15,000 minimum. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can bring him closer to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $9,500 is still a significant gap from where I see this product's value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000, which I believe is a fair offer reflecting the benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're decreasing our offer by $2,000 this time, signaling that we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Focus on Value:** We're reiterating the product's benefits to justify the price, emphasizing Bob's return on investment.
* **Maintaining Firmness:**  While willing to negotiate, we're holding firm above our $15,000 minimum, demonstrating the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I need to stick to my budget.  I could go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has clearly stated his absolute limit is $10,000.  This is significantly below our $15,000 minimum and continuing to negotiate is unlikely to bridge the gap. Accepting John's offer ensures we get our minimum acceptable price without further risk of prolonged negotiation."
