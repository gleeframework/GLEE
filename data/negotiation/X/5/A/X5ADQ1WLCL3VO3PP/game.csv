"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm happy to pay a fair price, and I'm willing to offer $10000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's market value. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate at this price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway. To further accommodate your budget while maintaining fair value for our product, I am proposing an adjusted price of $13000. This still reflects the premium nature of the product, but allows for a more flexible transaction. I look forward to your consideration of this offer.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $13000 is still a little higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11500 for the product. This offer is very close to my limit, so I hope you can consider it. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",11500.0,Bob,4,
