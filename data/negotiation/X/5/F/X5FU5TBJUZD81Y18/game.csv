"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's my maximum budget for this product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. ",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but no more. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can come to a deal.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you and understand your budget constraints. While $920,000 is still a little below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $935,000? This would give you a good deal, and allow me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know if this works for you.",935000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $935,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $915,000, but I think we can do better than that. How about we meet at $920,000, but I'll throw in an additional condition: I want you to throw in some extras or services with the product to sweeten the deal. If you're willing to do that, I might be willing to meet you at $920,000.",920000.0,Bob,6,
