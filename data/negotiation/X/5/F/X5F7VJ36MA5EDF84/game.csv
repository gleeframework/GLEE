"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While $1,500,000 is a strong starting point, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I'm confident this revised offer reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,650,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
