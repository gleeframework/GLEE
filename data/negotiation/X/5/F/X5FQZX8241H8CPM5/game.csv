"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe this product has potential,  your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm on a tight budget and $10,500 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. How about $9,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
