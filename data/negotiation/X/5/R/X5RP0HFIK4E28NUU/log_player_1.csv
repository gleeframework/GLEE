Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  The ideal scenario is to sell to Bob for a price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**The Offer**

You need to balance ambition with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. Here's an option:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  This is a unique chance to acquire it before I explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the product's value to Bob.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,350,000 leaves room for you to potentially negotiate down slightly while still remaining well above your minimum.
* **Gentle Pressure:** Mentioning ""other options"" subtly implies you have alternatives if Bob declines.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. If he's more agreeable, this offer might be spot-on.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, you might offer a lower price to ensure a deal.

**Remember, this is just one possible offer. Adjust your strategy and price based on any additional information you have about Bob and your negotiation style.**"
