"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to offer it to you at a price of $900,000. I believe this is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with the deal.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $837,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to your business.",837500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I could make this work for $800,000.  It's a strong offer, and I'm ready to finalize the deal today if you're agreeable.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",825000.0,Alice,7,
