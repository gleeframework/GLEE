# Alice's message: I think we're really close now, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession to get the deal done. I can offer it to you for $775,000, but I need you to meet me at that price. It's the lowest I can go.

It's clear Alice is very unlikely to go below $775,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $800,000, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed lower price from John rather than risk Alice not budging and ending up paying more."
