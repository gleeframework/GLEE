Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a fair price is $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product's value to Bob is $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed buyer at that price, you start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves room for negotiation.  Bob might try to haggle the price down, and you can potentially still secure a deal significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Confident tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob before resorting to your guaranteed sale with John."
