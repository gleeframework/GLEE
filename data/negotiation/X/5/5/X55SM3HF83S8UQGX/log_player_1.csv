Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering its potential for you.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, our goal is to maximize profit. Therefore, we should aim higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than our guaranteed sale price.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product for $1,350,000 gives Bob a substantial discount while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value and potential"" to subtly justify the higher price to Bob."
