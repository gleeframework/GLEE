Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $110. I believe it offers significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed sale for $80 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $110, you aim to capture a significant portion of the value Bob sees in the product while leaving him with a $10 gain. This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
