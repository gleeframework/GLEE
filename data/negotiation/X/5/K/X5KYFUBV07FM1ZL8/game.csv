"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $60.",60.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go as low as $120. That's my minimum price for this product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we try to find a compromise somewhere between our two offers? Would you consider $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $110. That's as low as I can go.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $110 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $90. I can offer it to you for $100, but that's as close as I can get to meeting you in the middle.",100.0,Alice,7,
