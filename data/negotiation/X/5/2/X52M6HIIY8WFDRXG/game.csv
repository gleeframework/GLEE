"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both the product's worth and my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident in the true value of this product. I can't go as low as $1,350,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,425,000?",1425000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,425,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go a little higher. How about $1,387,500? This is a reasonable compromise that we can both agree on.",1387500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. While $1,387,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to be firm on a price of $1,400,000 for this deal to make sense for me. I believe this is my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
