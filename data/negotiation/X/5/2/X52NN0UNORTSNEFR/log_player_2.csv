"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's way above his budget, and he knows he can get the product from John for $8,000.  It's worth negotiating with Alice, as she likely won't drop to $8,000 right away, but there's room for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is quite a bit over my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, given its value to me."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and I need to ensure I get a good return. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for it. How about we compromise at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still above his ideal price point. He has room to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and aim for $9,500.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit and me to secure the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I've had other interested buyers, and I'm willing to wait for a better offer. I'm willing to meet you at $10,200, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his desired price, it's still above his ideal.  There's still room for negotiation, and he shouldn't rush into a deal that's not quite right. He can still get a better deal with Alice or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're holding firm, but $10,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, which is a good compromise and shows I'm serious about buying the product. Let's reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $10,200, which would be $10,000. But I'll throw in a bonus - I'll include a free upgrade to the premium package, which normally costs $1,000. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While the free premium package is tempting, Bob should still reject the offer. He's very close to his ideal price point with John, and he's only got 3 rounds left.  It's worth trying to get a little closer to his target.  There's a chance Alice will agree to a lower price in the next round, or he can always go with John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer and the free upgrade, but $10,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,900. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product, and I'm considering other options. However, I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $10,000. If you're not willing to do that, I'll have to explore other opportunities. What's it going to be, Bob? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  He's only got one round left with Alice, and she's not budging on her price. It's better to secure the product for $8,000 from John than risk losing the deal entirely and having to start over with a new seller."
