"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is quite a bit over my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, given its value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and I need to ensure I get a good return. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for it. How about we compromise at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and aim for $9,500.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit and me to secure the product within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I've had other interested buyers, and I'm willing to wait for a better offer. I'm willing to meet you at $10,200, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're holding firm, but $10,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, which is a good compromise and shows I'm serious about buying the product. Let's reach an agreement on this price.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $10,200, which would be $10,000. But I'll throw in a bonus - I'll include a free upgrade to the premium package, which normally costs $1,000. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal for you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer and the free upgrade, but $10,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,900. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal. Let's make this happen!",9900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product, and I'm considering other options. However, I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $10,000. If you're not willing to do that, I'll have to explore other opportunities. What's it going to be, Bob?",10000.0,Alice,9,
