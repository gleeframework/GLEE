Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'll offer you a revised price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my original asking price.

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000 and it's no longer worth the risk of further negotiation. John's offer is a sure thing at this point."
