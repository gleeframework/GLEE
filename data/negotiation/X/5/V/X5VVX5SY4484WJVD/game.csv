"Alice, while I appreciate your confidence in the product, $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which reflects its value to me. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the significant value it will bring to your business in the long run.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,600,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
