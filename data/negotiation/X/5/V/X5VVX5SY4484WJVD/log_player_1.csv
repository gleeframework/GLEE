"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in this product. I'm confident it can be a valuable asset to you. I'm offering it at $2,250,000. This is a fair starting point considering its potential."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a high anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price well above your acceptable minimum.
* **Justification:** Vaguely mentioning ""potential"" without concrete details can sometimes encourage a buyer to focus on the perceived upside rather than a fixed value proposition.
* **Future Rounds:**  This initial offer leaves plenty of room for negotiation over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your confidence in the product, $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which reflects its value to me. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While it's closer to your target, you have ample rounds left to negotiate a better deal. Selling to John right now would be leaving money on the table. It's time to counter and see how much Bob is willing to move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the significant value it will bring to your business in the long run."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Concession:**  You've made a substantial concession from $2,250,000 to $2,000,000, showing willingness to negotiate. However, you're still well above both Bob's offer and your minimum. 
* **Value Focus:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly nudging Bob to reconsider his valuation.
* **Anchoring:** This counteroffer keeps a strong anchor above $1,500,000, leaving room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,600,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk that Bob might walk away in subsequent rounds. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of ending up with a worse deal or having to sell to John at your minimum."
