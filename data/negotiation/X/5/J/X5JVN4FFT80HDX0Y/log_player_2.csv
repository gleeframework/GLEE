# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1100000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  I'm confident you'll find this to be a great investment.  Let me know your decision and we can move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and buying from John for $800,000 is cheaper than Alice's offer of $1,100,000."
