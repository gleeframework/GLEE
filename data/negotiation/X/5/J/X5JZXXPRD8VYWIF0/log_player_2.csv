It's always worth trying to get a better price.  You can counteroffer Alice and see if she'll budge."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to offer the product to you for $10800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

Alice has come down in price, which is good. However, you're still $800 above your target price. It's worth seeing if you can get her closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, $10600 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $10700.  This is a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700

At this point, you're very close to your target price of $10,000.  While $10,700 is not a bad deal, it's still more than you're willing to pay.  It's better to go with John's offer and save yourself the $700."
