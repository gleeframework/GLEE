{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so $11,000 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:**  This ensures you're still getting a decent profit if Bob accepts. 
* **It allows for negotiation:**  The message encourages Bob to make a counteroffer if he's not happy with the price. 

Remember, this is just the first offer. You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to buy the product for $10500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than Bob's initial value of $10,000, it's still below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, but still lower than John's offer.  I want to find a middle ground that keeps Bob interested while also ensuring I get a fair price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to offer the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards my target:**  This counteroffer is closer to my minimum desired price of $12,000.  
* **Still below John's offer:**  It's important to keep in mind that I can sell to John for $12,000 at any time.
* **Finding middle ground:**  $10,800 is a compromise between Bob's offer of $10,500 and my previous offer of $11,000.
* **Encouraging negotiation:**  The message reiterates my willingness to work with Bob and allows for further discussion. 

This counteroffer should keep Bob engaged in the negotiation while also moving us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference - how about $10600?  That's still a good deal for you, and it fits my budget.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,600 is closer to my desired price, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I am not willing to sell the product for less than $12,000, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who is willing to pay that price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum. I will still try to negotiate with Bob to get a price closer to $12,000, but I am prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, $10,600 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $10,700.  This is a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm:** This offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, I'm showing that I'm willing to meet him in the middle.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still prepared to sell to John if Bob continues to reject my offers. 

This counteroffer should keep the negotiation moving while also putting pressure on Bob to come closer to my desired price."
