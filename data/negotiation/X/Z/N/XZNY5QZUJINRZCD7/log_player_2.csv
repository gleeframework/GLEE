"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $130. I believe it's a very fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $150.**  
* **You have room to negotiate.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $130 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to do $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $115. Could we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your target price range of $150.** 
* **It's a good compromise.**  While you would prefer a lower price, accepting $125 saves you $25 compared to buying from John.  
* **Continuing to negotiate might not be worth it.** There's a chance Alice could become less flexible, and you could end up paying more than $125 or even having to buy from John at $150."
