"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can make this work!",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's my absolute top limit, and it's a fair price considering your asking price. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
