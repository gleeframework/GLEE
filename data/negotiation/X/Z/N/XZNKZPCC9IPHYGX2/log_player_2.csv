"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $12,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's desired price point.  While it's closer to Bob's budget, it's still $500 more than Bob is willing to spend.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's my absolute top limit, and it's a fair price considering your asking price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
