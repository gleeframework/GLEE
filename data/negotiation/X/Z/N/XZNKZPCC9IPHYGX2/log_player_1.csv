"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, but also shows that I value the product highly.  I'm hoping to entice Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing us to start a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value for the product ($10,000). I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value.  I'll need to be strategic to ensure I don't lose Bob completely, but I'm confident we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my desired price and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and hopefully motivates Bob to make another counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's my absolute top limit, and it's a fair price considering your asking price. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly what I value the product at. I've already had a couple of rounds of negotiations and it's clear that we're both at our limits. It's better to close the deal now rather than risk further rounds that might lead to a stalemate or worse, losing the deal entirely."
