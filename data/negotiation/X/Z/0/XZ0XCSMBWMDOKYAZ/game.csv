"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a way to make this work!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer.  Let me know your decision.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're firm on your price, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more offer: $1,260,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to reconsider and buy from John for $1,200,000.",1260000.0,Bob,6,
