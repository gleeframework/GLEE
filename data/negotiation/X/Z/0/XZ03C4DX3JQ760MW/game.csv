,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $10500? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference again - $10000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $9000 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we compromise at $9750? It's a small step closer for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",9750.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to come to an agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $9500 as a final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to lose this opportunity to work with you.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,9,
