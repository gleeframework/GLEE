Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500.  I believe it would be of great value to you, and this is a competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from the sale.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $10,000 allows Alice to aim for a price closer to that figure. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $9,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a great price for Alice.
* **Backup Option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still sell to John for $8,000, ensuring she doesn't lose out entirely."
