Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, given its potential value to me.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering your own valuation.  Let's discuss. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,800,000. This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not able to meet your price of $1,800,000.  However, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part and reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but we're still significantly below our minimum. We'll continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is closer to a fair price, it's still a significant gap from my valuation.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and offers a mutually beneficial outcome."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also allowing me to make a profit.  Let's find a way to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

Bob seems firm at $1,200,000 and unlikely to move significantly higher.  Rather than risk further time and potentially a lower offer, it's best to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
