Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is closer to a fair price, it's still a significant gap from my valuation.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and offers a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.
