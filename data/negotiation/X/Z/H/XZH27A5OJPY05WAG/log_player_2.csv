**Reasoning:**

Alice is consistently staying above our target price and seems unwilling to go much lower.  While we could continue negotiating, we risk:

* **Alice refusing to budge further:** We could end up in a stalemate.
* **Wasting time:** Each round takes time, and we already have a guaranteed option at $100.

It's strategically better to secure the product from John at $100. This avoids further negotiation and guarantees we obtain the product."
