Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with my target price of $100.  This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as I have another buyer (John) who will pay that amount.  By starting high, I leave room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my price point while still leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $82.5. While it's still lower than my initial target, it's higher than what I initially considered my minimum and is a good compromise. It's worth noting that I could risk further negotiation with Bob, but I'm concerned he may drop out, and I'd be left with John's $100 offer. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a sale and avoid the risk of getting stuck with a lower price."
