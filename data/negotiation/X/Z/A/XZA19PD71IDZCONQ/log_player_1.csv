"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 200
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate and might even lead to exceeding your expectations. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This first offer allows us to see how interested Bob is. If he outright rejects this high price, we know we'll need to adjust significantly. If he counteroffers, we get a better idea of his price range. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing that John will buy the product for $150 gives us a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't go well, we can walk away and still get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum. We have room to negotiate and should try to meet somewhere in the middle. Selling to John for $150 is tempting, but we might be able to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Bob, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160?"", 
""product_price"": 160
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer aims to find a compromise. We've come down from our initial price, signaling flexibility, while still staying above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Testing the Waters:** Offering $160 allows us to see if Bob is willing to budge significantly from his initial offer. It will give us a better understanding of his potential price ceiling.
* **Time Constraint:**  We only have 10 rounds, so it's crucial to make progress in each round and move towards a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** While not ideal, $140 is still a profit above our minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a willingness to make a deal. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but there's also a risk that Bob could walk away. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable profit."
