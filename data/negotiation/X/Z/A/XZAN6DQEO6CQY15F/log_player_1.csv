Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe holds significant value for someone with your insights. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,250,000."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, starting at $1,250,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a profit closer to the higher end.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value by mentioning ""significant value"" and ""potential,""  encouraging Bob to consider its worth beyond his initial assessment.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing""  signals to Bob that there's flexibility in the price, making him more likely to engage in negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the process."
