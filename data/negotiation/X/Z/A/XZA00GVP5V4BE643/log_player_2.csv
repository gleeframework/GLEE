"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120, you know you can get the product for $120 from John if you reject Alice's offer.  There's a chance Alice will come down in price, allowing you to save more."
