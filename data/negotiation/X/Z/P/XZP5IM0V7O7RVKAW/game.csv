"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $110 is closer, I'm still only able to go as high as $105.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $115. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
