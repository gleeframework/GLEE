Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential for your business.  I could consider coming down to $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain.
