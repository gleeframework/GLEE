"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? I'm confident this product would be a great addition to my collection.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $10,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? I'm really serious about buying this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product for $11,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
