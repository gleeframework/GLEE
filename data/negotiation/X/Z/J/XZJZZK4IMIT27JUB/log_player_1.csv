Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but we also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.  
* **Highlight value:**  While not essential, mentioning ""fair price"" can subtly nudge Bob towards seeing the offer favorably.

**Important:** We don't want to price too low because we have John as a backup buyer. This strategy aims to get a good deal from Bob without risking losing the sale entirely."
