Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. This is a great deal considering its value, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly below my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $50 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $50 is significantly lower than the value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a firm budget in mind.  Could we meet in the middle at $65? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm determined to get closer to my minimum price. I'll reject his offer and try again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $65 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $75?  That's a solid offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

```

While $75 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a higher offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and try for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $75 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. Let's try $85.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
