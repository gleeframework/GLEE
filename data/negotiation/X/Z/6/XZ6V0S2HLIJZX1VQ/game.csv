"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $50 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $50 is significantly lower than the value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from the product. Let's make this deal happen!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a firm budget in mind.  Could we meet in the middle at $65? I think that's a fair offer.",65.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $65 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen!",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $75?  That's a solid offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $75 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. Let's try $85.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?",85.0,Alice,7,
