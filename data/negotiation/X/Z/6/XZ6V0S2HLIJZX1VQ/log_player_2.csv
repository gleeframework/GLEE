"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. This is a great deal considering its value, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $50 for the product.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 50
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:** We're starting with a very low counteroffer to signal Alice that we're serious about getting a good deal. This gives us more room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite & Direct:** The message remains polite to maintain a good negotiating environment.
* **Alternative in Mind:** We always keep in mind John's offer of $80. We'll need to move closer to that price if Alice completely rejects our initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $50 is significantly lower than the value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from the product. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit, but $100 is still far from both our initial offer and our maximum budget. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a firm budget in mind.  Could we meet in the middle at $65? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise & Firmness:** We're moving closer to a compromise while signaling that we're serious about our budget.  The phrase ""firm budget"" emphasizes our limits.
* **Middle Ground:** $65 is a significant increase from our previous offer and lands closer to a potential agreement point between our initial offer and Alice's counter.
* **Time Constraint:** We're aware that time is passing, and we want to guide the negotiation towards a close before we run out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $65 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but we're still not at our ideal budget.  We're only $10 away from John's offer, so we need to push a bit further and see if Alice will come down more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $75?  That's a solid offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Nearing the End:** We're getting close to the end of our negotiation window, and we need to push for a final decision. 
* **Strong Offer:** $75 is a strong offer, splitting the difference between our last offer and Alice's counteroffer. 
* **Urgency & Willingness:** We're conveying a sense of urgency to close the deal while demonstrating we're willing to meet Alice halfway for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $75 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. Let's try $85.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, signaling she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Acceptable Price:** $85 is within our $80 budget, exceeding it by a small margin.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're running out of rounds, and further negotiation might lead to us losing the opportunity for a deal with Alice.

While we could try to push for $80, it's risky.  Accepting at $85 secures the product at a price close to our goal."
