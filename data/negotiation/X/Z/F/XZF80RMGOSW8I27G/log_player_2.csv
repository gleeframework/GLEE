"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $80 to me, so I'd be paying $10 more than its value to me. I'd rather buy it from John for $80.
