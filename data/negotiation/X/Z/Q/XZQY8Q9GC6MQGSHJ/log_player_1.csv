Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too high that it immediately shuts down the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $1,250,000 is a reasonable starting point. It leaves room for Bob to counter and for us to come to an agreement. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000 gives me confidence to push for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest and is willing to negotiate.  There's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Leveraging John:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me the leverage to push for a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while keeping things within your budget.  Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($1,250,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This demonstrates flexibility and shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, suggesting that $1,050,000 is still a good investment for him.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not giving in to Bob's initial low offer, but I'm also not being unreasonable. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining my bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Limited Upside:**  While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, the gap between our offers is still substantial.  There's a risk of getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation with diminishing returns.
* **Leveraging John:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum.  I'm not willing to lose out on a much higher price for a small increase from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

Since Bob is showing some flexibility, I will counter with a slightly lower price, but still above my minimum.  I will aim for a price that is closer to my minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  While $950,000 is still a bit below what I need, I'm willing to make one more concession.  I'm proposing a final price of $1,000,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to move forward with the sale.  I'm confident it will be a wise investment for your business."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm aiming for a final price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves a little room for negotiation.  
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the potential return on investment for Bob. 
* **Setting a Deadline:** I'm indicating that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.

**Why not accept John's offer?**

While accepting John's offer would be the safest option, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I believe there's a chance Bob will accept my final offer, and I'm willing to take that risk."
