"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product's worth to me.  This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially make more money.  I'm also aware of the 10-round limit and John's offer, so I'll need to be strategic in my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a better offer than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I believe it's a reasonable price that still allows me to profit.  We're getting closer to a deal and with only 7 rounds left, I need to start finding a balance between being firm and being willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to $12,000 with a counteroffer.  I'm aware that John is a safe option at $12,000, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12250}
```

I'm offering $12,250. This is a further compromise, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a profit.  I'm getting close to John's offer, so I need to be mindful of the time remaining and potentially switch to John if the deal falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum price. I could sell to John for the same amount, but with only four rounds left, I'm taking this deal. I don't want to risk not reaching an agreement with Bob and then having to accept John's offer."
