"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell the product to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $850,000 to you. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you and the value I'm willing to part with.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I'm placing on this product.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your commitment to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll sell the product to you for $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the value of the product.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $875,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $860,000, and I truly believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you think?",860000.0,Bob,6,
