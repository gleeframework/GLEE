Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $130. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing he values the product at $150.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While aiming high, starting too close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) might make him feel like he's being taken advantage of and could lead to an immediate rejection."
