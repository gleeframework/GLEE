"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. My starting price is $130. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is above my maximum budget. It makes sense to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than my maximum budget but still leaving room for negotiation. This gives Alice the opportunity to counter and allows us to hopefully meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $115? That's still a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $115 is still above my target price. I'll reject and counter to see if I can get closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $100 was a bit low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $107?"",
""product_price"": 107
}
``` 

I'm inching closer to her price, signaling that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $107 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $110, which is a reasonable compromise and a good deal compared to John's price of $120. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, so it's best to accept and close the deal now."
