"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm going to start with a price that gives me a good margin and see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good price, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5

I'm sticking to my strategy of meeting Bob halfway, offering $960,000. I'm hoping that showing a willingness to compromise will get us closer to a deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not ready to accept Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to get closer to $950,000 before I have to consider selling to John.  I'll counteroffer one more time and see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 945000}

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations are getting too close to my minimum, and I risk losing too much value.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Selling to John guarantees a reasonable profit."
