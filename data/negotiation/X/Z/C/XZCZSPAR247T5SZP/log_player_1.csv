Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $150. If he rejects, I can then lower the price slightly, or if he makes a counteroffer, I can evaluate whether it's worth accepting or making a counteroffer of my own.  Remember, I also have the option of selling to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I want to see if I can get him to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I value your business, $130 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'll try to stay within my budget while still getting a good deal. Could you consider $130 as the final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has been insistent on $130, and while that's not a terrible price, I'm not willing to go any lower.  I've already been flexible, and I'm confident John will buy it for my desired price of $150.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a more lucrative deal."
