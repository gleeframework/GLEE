"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great opportunity.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your initial offer, it's a bit too low for me to consider at this point. I understand the product's value to you, and I'm willing to pay a price that reflects that.  How about $700,000? This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $725,000. This price takes into account the product's value to both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. How about $710,000? I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.  What do you think?",710000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can do better than that. How about $720,000? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",720000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on this price, but I'm still aiming for a slightly lower figure.  How about $715,000? This would allow me to move forward with the purchase, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",715000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think I can do no more. How about $725,000? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.
