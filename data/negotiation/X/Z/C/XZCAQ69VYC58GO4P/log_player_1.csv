I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This strategy is based on the idea that Bob may be willing to pay more than John, as I have no information about his valuation of the product.  If he rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $800,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant profit."
