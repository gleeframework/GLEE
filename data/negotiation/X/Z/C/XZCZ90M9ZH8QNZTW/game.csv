"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within $8,000. Would you be willing to accommodate this?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $9,500? This gives us both some room to compromise, and I believe this price reflects the product's true value.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand your position, I must stick to my budget of $8,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
