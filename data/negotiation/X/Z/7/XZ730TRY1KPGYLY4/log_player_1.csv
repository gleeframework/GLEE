Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is more than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's lower than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** There is room for both of you to compromise and reach a deal. 
* **Shows you're willing to negotiate:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, making Bob more likely to engage in the conversation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product worth it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I could keep negotiating, it's likely that we'll continue to go back and forth without reaching an agreement. It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $120."
