Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, giving us an opportunity to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer of $13,000 is still a good deal for me. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely that if I reject his offer and counter with a higher price, he may walk away and I'll have to sell to John for $12,000."
