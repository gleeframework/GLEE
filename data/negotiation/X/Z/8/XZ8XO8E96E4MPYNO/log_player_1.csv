Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm happy to offer it at a price of $12,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential benefits for you."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($8,000). 
* **Strong Starting Point:** $12,000 allows for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net if Bob rejects the offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making the offer more enticing.
* **Negotiation:** This offer opens the door for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a higher final price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Offering it at a very high price (close to $15,000) might scare Bob away, while a very low price leaves potential profit on the table."
