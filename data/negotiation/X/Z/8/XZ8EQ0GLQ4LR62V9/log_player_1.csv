Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $100. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin the negotiation with an offer slightly above my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a profitable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give me insight into his level of interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan (John):**  I'm aware that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100. This knowledge gives me leverage during the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $75 is below his own stated valuation of $80. This suggests he's willing to negotiate further and there's potential for a higher sale price.
* **My Minimum:** Accepting $75 would be a loss for me, as my minimum is $100.
* **Negotiating Power:** I still hold the advantage as I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 

**Next Step:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired outcome, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a significant discount from my initial asking price."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling willingness to negotiate by significantly lowering my price from the initial offer. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $90 represents a compromise that is closer to my desired price while still being above Bob's initial offer.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the discount, I'm emphasizing the value Bob would be getting. 
* **Observation:**  Bob's response to this counteroffer will be crucial in determining my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $82? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $82 is above his initial offer and only slightly below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away, leaving me to sell to John for $100.  Accepting $82 is a reasonable compromise for a quicker and almost equally profitable sale. 
* **Limited Upside:** It's unlikely Bob will go much higher than $82 given his previous statements about his budget."
