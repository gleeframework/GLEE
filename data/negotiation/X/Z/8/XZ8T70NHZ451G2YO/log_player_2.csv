"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* $999,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation, especially since you have 10 rounds and the alternative price is $1,200,000. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. 
* $900,000 is a substantial reduction, but still leaves room for negotiation in future rounds.
* I'm trying to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see how far she's willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer, but it's still more than I'm willing to pay at this point.
* There are still 7 rounds left, and I believe there's room for further negotiation to get closer to my target price.
* Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good price.
* $925,000 is a compromise between Alice's offer and my previous counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway. 
* This allows me to potentially get closer to a final agreement in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price.
* I've already rejected a few offers and made counteroffers, and the negotiation process is taking time.
* With only 5 rounds left, I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, I might end up having to pay more or even miss out on the deal altogether.
* Accepting this offer at $975,000 still saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John. 
* It's a reasonable compromise given the time constraints and the potential risk of losing the deal."
