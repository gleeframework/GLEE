I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but still leaves me with a profit. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $9,500.  This is a compromise that meets him halfway, but still gives me a profit closer to my desired amount."
