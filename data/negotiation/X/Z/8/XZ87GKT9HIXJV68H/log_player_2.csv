"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price of $12,000, Bob can still get a better deal.  He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering $9,000, which is still a good deal for Alice as it's higher than her minimum acceptable price of $8,000 (since the product is worth $12,000 to her).  This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a better price. It leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $9,500. This is closer to Bob's desired price of $8,000 but still a bit too high. At this point, Bob has the option to continue negotiating with Alice, but the risk is that Alice might keep increasing the price, leading to a worse deal than what he can get from John.  It's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John for $8,000 and get the product for his target price."
