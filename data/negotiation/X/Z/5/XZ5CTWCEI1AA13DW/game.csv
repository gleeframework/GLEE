"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer,  $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  I'm confident you'll find this product is worth the investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as high as $8,500. I'd be willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the price I've already found from another seller. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
