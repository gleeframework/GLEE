Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $15,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product but would only be able to pay $8,000 for it. This reflects the value I place on it. Let me know if you're open to discussing that price further.
