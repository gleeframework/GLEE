"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $15,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product but would only be able to pay $8,000 for it. This reflects the value I place on it. Let me know if you're open to discussing that price further.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit while also accommodating your budget. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking to my original offer of $8,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $8,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell it to you for $9,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
