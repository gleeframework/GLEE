"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's not a good deal for you. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $15,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product but would only be able to pay $8,000 for it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit while also accommodating your budget. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is closer to my budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum of $8,000. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking to my original offer of $8,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $8,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell it to you for $9,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  I'm not willing to go any higher. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John. While I'd like to get the product for even less, I know I can get a fair deal from John at $8,000."
