(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $12,000. Offering $13,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's halfway between Alice's desired price and Bob's maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has increased her offer slightly, it's still above Bob's preferred price point. Bob is determined to get the best deal possible and sees room for further negotiation.  Rejecting allows him to continue trying for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $12,000.  He increases his offer by $500, showing he's willing to compromise, but still trying to get a good deal. This counteroffer is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, making it more likely to be accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are minimal, and the risk of not reaching a deal increases. It's more efficient for Bob to buy from John for $15,000, ensuring he gets the product while minimizing the time spent negotiating."
