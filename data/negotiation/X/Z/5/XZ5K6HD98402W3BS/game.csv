"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to make a living too! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $135 for the product. Can we discuss this further?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from the price you're asking. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $100.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you halfway yet. I'm willing to lower my price to $140, but that's as low as I can go. Can we meet at $140?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to walking away, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $137.50. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. Can we meet at $137.50?",137.5,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about making a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $137.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer of $130. Would you be willing to consider a price of $132.50?",132.5,Bob,8,
