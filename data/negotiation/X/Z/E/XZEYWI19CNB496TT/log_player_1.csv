{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  Offering the product at $110 provides a potential $30 profit, which is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($80). 
* **""Special Offer"" Framing:**  By positioning it as a ""special price"" just for Bob, you add a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially influencing his decision.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Unknown Valuation:** While we know Bob values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay slightly more. This offer tests that possibility.
* **Negotiation Potential:** This first offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price a bit high. You can then decide whether to negotiate or stick with selling to John."
