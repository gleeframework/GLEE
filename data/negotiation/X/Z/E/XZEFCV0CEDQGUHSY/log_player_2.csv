Round 2

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product exceeds $40 significantly.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'm surprised that Alice rejected my counteroffer and is now offering the product for $80, which is the same price that John is willing to sell it to me for. I'd like to reject Alice's offer and stick with my original plan to buy the product from John for $80, as it's the same price and I don't want to overpay.
