"I appreciate the offer, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $40 for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price.",40.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product exceeds $40 significantly. To reach a fair agreement, I propose we set the price at $80. This still allows for some flexibility while ensuring a reasonable return for the product.",80.0,Alice,3,
