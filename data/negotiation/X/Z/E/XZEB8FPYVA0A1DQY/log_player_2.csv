"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I was thinking more like $145. That's the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While I could try to haggle Alice down a few more dollars, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $145. Accepting this offer saves me $5 compared to buying from John and avoids the risk of Alice raising her price in further negotiations."
