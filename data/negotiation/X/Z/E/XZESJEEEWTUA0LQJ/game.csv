"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110.",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm really interested in this product and think this would be a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,115.0
"I like your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I think the product's value is worth a bit more than $105. I'm willing to meet you at $115, as I mentioned earlier, but I can also consider going to $112.50. Let me know what you think.",112.5,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $112.50.  I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  To make this work, I'd need to come in at $107.50.  I'm really eager to get this product and believe this price reflects its value fairly.",107.5,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,110.0
"I understand you're eager to get the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $107.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $107.50 and $112.50, which would be $110. Let's call it a deal at that price.",110.0,Alice,7,,
