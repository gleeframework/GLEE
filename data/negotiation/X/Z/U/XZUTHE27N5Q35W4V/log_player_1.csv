Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met his maximum valuation of the product. While we could continue negotiating and trying to get more, there's a significant risk he'll walk away. Accepting his $1,000,000 offer guarantees a sale at a price still exceeding his perceived value.  

Holding out for a potential extra $200,000 (by selling to John) isn't worth the risk of losing Bob and potentially getting a worse outcome in later rounds."
