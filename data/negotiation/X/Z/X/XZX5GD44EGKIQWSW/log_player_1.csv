{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** It leaves you room to negotiate down if Bob doesn't accept.
* **It's close enough to your minimum:** This ensures that if Bob is willing to pay close to your minimum, you can still make a good profit.

**Remember:** You have the option to walk away and sell to John at any time. This gives you leverage and allows you to be confident in your negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, you're still better off rejecting it and seeing if you can push for a higher price. You have a few factors in your favor:

* **John's offer:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000. This gives you leverage and allows you to be more aggressive in your negotiations with Bob.
* **Potential for compromise:** There's still a $1,000 gap between Bob's offer and your minimum. You can try to bridge this gap with a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $13,000 and $14,000.  This shows Bob that you're willing to negotiate, but you're also not desperate to sell at his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $13,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to where I need to be. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer splits the difference between your previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($13,000). It shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Still above your minimum:** You're still earning more than your minimum of $15,000 with this offer.
* **Strong message:** The message is positive and encourages Bob to accept.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! You've successfully negotiated a good price.
* If Bob rejects, you can either:
    * Make another counteroffer, perhaps closer to $13,000.
    *  Sell to John for $15,000 if you're not confident in getting a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below your target. You have a few reasons to reject and try for a better price:

* **John's offer:** You still have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000. This gives you leverage to hold out for a better deal.
* **Potential for compromise:**  There's still room for negotiation.  You can potentially get closer to your target price with a counteroffer.
* **Risk of settling too low:** Accepting this offer means you're leaving $1,750 on the table.  It's worth pushing for a bit more, especially considering John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

Make a counteroffer to Bob, likely closer to $13,500.  This demonstrates you're still willing to negotiate, but you're not going to accept a price significantly below your minimum. If you're not confident in getting a better price, you can always sell to John at any time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit higher than $13,250, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $13,375. This price is fair to both of us, and gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13375}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer splits the difference between your previous offer ($13,500) and Bob's offer ($13,250). It shows you are willing to compromise to reach an agreement.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  You're still leaving some money on the table, but it's significantly less than if you accepted Bob's previous offer.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes the desire to reach a deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! You've negotiated a fair price.
* **If Bob rejects:** You can either:
    *  Make another counteroffer, potentially closer to $13,250. 
    *  Sell to John for $15,000 if you're not confident in getting a better price from Bob. 

Remember, you have the option to sell to John at any time, so don't be afraid to walk away if you're not happy with the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,375. I'm willing to go up to $13,250, but that's as high as I can go. Let's meet at $13,250, or I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer is still below your minimum, and while there's always a chance you can push him further, it's becoming clear that he's not willing to budge much.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum. It's not worth risking further negotiations with Bob, especially considering the potential for him to walk away and you to be left with no buyer at all.

**Why Sell to John:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer guarantees you your minimum price, ensuring you don't lose money.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could waste valuable time.  Selling to John ensures a quick and profitable transaction.
* **Limited Upside:** It's unlikely that you'll be able to get a significantly better offer from Bob, and you risk losing him entirely.

**Next Steps:**

Contact John and finalize the sale. You've successfully negotiated a profitable deal without compromising your minimum."
