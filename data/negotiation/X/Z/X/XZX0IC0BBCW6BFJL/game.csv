"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay up to $850,000 for this product, based on my own assessment of its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking that we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $1,200,000. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I can't justify going above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below your target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking that we're getting close to a fair price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, which is $975,000. However, I'm also considering the urgency of selling this product, and I'm not sure if I want to go through another round. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at $975,000.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're eager to sell, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really pushing my budget here, but I'm willing to go to $950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not sure if I want to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to a fair price. I'd be willing to meet you at $980,000, which is just $20,000 above your last offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal.",980000.0,Alice,7,
