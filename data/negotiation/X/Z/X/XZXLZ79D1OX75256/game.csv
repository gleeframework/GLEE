"Alice,  while I appreciate the value you're placing on this product,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth to me.  Let's start our negotiation from here.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, I must emphasize the unique value this product offers. It's worth significantly more than your initial offer in the long run. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,600,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging its true value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,600,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm firm on my initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price for the product, and I'm not willing to go any higher.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
