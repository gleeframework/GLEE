"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate the value you're placing on this product,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth to me.  Let's start our negotiation from here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, I must emphasize the unique value this product offers. It's worth significantly more than your initial offer in the long run.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,600,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm firm on my initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price for the product, and I'm not willing to go any higher.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Bob is holding firm at his valuation, but we still have room to negotiate and time before accepting his offer or going with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. This product has the potential to generate significant returns, even beyond your initial valuation. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

We're starting to increase the pressure a bit here. By stating this is our final offer, we're hoping to incentivize Bob to negotiate more seriously. However, by still offering a price significantly above his, we're leaving room for him to counter without feeling like he's losing face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,400,000 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a critical juncture in the negotiation. Bob is holding firm, and now stating his offer is final. It's unlikely he'll go above $1,000,000. 

```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

While we could continue negotiating with Bob, it's risky. He's shown no willingness to budge, and we risk losing John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer. It's better to take the guaranteed profit than potentially walk away with nothing if Bob refuses to budge."
