Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have a strong second buyer interested."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential:** Since Bob values the product at $800,000, there's room to negotiate above that price.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 gives you a strong position to push for a higher price with Bob.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" and a ""second buyer,"" you incentivize Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid losing out on the product. 

By starting high, you give yourself room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your guaranteed sale price to John."
