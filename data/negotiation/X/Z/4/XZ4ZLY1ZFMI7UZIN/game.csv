"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $7,500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $6,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $7,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $6,500. Would that be possible?",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $6,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $6,800. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",6800.0,Alice,5,
