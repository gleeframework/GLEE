"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  Considering the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,500,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's potential, I understand your perspective. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the value it holds for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and hopefully allows us to finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
