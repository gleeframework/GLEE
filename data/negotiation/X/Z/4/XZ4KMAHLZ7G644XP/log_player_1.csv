{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer aims to find a compromise between my minimum desired price and Bob's perceived value. It gives Bob a good deal, while still allowing me to earn a significant portion of the value I place on the product.  If Bob rejects, I can still get my minimum desired price from John."
