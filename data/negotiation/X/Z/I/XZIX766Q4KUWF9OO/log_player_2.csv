Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 is too far off for me to accept.  Let's make this our final offer: $1,500,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:**  Alice has presented her last offer as ""firm.""  She's made it clear that $1,500,000 is her absolute bottom line.
* **John offers a better deal:** Buying from John for $1,200,000 saves you $300,000 compared to Alice's final offer.
* **Time is a factor:**  Further negotiation with Alice is likely to be fruitless.  It's more efficient to secure the product from John at a favorable price."
