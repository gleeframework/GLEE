"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $2,000,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your position, $1,000,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider a price of $1,750,000.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget. I could go up to $1,100,000.  If that's not workable, I might have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 is too far off for me to accept.  Let's make this our final offer: $1,500,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
