# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is higher than the $1,200,000 you can get it for from John.  Since your goal is to save money and you have a guaranteed alternative at a lower price, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
