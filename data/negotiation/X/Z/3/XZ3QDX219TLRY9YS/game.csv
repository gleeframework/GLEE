"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $18,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this product is worth every penny.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks great, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll offer you $15,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",15500.0,Alice,5,
