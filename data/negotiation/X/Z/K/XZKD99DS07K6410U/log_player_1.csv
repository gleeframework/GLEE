Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially earn more than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get a bit more from Bob. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my desired price, and even lower than John's offer.  I'm going to sell to John to guarantee a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
