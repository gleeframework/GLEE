"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. How about we consider $1,900,000? This feels like a fairer point to continue our discussion.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $1,900,000 is still way too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a serious offer, and I hope you consider it.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for working with me on this. I see we're making progress.  While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a significant gap from what I need. To be frank, I have another potential buyer, but I believe in giving you a fair chance. Would you be willing to consider $1,600,000? This feels like a compromise where we both might find agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still unable to go above $1,100,000. This is a final offer from me, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
