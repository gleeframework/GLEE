"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely do better.  Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best initial strategy."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to pay $975,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 975000}

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable. Let's try $950,000. This is getting very close to my budget, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get closer to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,015,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd like to get the price even lower, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation. Accepting Alice's offer at $1,015,000 is still a good deal for me.  It's significantly lower than John's price, and I'm saving a considerable amount of money. There's a risk that Alice might reject my counteroffer in the next round, and then I might have to buy from John at a much higher price. It's better to secure this deal now and avoid that risk."
