{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is very close to Bob's maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $1,150,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's offer and puts pressure on her to negotiate. This price still leaves room for further negotiation while staying within Bob's budget."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's initial budget, but still leaves room for negotiation.  While Jhon is a reliable alternative, Bob is trying to minimize costs.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a compromise. He increases his offer from the previous round, showing a willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is a significant decrease from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit and is within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still more than he wants to pay.  At this point, Bob has been negotiating for several rounds and hasn't been able to get a price lower than his maximum. It's better for Bob to accept the guaranteed price from Jhon and avoid risking further rounds of negotiation that might not yield better results."
