"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a great product, but I have to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant discount, and a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000, but I really think $1,200,000 is the most I can afford.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,250,000 is still too low. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while being within your reach. Let's make this deal work.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I think I can do better than that. Can we try $1,220,000?",1220000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,220,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to go down to $1,320,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",1320000.0,Alice,7,
