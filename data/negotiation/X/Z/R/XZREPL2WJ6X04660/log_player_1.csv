Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a great product, but I have to stay within my budget.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000, but I really think $1,200,000 is the most I can afford.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not enough. I'm willing to keep negotiating for a better price, as I have a good backup option with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,250,000 is still too low. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while being within your reach. Let's make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I think I can do better than that. Can we try $1,220,000?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'll try to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us.  I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since I have a guaranteed offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,220,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to go down to $1,320,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,290,000, but I think I can do better than that. Can we try $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable value.  I've tried to negotiate, but it seems he's not willing to meet my price.  Rather than risk further rounds of negotiations that might not lead to a profitable outcome, I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees me a sale at my desired price, and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
