"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $82? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both agree on.",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $78?",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $78 just isn't going to cut it for me. I'm willing to come down to $80, which is the absolute minimum I can accept.  Let's make this happen!",80.0,Alice,7,
