Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a significant discount. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice is now matching John's price, and there's no guarantee she'll go any lower. Accepting avoids the risk of further negotiation and secures the product at the desired price."
