"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept right away. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for more. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. This keeps the negotiation moving and allows me to explore if there's a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
``` 

I'm offering $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and also John's offer.  This shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price but am also willing to walk away if necessary."
