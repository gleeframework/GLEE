{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $130, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not going for the full $150 right away. This gives Bob the feeling he can get a better price and keeps him engaged in the negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own. I'll always keep in mind that I have a backup buyer in John who's willing to pay $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even below my initial offer of $130. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is still interested and has shown willingness to pay more than his initial valuation.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to getting a fair price and keep the negotiation going. This also positions me to make a counteroffer that may be closer to my desired price. 

**Next step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $120? This is a great deal considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising but not giving in:** I'm lowering my price from $130 to $120, demonstrating flexibility and showing Bob that I'm open to negotiation. However, this is still well above his initial offer of $100.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** I'm not dropping to his price immediately, as it would set a bad precedent and make it difficult to negotiate further.
* **Positive and encouraging:** My message emphasizes the value of the product and frames the offer as a good deal for Bob.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my desired price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make another counteroffer. I'll always keep in mind my fallback option of selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still significantly lower than my ideal outcome.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate and is getting closer to my desired price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting his offer, I can potentially push for a higher price, perhaps by offering a compromise between $110 and $120. 

**Next step:** I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price slightly higher than $110 but still within a reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer splits the difference between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $110. It shows that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the fairness of the offer and highlights the value of the product.
* **Final push:** This offer is likely my last concession before considering selling to John. 

**Next steps:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects, I'll likely sell the product to John for $150, as further negotiation may not be fruitful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $115. How about we try $108? I'm getting close to my maximum budget, and I really want to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While Bob is now offering $108, this is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited potential for improvement:** Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price that meets my minimum.  
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing a guaranteed sale.

**Next step:** I will sell the product to John for $150, as it's the best outcome for me at this point."
