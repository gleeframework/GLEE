"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,175,000? This price reflects the value you gain while acknowledging the significant benefits it offers.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
