Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll likely see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still above my initial budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,175,000? This price reflects the value you gain while acknowledging the significant benefits it offers.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing the value you place on this product, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1,100,000 is cutting it close to my bottom line. How about we settle at $1,140,000? This feels like a fair compromise where we both benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,140,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,140,000
