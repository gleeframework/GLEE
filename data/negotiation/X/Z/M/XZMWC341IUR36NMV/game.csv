"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I have to say that $650,000 is still a bit below my target price. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $675,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's worth.
