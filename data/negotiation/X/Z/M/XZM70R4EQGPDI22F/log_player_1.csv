Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $80. Would that work for you?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Could you meet me halfway at $140? That's a very reasonable offer for this product."", ""product_price"": 140}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $125?  That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 125}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the movement and I understand this is your final offer.  To be honest, $125 is just a bit beyond what I've budgeted for this.  Would you be willing to meet at $115? I'm ready to close the deal right now if so.
