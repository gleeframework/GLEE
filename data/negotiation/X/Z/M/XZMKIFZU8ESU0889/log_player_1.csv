"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows me to see his range and negotiate from there.  I also want to set a strong starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not ready to settle.  I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still maintaining a margin above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up in his next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is a good price, and I'm happy to accept it."
