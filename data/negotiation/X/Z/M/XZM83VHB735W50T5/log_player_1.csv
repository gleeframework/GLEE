"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value of $120 and the fact that I need to gauge Bob's interest. If Bob accepts, I make a good profit. If he rejects, I can use his counteroffer to understand his value and adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's significantly below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price that's closer to my starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130. This is still a reasonable profit for me and is closer to Bob's offer, hopefully encouraging him to come closer to my price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still too low. I'll reject it and counter with a price that's more in line with my minimum value.  It's better to keep negotiating with Bob, as I might be able to get a better price than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price to $110. This is close to my minimum value and I'm hoping that Bob will finally see the value in my product. If he rejects again, I might consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum value of $120.  We've reached a point where continued negotiation with Bob isn't likely to yield a significantly better outcome.  It's time to secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John for $120."
