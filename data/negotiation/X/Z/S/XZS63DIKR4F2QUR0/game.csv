"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it and the effort I've put into creating it. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $9500.  This gives you a good price and still keeps me within my budget.  Let's seal the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I'm not willing to give up too much more. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer you a slight discount. I'm offering the product to you for $10200. This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it and the effort I've put into creating it. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10200.0,Alice,5,
