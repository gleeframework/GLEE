# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you! This product is a rare find and I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. I'm thinking of starting at $120.

Round 3

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to go to $105?  I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is tempting, I'm still aiming to save as much as possible.  There's still room to negotiate, and it's worth trying one more time to see if we can land at a price closer to my ideal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm very close to your offer.  How about we split the difference and go with $106.25? It's a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 106.25}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I'm getting closer to my goal, Alice's offer is still above my maximum price.  It's becoming clear that we won't be able to agree on a price lower than $108.  Given that John offers the product for my maximum price of $100, it's more advantageous to buy from him and save $8."
