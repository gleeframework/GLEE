"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $155? It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $145? This would be a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $155 might still be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. How about we try $152? It's a small compromise, but it's still a great deal for both of us.",152.0,Alice,5,
