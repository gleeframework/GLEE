Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or cut my losses and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet. I believe the product is worth more and I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping he sees this as a fair price and accepts. If not, I'll have to decide if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'm going to accept his offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a good deal considering the alternative of selling to John for $1,000,000."
