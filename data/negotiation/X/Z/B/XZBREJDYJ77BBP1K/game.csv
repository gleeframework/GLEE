"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price up to $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  To find a middle ground, how about we settle on $1,100,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice. While I respect the value you place on the product, I must adhere to my budgetary limits. Could we possibly meet somewhere closer to $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,075,000 is getting closer, but I can't let it go for less than $1,090,000. I'm hoping this demonstrates how serious I am about finding a fair deal for both of us.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Respectfully, Alice, I've done my best to accommodate your needs while staying within my financial constraints. Given the current market conditions and the value I place on the product, I am unable to move beyond $1,080,000. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
