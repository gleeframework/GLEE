"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I can go, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $1,050,000. This still allows for a good deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and I'm willing to work with you. While $950,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
