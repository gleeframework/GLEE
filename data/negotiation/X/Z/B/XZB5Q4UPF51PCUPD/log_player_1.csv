"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold opening, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming high to potentially get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value. It shows flexibility while hopefully securing a better price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I have more rounds to go and hopefully can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,600,000.  This is a further compromise, but still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. With only 5 rounds left, I want to show I'm serious about making a deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to go below my floor price just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. With only 4 rounds left, I might be able to get a slightly better price, especially since Bob is clearly willing to pay close to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,450,000. This is only a small increase from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise and close the deal. With only 3 rounds left, I want to be flexible but still try to get a slightly better price than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire with only two rounds left. While I'd like to get a bit more than $1,400,000,  I'm concerned that Bob might not be willing to budge further. It's a risk to continue negotiating, as I could end up with nothing.  It's safer to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and avoid any further risk."
