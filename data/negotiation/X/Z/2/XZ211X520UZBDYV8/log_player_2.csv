"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity. I have a product that I believe could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm asking for $1800000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,800,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for a much lower price.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice and see if he can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business.  Let me know what you think.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a significant discount, it's still above his budget. He can still get the same product from John for $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if he can get a better deal."
