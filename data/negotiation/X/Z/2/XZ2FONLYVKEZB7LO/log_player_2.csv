"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product, which is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering you'll be getting a product that's worth so much to you at a price that's still below its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
