"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $105 is closer to what I need, it's still a bit low for me.  How about $110?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",110.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the highest I'm willing to go.,108.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that.  However, I need to make at least $110 on this sale. Would you be willing to go up to $110? I'm confident you'll be happy with the product, and this is the best I can offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
