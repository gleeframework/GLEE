"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm not quite ready to commit to $800,000. I'm confident the product is valuable, but I need to ensure it aligns with my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $750,000, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $725,000? It's a fair price that's within my budget, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $725,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still hoping we can find a more agreeable price. How about $750,000?  This would allow us to finalize the deal, and I'm confident you'll still make a profitable sale. Let's see if we can close the gap.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate at this point. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $790,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",790000.0,Alice,7,
