{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached a point where the negotiation is getting close to the end, and Alice is not budging much further. It's time to consider the alternative.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, he's already gone through several rounds and it's unlikely Alice will go any lower.  John's offer is a guaranteed deal at a price that's significantly lower, and with only one round left, it's the safer choice to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
