"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Can you meet me in the middle?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I value our potential partnership, $7000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $8500, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $8000. Can we meet at this price?",8000.0,Bob,4,
