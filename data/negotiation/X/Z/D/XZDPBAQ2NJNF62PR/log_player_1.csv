"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation and signals that you value the product. 
* **Closer to Bob's Valuation:** While staying well above your minimum, starting closer to Bob's perceived value increases the chance he'll engage seriously.
* **Leaving ""wiggle room"":**  The offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a better deal as the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good profit, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob's offer suggests he's very interested and willing to move significantly from his initial perception of the product's value. There's a good chance we can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I believe this product has the potential to bring you even greater returns. Would you consider $1,200,000? I'm confident this would be a wise investment on your end."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're coming down $100,000 to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but not too much too soon.
* **Highlighting Bob's Benefit:** By emphasizing the ""potential returns"" for Bob, we're keeping him focused on the product's value rather than just the price.
* **Confident Tone:** Using language like ""wise investment"" reinforces the idea that this deal is beneficial for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations.  I can do $1,050,000 today to get this done. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Momentum:** Bob's counter-offer only moved up $50,000, indicating his willingness to negotiate further might be slowing down.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this offer, we can gauge Bob's determination and see if he's willing to come closer to our desired price point. 
* **Time Still Available:** We still have several rounds to go and can afford to push a little harder, especially since we have the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,050,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer shows we're serious about finding a middle ground but not willing to go below a certain threshold.
* **Finality:** By stating it's our ""best offer,"" we signal that further haggling might not be productive. This could push Bob to make a more serious move.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We're reiterating the value proposition to remind Bob of the potential benefits, justifying the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. To be honest, $1,150,000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,100,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,100,000 is a significant profit, well above both our minimum and John's offer.
* **Finality:** Bob has labeled this his ""final offer,"" signaling he might not be willing to negotiate further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we *might* squeeze out a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's also a risk Bob walks away. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome."
