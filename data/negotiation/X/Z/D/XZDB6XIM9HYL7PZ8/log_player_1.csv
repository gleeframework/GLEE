"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives me a good margin and leaves room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, he may be willing to pay a bit more to get it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's initial offer, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to offer $100. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I believe Bob might be willing to meet it after rejecting my previous offer.  I'm hoping to close the deal before having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I've already had several rounds of negotiation and it's getting risky to keep going.  I'm going to sell to John for $100. This guarantees me a fair price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
