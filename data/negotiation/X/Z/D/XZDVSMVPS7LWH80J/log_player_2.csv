"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to try and negotiate, especially since we don't know Alice's minimum selling price.  By rejecting the offer, we can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $75?  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I understand you're on a budget.  $75 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $85? That's still a good deal for you, and it lets me get closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $100 to $85.  This is a good deal considering I can get it from John for $100.  It's worth accepting and saving $15."
