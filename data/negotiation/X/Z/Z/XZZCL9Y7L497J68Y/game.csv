"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120, which is a good compromise. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $120 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, but I really need to get closer to my asking price. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $125, and I think that's a fair compromise. What do you say?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $125 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $127.50, but this is my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to waste any more time. Let me know if you're interested.",127.5,Alice,7,
