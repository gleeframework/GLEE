{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay, it's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the initial offer allows me to start the negotiation process and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to meet Alice halfway, knowing that her minimum is $10,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I still believe I can negotiate a lower price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $10,750. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my target. I believe this offer is reasonable given that Alice has already lowered her price and I'm willing to move closer to her asking price."
