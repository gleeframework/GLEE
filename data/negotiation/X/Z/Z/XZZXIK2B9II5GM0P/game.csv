"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1500000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1300000 for this product. Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1300000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1100000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1100000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $1250000 to make this deal work. Let's find a solution that's fair to both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1250000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1150000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
