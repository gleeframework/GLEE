Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $710,000. This is the last concession I can make, so I hope we can come to an agreement.

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Alice is signaling this is her final concession, and the price of $710,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks alienating Alice and forcing you to go with John's less favorable price."
