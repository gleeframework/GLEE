"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal and I think you'll be very happy with it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's tempting to get the deal done, you can potentially get a better price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $10,000, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  That's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer.  While you are getting closer to your desired price, you can likely still do better.  Remember, you can always purchase from John for $10,000, so there's no need to rush into a deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $11,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This feels like a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's tempting to meet in the middle, you're still closer to your desired price of $10,000, and there are still rounds left to negotiate. You can try to push Alice a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to go up to $11,100. This is a fair price that allows us to both walk away happy and close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up in price.  $11,100 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price to reflect the value of this product. How about $11,150? This is a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away satisfied with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy the product from John. At this point, you've gone through multiple rounds of negotiation with Alice, and the price is not getting closer to your desired price.  The deal with John is a guaranteed price that matches your maximum budget."
