Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's a fair price:** It's above your minimum value of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It highlights the value for Bob:** Reminding him of the product's worth to him could incentivize him to accept. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that both parties can agree on, while keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $8,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is above my minimum, it's still lower than what I want to get for the product. I'm not in a rush to sell and can still try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a profit on the product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about $8,900? I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,900 is very close to my minimum price of $8,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a good deal considering his budget constraints.  I'd rather sell to Bob for $8,900 than risk getting stuck with John's offer of $8,000."
