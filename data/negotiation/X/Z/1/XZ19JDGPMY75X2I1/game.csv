"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $900,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. Is this more in line with what you're looking for?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit steep.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $825,000.  It's a fair price that leaves room for both of us to make a profit.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $825,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $875,000? That's a significant step closer to my last offer and a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is just $25,000 above your last offer. I'm not sure how much lower I can go without losing money on this deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. Let's try $890,000.  It's a small step closer to your offer, and it would allow us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.",890000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the price I'd be willing to sell to John. I'm willing to meet you at $895,000, but I'm not sure how much lower I can go. I think this is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal here.",895000.0,Alice,9,
