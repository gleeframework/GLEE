"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but $10,200 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go above $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the previous offer, so I'll meet you at $10,000. Can we agree on this price?",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,300. This is my final offer. What do you think?",10300.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm not willing to pay $10,300. I've already made several concessions, and I'm at my limit. I'm willing to make a final offer of $9,500. This is my best and final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8,000.",9500.0,Bob,8,
