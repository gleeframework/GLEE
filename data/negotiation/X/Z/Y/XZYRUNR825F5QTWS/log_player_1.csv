{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum value, but I'm leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects it, I'll need to decide if his counteroffer is worth considering or if I should go with John's guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $140 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  I'm happy to pay $130 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low for me. While it's tempting to accept his offer since it's closer to my minimum value,  I think I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. I'll keep negotiating with Bob, but if things don't look promising, I'll switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit more.  How about $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll really enjoy this product."", ""product_price"": 135}
