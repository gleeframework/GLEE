"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $135 to make it worth my while. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",135.0,Alice,3,,

"I see you're getting closer to my target price, Bob. However, I still need a bit more to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $140? I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",140.0,Alice,5,,
