"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $600,000 is a good deal, but there's potential for a better price.  By rejecting, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price and save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This aims to push Alice towards a lower price point quickly, while still demonstrating Bob's interest in the product.  It's a risky move, but it could lead to a faster and more favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer. While there's still room for negotiation, accepting this offer saves Bob $250,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a solid deal that balances potential savings with the risk of losing the product to another buyer."
