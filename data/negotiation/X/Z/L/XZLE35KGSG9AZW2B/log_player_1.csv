Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $600,000}

I'm starting with a relatively low offer, hoping to leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not willing to sell the product for $500,000, which is $300,000 less than its value to Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $550,000}

I'm making a moderate counteroffer, trying to find a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer."
