"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is friendly and focuses on the potential benefit for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not going all-in with my first offer, leaving space for Bob to counter. 

I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate, and potentially get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.**  Even though it's closer than his initial value, I'm not willing to sell for that price right now.
* **I have more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better price.** I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher.

I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $11,250 for the product. This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not giving up completely. Instead, I'm making a counter-offer to show I'm open to negotiation.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm suggesting a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing that the new price is a ""fair deal"" for both of us, encouraging Bob to see the value in accepting.

I hope this counteroffer will convince Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $10,875? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,875 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** While I'm running out of time, I still have a few rounds left. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.

I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $10,875 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's aim for a number that's fair for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price to $11,000, and I hope you'll meet me halfway. This will allow me to close the deal while still getting a reasonable return on my product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing I'm still willing to negotiate.
* **Small Concession:**  I'm dropping my price slightly from $11,250 to $11,000, showing flexibility. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm highlighting that this price is ""fair for both of us,"" aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of a good deal.
* **Urgency:** I'm mentioning ""closing the deal"" to create a sense of time pressure.

This counter-offer aims to inch closer to my minimum acceptable value while still being within a range Bob might be willing to accept."
