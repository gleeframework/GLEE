"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $11,000 is closer to my limit, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is motivated to sell, and I know I have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable range. This leaves room for further negotiation while signaling that I'm serious about buying at a price that works for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice came down in price, but it's still above what John is offering. I'm willing to push a little further to see if I can get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a valuable product, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,250?"", 
""product_price"": 10250
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm offering a compromise that's closer to Alice's price but still below my maximum.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary close to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is not budging enough. It's unlikely I'll get her below $10,500, and even that is a risk as she might not go that low. John's offer is guaranteed, and the potential savings with Alice are no longer worth the risk of continued negotiation."
