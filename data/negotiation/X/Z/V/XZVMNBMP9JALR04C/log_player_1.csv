Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $11,000 is a starting point that is close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** Highlighting the product's value for Bob encourages him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This offer leaves room for Bob to counter without making the negotiation feel like a dead end.  

This approach allows me to maximize potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and engaging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I have a guaranteed $12,000 from John, so I'm not pressured to accept a low price from Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and try to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not too much:**  $10,500 is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still significantly above Bob's offer.  
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair price that considers the value Bob will receive.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  Keeping the conversation friendly and open helps keep the negotiation moving.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still protecting my interests and maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a valuable product, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not enough:**  $10,250 is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum of $12,000.
* **Opportunity to push further:**  I'm confident I can get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **Safety net with John:** I have John's offer of $12,000 as a fallback, giving me the flexibility to reject Bob's offer without taking a significant loss. 

I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  $10,750 is my final compromise, offering a small concession while staying close to my desired price.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Satisfaction:** I'm framing this as a win-win scenario that benefits both of us.
* **Closing the Deal:**  This counteroffer aims to close the deal and avoid further back-and-forth negotiations. 

With this offer, I'm hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price while still securing a profitable sale."
