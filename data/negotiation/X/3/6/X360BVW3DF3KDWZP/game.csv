"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. I propose we aim for a more reasonable price closer to $950,000. I hope this suggestion is within your consideration.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
