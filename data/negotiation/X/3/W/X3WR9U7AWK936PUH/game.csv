,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob! However, $10,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a price of $12,000",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm serious about buying this product, but I need a price that works for me. To show I'm willing to compromise, I'll offer $10,500. That's my final offer.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your seriousness, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, but so do I. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but that's really the best I can do. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to seriously consider my other options.",10750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'll meet you at $11,250, but that's as low as I can go",11250.0,Alice,9,
