"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
