"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but not excessively so. This gives us room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I still have time to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $11,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's last offer.  I believe this shows good faith in the negotiation while still leaving room for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a slight improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a further compromise, but it's still a fair price considering I'm willing to sell to John for $10,000.  I'm hoping this shows that I'm serious about closing the deal, while also ensuring that I get a profit for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $10,200. This is a small concession but it shows I'm serious about closing the deal with Bob. At this point, I'm very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $10,000.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, we're running out of time.  It's clear that we're not going to agree on a price that meets both our needs.  Since John is offering my minimum, it makes sense to close the deal with him and avoid further negotiations."
