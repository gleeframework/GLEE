"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $77, so I'll offer it to you for $81.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $81 is a fair price that keeps me well under my $100 limit. There's no guarantee I could get it lower, and it's not worth the risk of losing the deal."
