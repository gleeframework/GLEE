"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $10,500? This would still give you a great deal, and we could finalize the deal quickly.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could we settle at $9,750? That feels like a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,750 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $10,125? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. Let me know what you think.",10125.0,Alice,5,
