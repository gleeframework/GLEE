Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $10,500? This would still give you a great deal, and we could finalize the deal quickly.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could we settle at $9,750? That feels like a fair compromise."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,750 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $10,125? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000. She's consistently countered with prices closer to your limit, and $10,125 is a strong signal that she's trying to maximize her profit.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $10,000, there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice. You'll save $125 by going with John."
