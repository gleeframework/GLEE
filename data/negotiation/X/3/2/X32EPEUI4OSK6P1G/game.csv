"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about we meet in the middle at $107? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make this work.",107.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your minimum price, but $107 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again. How about $106? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",106.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $108? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",108.0,Alice,5,
