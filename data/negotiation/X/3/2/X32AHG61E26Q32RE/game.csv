"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would like to hear your thoughts on this counteroffer.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 falls short of my minimum expectations.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,000,000? This would still provide you with a strong return on investment while allowing me to achieve a fair price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account both our interests. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",950000.0,Bob,4,
