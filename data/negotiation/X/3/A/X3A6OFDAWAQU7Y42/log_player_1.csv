"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're beginning with a strong anchor price significantly above both our valuation and Bob's. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows us to secure a deal closer to our desired outcome. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  The initial offer is also designed to gauge Bob's level of interest and willingness to negotiate. His response will give us valuable information for our next move.
* **John as Leverage:** Having a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,200,000 gives us a strong fallback position and allows us to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget, I would like to propose a price closer to $800,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both our valuation and our initial offer. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss. While his counteroffer was expected, it's important to demonstrate that we're serious about a higher price point. We'll use our next counteroffer to try and bridge the gap strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,400,000. This reflects the value while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from $1,600,000 to $1,400,000. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price well above both Bob's offer and our minimum.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value and framing the lowered price as a strategic decision to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Observation:**  We'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. A substantial counter from his side would indicate room for negotiation. A minor adjustment or holding firm at $800,000 might suggest exploring our alternative with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your proposal. I understand the value of the product, but I am still working within a specific budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,100,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is getting interesting! Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000 shows he's willing to move significantly from his initial offer. However, it's still $100,000 below John's guaranteed price. 

We need to apply a bit more pressure to see if we can push Bob closer to our target. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation alive while signaling that we have other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer demonstrates serious interest, but we're still a bit apart.  To be transparent, I do have other potential buyers for this product. However, I value our discussions and believe we can reach an agreement.  Would you consider $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Scarcity:** We're subtly bringing up the existence of other potential buyers (John). This introduces a sense of scarcity and competition, potentially motivating Bob to be more flexible.
* **Final Compromise:** Our price of $1,250,000 is a strong compromise:
    * It's $50,000 above our guaranteed offer from John, giving us a potential profit.
    * It signals that we're nearing our bottom line, encouraging Bob to make a decisive move. 
* **Open to Negotiation (Slightly):** While this is positioned as our final offer, we've left a slight margin to accept a counteroffer if Bob comes very close to $1,250,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $1,150,000. I hope this brings us closer to a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to call it a day with Bob. Here's why:

* **Stalled Negotiation:**  Bob increased his offer, but only by $50,000. This suggests he's unlikely to reach our $1,250,000 target. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a cost. We're potentially missing out on other deals or uses for our time.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John represents a guaranteed $1,200,000. While selling to Bob at a higher price would be ideal, it's not worth risking the sure thing for an uncertain outcome.

While we could counter again, it's unlikely to result in a significant jump from Bob. Accepting John's offer secures our minimum acceptable price and allows us to move forward."
