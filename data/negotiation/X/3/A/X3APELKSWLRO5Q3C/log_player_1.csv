Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $1,500 by selling to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $9,500 leaves room for negotiation (if Bob tries to haggle) while still securing a significant profit.
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not explicitly mentioning John, there's a subtle implication that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act. 

This approach aims for the highest potential profit while maintaining a good chance of securing a deal with Bob."
