Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer than my initial offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that the product is truly worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not sure if he'll go higher.  John is offering me the same amount, so it's safer to sell to him and avoid the risk of a longer negotiation with Bob."
