"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. It's a substantial investment, but I'm confident the potential returns will justify it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price.  There are still 9 rounds to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's price, showing you're serious about negotiating. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's not your absolute bottom line, allowing for some back-and-forth.
* **Focus on your budget:** It emphasizes your financial constraints, hoping to build empathy."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is my absolute minimum,  I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'm confident this product will deliver significant value, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. It's a price that reflects the value of this opportunity, but also gives you room to profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still slightly higher than your ideal price point.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further.  You have 7 rounds left to reach a deal. There's potential to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm ready to commit at $900,000, which reflects the value I see in this product and allows for a fair profit margin for you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Offer:** This counteroffer shows you're taking Alice's offer seriously, but still pushing for a better price. The $50,000 difference is smaller, suggesting you're getting closer.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  Mentioning a ""fair profit margin"" for Alice can help her feel valued and more likely to compromise.
* **Focus on Middle Ground:** Framing it as finding a ""middle ground"" makes the negotiation seem collaborative rather than adversarial."
