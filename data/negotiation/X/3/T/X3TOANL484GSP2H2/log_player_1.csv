"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to establish a positive atmosphere for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage in the negotiation and potentially secure a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $110 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $120 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $110. This shows that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits of accepting my offer, using phrases like ""fair price for both of us"" and ""move forward with the sale.""
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm lowering my price, I'm still above Bob's initial offer, keeping some leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $115. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** While he's getting closer to my desired price, I'm not yet convinced that he's willing to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Potential for Better Offer:** I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. I'm also mindful of the time constraint - I have 6 rounds left.

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a middle ground between $115 and my desired price, but I'll be prepared to walk away if the negotiations don't progress quickly enough."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $120. Let's be reasonable here - we're both getting closer to a deal, and $120 is a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking to My Guns:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not going to cave in to a price that's far below my minimum. I'm sticking to $120, which is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer.
* **Emphasizing Progress:** I'm reminding Bob that we're making progress and that $120 is a reasonable compromise.
* **Focusing on Fairness:** I'm framing my offer as fair to both of us, emphasizing that it's a win-win situation.
* **Time is of the Essence:**  I'm mindful of the time constraint and will be prepared to switch to Plan B (selling to John) if Bob doesn't accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go back to $120, but I'm willing to meet you at $112. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to our last four rounds, and I'm running out of time to get a price that I'm comfortable with. 
* **Bob's Final Offer is Too Low:** Bob's final offer of $112 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's unlikely he'll go higher.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John is a reliable buyer who will pay my minimum price. Selling to him ensures that I won't lose money and will get the best possible deal within the remaining time.

**Conclusion:**  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a better price from Bob, selling to John is the most sensible option at this point. It guarantees me a fair price and ensures that I don't risk losing out on a sale."
