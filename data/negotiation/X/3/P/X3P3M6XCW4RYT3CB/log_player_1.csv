Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that allows for negotiation. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for compromise. 
* **Message:** This is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to Bob. It avoids being too aggressive while showing confidence in the asking price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Starting high:** Setting a high initial price allows for more negotiating room and potential for a higher final price.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone can encourage Bob to keep negotiating. 
* **John as a backup:** The knowledge that John is willing to pay $10,000 provides a safety net and allows Alice to be more assertive in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and below the value I've placed on the product ($10,000). 
* Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, but I'd prefer to see if I can get closer to my desired $12,000.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired $12,000,  but acknowledging his willingness to pay more than $8,000.  This shows flexibility while maintaining my goal of maximizing the sale price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a fair price for the value this product will bring you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, but not by much. I'm aiming for a middle ground that still gives me a good profit.
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to encourage him to accept.  I'm also remaining positive and open to further negotiation.
* **Strategy:** My goal is to find a price point where Bob is willing to accept, while still ensuring I earn close to my desired price. The possibility of selling to John for $10,000 gives me leverage in these negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer. I could do $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum.** While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, Bob's offer of $9,000 is only $1,000 less.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could result in Bob lowering his offer even further, potentially below my minimum threshold.
* **Time is money:**  Prolonging the negotiation could cost me valuable time and potentially lead to a lower price if I have to sell to John as a last resort.

**Conclusion:**

It's a calculated risk, but I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale at a price that's close to my minimum."
