"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $850,000?  That still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still finding it hard to justify that price. Let's try this - how about $775,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about getting this deal done.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and your desire to reach a deal. While I'm willing to be flexible, I can't go lower than $800,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and ensures I can meet my own financial goals.  Let's see if we can find a compromise at this level.",800000.0,Alice,5,
