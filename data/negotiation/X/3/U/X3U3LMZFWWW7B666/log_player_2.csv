Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a significant amount, and hopefully a good starting point for us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, $950,000 is still above your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $950,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that shows I'm serious about acquiring this product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975000. This is a good compromise that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $975,000, which is closer to your budget, but still slightly above your desired price point.  It's worth seeing if you can push for a lower price before you consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll offer $925,000.  This is a fair compromise and a strong final offer from me."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975000 is still too high, I'll meet you at $950000, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $980000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $980,000, which is still outside of your budget. You've already made several counteroffers, and there are only a few rounds left. Given that John is offering the product for $800,000, it's best to stop negotiating with Alice and purchase from John. You'll save a significant amount of money in the long run."
