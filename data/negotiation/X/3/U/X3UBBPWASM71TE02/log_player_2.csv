"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you at a special price, knowing its worth to you.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to gauge how much you value the product. While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, potentially pushing her closer to her $8,000 valuation."
