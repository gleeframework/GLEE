"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. My initial offer for the product is $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is out of my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. Let's meet in the middle at $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $13,500? It's a good compromise and closer to my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $13,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $14,000, which is $13,500. Let's see if we can make this work.",13500.0,Alice,7,
