"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $18,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price closer to $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $18,000 represents the high-end of its value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet closer to the middle at $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but I think we can do better. Can you consider $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a fair price.  It seems like we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $15,000? That feels like a win-win to me.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which would be $13,750. Can you consider that?",13750.0,Bob,6,
