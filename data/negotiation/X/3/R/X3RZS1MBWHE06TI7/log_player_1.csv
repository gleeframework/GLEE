Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $18,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price closer to $15,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $18,000 represents the high-end of its value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet closer to the middle at $16,500?"", ""product_price"": 16500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but I think we can do better. Can you consider $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which would be $13,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While holding out for a higher price is tempting, Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground. Accepting his offer of $13,750 secures a profit of $3,750, which is a reasonable outcome at this stage of the negotiation.  

Waiting longer carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or even walking away.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk ending up with John's $10,000 offer."
