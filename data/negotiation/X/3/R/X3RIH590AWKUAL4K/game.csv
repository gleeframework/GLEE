"I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to drop to $950,000. This is a very fair price given the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
