"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a special price of $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting at this price to reflect the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000 and Alice is offering the product at the same price, there's no room for negotiation to save money.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy from John at the same price, but he retains the option to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice if she counter-offers."
