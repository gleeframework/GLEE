{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $8,500. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me, hoping to get as much as possible.  I'm also being friendly and confident in my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $8,500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,500 is still more than the product is worth to me, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $7,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save a bit more. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $7,800 is still close to what I want and it's more than what I would get from John. This seems like a fair compromise and I'd rather close the deal than risk going back and forth with Bob further."
