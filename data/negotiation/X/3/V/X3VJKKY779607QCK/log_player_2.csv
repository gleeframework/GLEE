"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can get the same product from John for $100, so anything less than that is a good deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I had a higher price in mind, I could be willing to meet you halfway.  How about $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

While $90 is better than $95, it's still more than what you're willing to pay. You can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
