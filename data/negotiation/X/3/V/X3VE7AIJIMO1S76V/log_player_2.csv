"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is far above my budget of $8,000.  It's too risky to accept at this point. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is way out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000 right now.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $12,000. This is my final offer in this range. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still too high for my budget. I'm still willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go above $9,000. It's the absolute maximum I can afford right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're being cautious with your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need to make a profit. This is my final offer in this range. If you're still interested, let's discuss the details.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I want to try and see if I can get even closer to my maximum of $8,000.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000, but I'm still a bit stretched at that price. I'm really hoping we can make this work.  I'm ready to pay $9,500.  I believe that's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to my budget, but Alice is still above my desired price.  It's clear that we're not going to find a middle ground in the remaining rounds.  Since I'm not willing to pay more than $8,000, it's time to move on and purchase the product from John. It's guaranteed to be within my budget."
