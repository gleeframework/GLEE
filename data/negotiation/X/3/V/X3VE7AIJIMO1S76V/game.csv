"I have a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is way out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000 right now.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $12,000. This is my final offer in this range. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go above $9,000. It's the absolute maximum I can afford right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're being cautious with your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need to make a profit. This is my final offer in this range. If you're still interested, let's discuss the details.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000, but I'm still a bit stretched at that price. I'm really hoping we can make this work.  I'm ready to pay $9,500.  I believe that's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,7,
