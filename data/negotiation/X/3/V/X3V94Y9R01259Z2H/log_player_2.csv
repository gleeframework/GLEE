"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm hoping to get it for closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum price of $10,000.  This demonstrates that Bob is serious about negotiating but also allows room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still confident in its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,250 is a good price, Bob is still determined to save more.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit further.  Would you be willing to go to $10,750?  That's still a good deal for you, and it would make this purchase work for me."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is a good compromise. He has moved closer to Alice's last offer, but still offering a price that is lower than her latest offer. This demonstrates flexibility and commitment to the negotiation, while still pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,100. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision. Bob is getting closer to his goal of $10,500, but the price is still higher than he'd like. However,  it's likely that Alice won't go any lower.  Considering the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal, it's better for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product for a price that is significantly lower than John's price."
