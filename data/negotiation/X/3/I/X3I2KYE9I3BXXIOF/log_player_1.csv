Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, knowing you have John as a backup.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering slightly below your maximum allows for the possibility of Bob countering with a higher price, still within your acceptable range.
* **Appear Reasonable:** Starting too high might discourage Bob completely. Offering a price somewhat above his perceived value, but presented as a ""deal,""  increases the chance he'll consider it."
