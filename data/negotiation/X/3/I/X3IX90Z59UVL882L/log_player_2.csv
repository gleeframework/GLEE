This is a high-quality item that we believe is worth every penny, and I'm confident it will meet your needs perfectly. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I think this is a fair price. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

The product is worth $120 to both Alice and Bob, and John is offering the same price. There's no incentive to negotiate with Alice."
