"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm open to negotiation but my starting price is $15000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",12800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $12800 is tempting, I'm still trying to recoup the significant investment in this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13200. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13200 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12500 is simply too low for me to accept.  This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it's worth more to you than that. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $12900. This is my absolute bottom line, and I'm not willing to go lower. If you're serious about making this deal happen, this is your last chance. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",12900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $12900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12400. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. Can you consider this offer?",12400.0,Bob,8,
