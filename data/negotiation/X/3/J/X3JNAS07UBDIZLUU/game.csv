"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I believe it's a great product, but I'm on a budget.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $17,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'd be willing to go up to $15,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,4,
