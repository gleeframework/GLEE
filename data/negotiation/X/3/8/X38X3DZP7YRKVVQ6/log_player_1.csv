Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's valuation of $8,000, giving me a good profit.  It's also lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation if Bob isn't happy.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will get, making the offer more appealing.  

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize potential profit:** $12,000 is a good starting point for negotiation. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to meet in the middle for a mutually beneficial price.
* **Avoid risk of rejection:** By offering a price lower than my ""John"" fallback, I'm minimizing the chance of Bob rejecting the offer outright, leaving me with my guaranteed $15,000 sale."
