Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. With that in mind, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment.

I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to work with you to finalize the deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $1,000,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

We're now consistently making smaller concessions. At this point, the difference is relatively small, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. Accepting at $1,025,000 secures a good deal without risking the entire negotiation by pushing further."
