# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a reasonable profit for me. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this offer.

Alice has come down to $1,350,000. This is a good price for you as it's within your budget and saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John."
