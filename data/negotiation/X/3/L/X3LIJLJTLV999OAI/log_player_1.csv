Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. I'm confident it's a fair price considering its potential, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **Above your minimum:** It's higher than your minimum of $1,000,000, giving you room to negotiate.
* **Reasonable initial offer:** $1,500,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving space for both parties to move towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** By stating you're ""open to negotiation,"" you signal flexibility and encourage Bob to engage in the process. 

This approach allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a favorable deal while keeping the option of selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum, considering my current financial situation and the potential value I see in the product.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is a decent offer, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a price closer to my minimum.  Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still allows for a good profit margin for me while being more within your budget. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the unique value of the product. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This counteroffer strikes a balance:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It's above Bob's $800,000, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate but not drastically lowering your price.
* **Lower than your initial offer:** It's lower than your initial $1,500,000, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Reasoning provided:**  The message justifies the price with ""unique value"" and ""fair compromise,"" making the offer more persuasive.

This approach maintains your position while offering a more reasonable price, increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1200000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit out of reach.  I'm confident I can get a good deal with John for $800000, but I'm still interested in your product.  I'm willing to go up to $900000 if you're open to it. This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, I've already made two concessions and am starting to feel like Bob is being stubborn.  The possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000 is a good opportunity, and I don't want to risk getting stuck in a lengthy negotiation with Bob."
