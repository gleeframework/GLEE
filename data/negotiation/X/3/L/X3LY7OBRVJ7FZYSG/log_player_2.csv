"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential returns it can bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is above her valuation ($1,100,000 vs. $800,000), it's still significantly lower than your maximum price and what John is offering ($1,100,000 vs. $1,200,000). Accepting this offer saves you $100,000."
