Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $100? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $75 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $90, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's meet halfway and see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down, the price is still significantly higher than John's offer. It's unlikely Alice will go as low as $80, so it makes more sense to cut negotiations short and buy from John."
