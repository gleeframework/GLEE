Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $800000.  This represents a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
