"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique and valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still higher than her actual value for the product.  There's room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. I want to see if I can push the price down further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This represents a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met me halfway, and the price is now well within my budget and below my maximum willingness to pay.  While I could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk she'll walk away, and I'll have to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer is the best option for securing the product while saving a significant amount of money."
