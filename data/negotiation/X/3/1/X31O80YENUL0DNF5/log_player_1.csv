Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to try to get a higher price from Bob. $100 is too low, even though it's more than he initially thought the product was worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"

I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counter with another offer, seeing if we can reach a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $105 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's a step closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've done my research, and I know this product is worth a lot less than what you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $105. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum, and I've only got a few rounds left. I'm not confident I can get a better price from him. It's best to guarantee my minimum profit by selling to John."
