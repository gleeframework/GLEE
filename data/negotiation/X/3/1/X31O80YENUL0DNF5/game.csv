,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $105 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's a step closer to what I need.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've done my research, and I know this product is worth a lot less than what you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $105. That's my final offer.",105.0,Bob,6,
