"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was hoping to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the product's inherent value.  While $1,200,000 is my absolute bottom line, I'm confident we can find a price that benefits both of us. How about we settle at $1,300,000? This reflects a more equitable split of the potential value we both see.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,300,000 is your bottom line, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Considering the product's value to me is worth no more than $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I propose a price of $1,250,000. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
