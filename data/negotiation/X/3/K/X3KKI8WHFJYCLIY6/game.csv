"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint and I'd like to be as close to it as possible.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
