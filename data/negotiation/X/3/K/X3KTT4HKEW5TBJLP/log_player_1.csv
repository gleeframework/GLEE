Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  Any amount over this is a bonus for you.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at a higher price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's significantly above Bob's perceived value but still attractive enough that he won't want to risk losing the deal.

**Possible Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm confident it will be a significant asset to you.  I'm offering it at $1,100,000. This offer stands for 48 hours, after which I will be moving forward with another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're positioning the product as desirable and exclusive.
* **High Anchor:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, setting a strong initial point.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** The limited-time offer and mention of another buyer create a sense of urgency and scarcity, making Bob less likely to stall or lowball.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Be prepared to adjust if Bob counter-offers.  Having a clear understanding of your minimum and your desired outcome will help you negotiate effectively.
* **Relationship:** Consider if maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is important long-term, as aggressive negotiation tactics can sometimes backfire."
