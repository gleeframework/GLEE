"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to find a fair deal, $900,000 undervalues the product's true potential. Could you consider $1,050,000? I'm confident this price reflects its worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you think the product has more value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth more than $900,000. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher.",950000.0,Bob,4,
