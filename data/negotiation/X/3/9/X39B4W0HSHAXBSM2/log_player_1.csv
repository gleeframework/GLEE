Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $600,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I'll try to counter-offer and see if I can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still leaves me room to profit, but it also shows my willingness to negotiate with you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $725,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price by counter-offering. I still have several rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
