You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Alice a fair profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still higher than my desired price. I will continue to negotiate to try and get a better deal. The risk of buying from John is a factor, but I still have time to improve Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,150,000. This shows that I am serious about buying the product but also that I'm still willing to negotiate. Alice's previous offer suggests she's willing to come down a bit, and I'm hoping this counteroffer will incentivize her to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While the negotiation is getting tougher, I'm still confident I can get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal.  There's still time to improve Alice's offer, and I'm not ready to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, but it's still within my budget and leaves room for Alice to make a profit. This demonstrates my commitment to closing the deal, while also putting pressure on Alice to accept a price closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still too high. With only 3 rounds left, I want to be strategic. I'm confident I can get a better price.

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems unwilling to move significantly lower, but I'm not ready to settle. Rejecting her offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final push. I'm increasing my offer to $1,250,000, which is still a significant saving for me and leaves a decent profit for Alice. With only two rounds left, I need to show my willingness to close the deal while also maintaining a strong negotiating position. If Alice rejects this offer, I will be forced to accept her final counteroffer or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my limit, but it's still higher than I would like to pay.  With only one round left, it's unlikely we'll reach an agreement that benefits both of us. It's a tough decision, but given the limited time and potential for further negotiation failures, buying from John for $1,500,000 is the most sensible option. It guarantees I get the product and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
