{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price a little, but I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell for less than $10,000. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired amount and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop the price to $9,250.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and I'm confident that I can still make a profit on the sale.  I'm willing to accept his offer and move forward with the transaction."
