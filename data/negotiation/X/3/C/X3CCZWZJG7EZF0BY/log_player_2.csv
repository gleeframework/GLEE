{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice's offer is $950,000.  There's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting allows for a counteroffer.**  You can try to lower the price and potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, we are willing to consider an offer closer to your suggested price. Therefore, we propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she moved closer to your counteroffer, $900,000 is still above your desired price point.  
* **Further negotiation is possible.** You can still make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.  
* **Buying from John is not the best option at this point.** You can likely get a lower price from Alice with continued negotiation."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your desired price.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000 and Alice's offer is $890,000.  
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price.** While you could continue to counteroffer, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.  
* **Accepting the offer is the most prudent decision.**  It allows you to acquire the product at a favorable price without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
