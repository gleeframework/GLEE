"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the market value and still leaves me a decent profit. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to at least get $11,000 for the product. This price is still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on it. Let's find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my asking price. However, I'm still not able to go below $11,000. This price reflects the product's true value, and it's still a great deal for you considering you're willing to pay $10,000. I believe we can close this deal if we both compromise a little.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still not willing to go above $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me halfway. How about $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,6,
