,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $102.50 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $102.50, which would be $98.75. That's my final offer.",98.75,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as high as $98.75. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $102.50 and $98.75, which would be $100.625. It's still a great price for the product, and I think it's a fair offer.",100.625,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and my previous offer of $98.75, which would be $99.375. I think that's a fair price for the product.",99.375,Bob,8,
