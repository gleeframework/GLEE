"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $80?  It's a fair price and I'm confident I'd be a happy customer.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $80. I appreciate your willingness to make a deal, but I was really hoping to get a bit more for this product. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $85? It's still a great price, and I think you'll really love the product.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  Unfortunately, $85 is still a little more than my budget allows.  I'm happy to stick with my previous offer of $80.  It's a fair price and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",80.0,Bob,4,
