"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the product's value significantly exceeds that figure, making your offer unfeasible. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $950,000. This reflects a substantial adjustment on my part while still recognizing the true worth of what's being offered.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $950,000 is still more than I had budgeted for this purchase. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart on price. I've received a very strong offer from another interested party, and while I'd prefer to do business with you, I need to be realistic about my options. My final offer is $875,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I need a decision from you this round to move forward.",875000.0,Alice,5,
