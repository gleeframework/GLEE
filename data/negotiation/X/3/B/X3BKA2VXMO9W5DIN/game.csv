"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $100. Would you be willing to consider that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit out of your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I'm still looking to stay closer to $100 if possible.  How about $110?  That's a good compromise for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close to $100 as possible, Bob. However, I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I can only go down to $125. That's the lowest I can go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",125.0,Alice,5,
