Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a significant discount from his perceived value of the product while still allowing me to make a substantial profit. It's a starting point for negotiation, and I'm ready to adjust if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I believe I can still achieve a higher price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,000,000, which is still a good profit for me, but it demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to achieve a price closer to my desired range."
