"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this item, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $110 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $120.** You want to save as much money as possible. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better price.**  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:**  This shows Alice you're serious about getting a lower price, while also leaving room for negotiation.
* **Stay within your budget:** $95 is still within your maximum price of $120, leaving you some wiggle room if needed.
* **Be polite and direct:**  Use a friendly tone while clearly stating your price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $95 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your ideal price.** While it's lower than her initial offer, you can likely get it down further.
* **You have more rounds to negotiate.**  There's no need to rush into accepting a price that's still higher than your desired goal. 
* **Counteroffering shows you're committed to getting a better deal.** By rejecting and counteroffering, you demonstrate your seriousness and can potentially push Alice further towards your price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increase the offer slightly:** You've moved closer to Alice's offer, showing willingness to compromise while still staying within your budget.
* **State it as your final offer:** This creates a sense of urgency and might prompt Alice to accept.
* **Reiterate your commitment to a deal:** The final sentence emphasizes your desire to close the deal, encouraging Alice to consider your offer."
