Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good price.  $95 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  This still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
