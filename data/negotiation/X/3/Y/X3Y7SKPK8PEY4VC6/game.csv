"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a little too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 still isn't quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. Let's make this happen.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
