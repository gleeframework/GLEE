"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with my maximum price, hoping Bob will accept it. If not, I have 9 rounds to negotiate and can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
``` 

I'm lowering my price by $100,000, aiming to find a middle ground while still securing a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now getting closer to my minimum value and I have limited time to negotiate. It's better to secure a sale now than to risk losing both Bob and John by being too stubborn."
