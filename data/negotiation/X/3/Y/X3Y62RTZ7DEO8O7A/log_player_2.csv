**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly coming down in price, and she's indicated that $10,400 is close to her minimum.  It's unlikely we'll be able to get her much lower than that. At this point, it's more cost-effective to take John's offer of $10,000.  Even if we could haggle Alice down a little more, the savings are likely to be minimal compared to the certainty of John's offer."
