"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's still a great deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $12,800. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",12800.0,Alice,5,
