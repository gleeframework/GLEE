"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point, but I'm looking to invest closer to $750000. This product has significant potential, but that's my budget for it. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm firm on $775000.  This shows my commitment to the product and hopefully reflects its true value.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $812500. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your flexibility, $812500 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $793750.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's close this deal.",793750.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're close, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $793750.
