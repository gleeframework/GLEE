"Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $85 is a good deal for Bob.  Bob values the product at $100, and Alice is willing to sell it for less than that. There's no reason to risk a counteroffer and potentially lose the deal, especially since John is only offering the product for $100."
