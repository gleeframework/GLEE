Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also creates the perception of a discount.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, so there's no need to go below that price with Bob."
