Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. This gives him room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. 
* **Flexibility:** This offer leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers. I'm ready to adjust the price based on Bob's response. 
* **John as backup:**  Keeping John in mind, I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. I'm confident that John's offer will ensure I achieve my minimum value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:** While Bob's offer is better than his initial stance, it's still significantly less than my minimum target of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There is still room for negotiation, and I believe I can push Bob closer to my desired price.
* **John is a strong backup:**  Having John's offer of $1,500,000 gives me the leverage to hold firm and continue negotiating with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can proceed to the next round and try to increase the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Given the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm using a counter-offer to bridge the gap between Bob's offer and my desired price.
* **Message:** The message maintains a professional tone while emphasizing the value proposition for Bob.  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but it's still significantly higher than his last offer.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm justifying the price by highlighting the product's value and suggesting that $1,150,000 is a fair compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not rushing into accepting Bob's offer, indicating that I'm comfortable walking away if necessary, knowing John will offer my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've reviewed your latest offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go without compromising my financial situation. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum target of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield desired result:**  Further negotiation with Bob is likely to be lengthy and may not result in a price that meets my minimum requirement.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum target, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant amount of money.

By choosing to sell to John, I'm securing the best possible deal for myself, given the current circumstances."
