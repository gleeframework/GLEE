"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that my product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to go up to $10,500.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy the product today.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,800. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10800.0,Alice,5,
