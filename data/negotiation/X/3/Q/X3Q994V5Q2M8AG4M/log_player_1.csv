Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $135. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $125 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale altogether.  It's better to secure a sale at this price than risk getting nothing at all."
