"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to take advantage of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can always buy from John as a backup if the negotiation with Alice fails."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, your initial price is out of my range.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I can still negotiate further and potentially get a better deal. I'm not willing to pay more than $1,000,000, so I will reject her offer and try to get her closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,200,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to offer you $1,050,000, which is a significant amount and reflects the value I see in this product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you closer to your target, but I still need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me. I'm not willing to go above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. Given that John is offering the product for exactly that amount, it makes more sense to buy from him and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
