"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, your initial price is out of my range. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its potential value to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,200,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to offer you $1,050,000, which is a significant amount and reflects the value I see in this product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you closer to your target, but I still need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
