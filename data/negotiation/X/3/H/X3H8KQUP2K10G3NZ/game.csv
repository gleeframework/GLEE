"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500?  This still leaves you a good amount of profit, and it's a fair price for the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to $10,500, Alice.  While I think the product is great, $10,000 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
