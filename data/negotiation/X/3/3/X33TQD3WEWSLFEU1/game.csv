"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident it's worth the investment.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.  This price still gives you a good deal, while allowing me to get a more fair return on my investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm going to make this my final offer.  I'm willing to lower the price to $1,075,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll be forced to sell the product to another buyer.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
