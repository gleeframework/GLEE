"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident it's worth the investment.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You want to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is too high. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.  This price still gives you a good deal, while allowing me to get a more fair return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what you're willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a lower price. You're still within your budget and have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm going to make this my final offer.  I'm willing to lower the price to $1,075,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll be forced to sell the product to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is making her final offer, and while it's still above your initial target, it's getting closer. It's a good deal considering you're already past halfway through the negotiations. It's also important to consider the risk of Alice selling to another buyer and losing the product altogether. You can save $25,000 compared to buying from John, making this a worthwhile deal."
