"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to save as much as I can.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to save, but $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, which would be $97.50. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
