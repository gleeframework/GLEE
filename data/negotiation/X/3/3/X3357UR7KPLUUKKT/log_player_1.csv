{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a good profit while still being within Bob's perceived value. It leaves room for negotiation, but it's also a good starting point. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter with a lower price, but I'll always keep John's $8,000 offer in mind as my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if I can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price still gives me a decent return on my investment, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $7,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,500 is too low for me. I'm not comfortable going lower than my minimum of $8,000.  Therefore, it's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $8,000."
