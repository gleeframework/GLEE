"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $10,500. This still allows me a small profit, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
