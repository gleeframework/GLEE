{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value ($80),** giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price ($120),** leaving space for potential concessions. 
* **It's a clear and concise message,**  making it easy for Bob to understand. 

By offering $100, I am hoping to secure a fair price while keeping the negotiation open.  I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $80 for this product. Would you consider selling it to me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to go down to $95. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it's still above your budget, but I'm hoping we can reach a compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I've decided to counter Bob's offer with $95.  

Here's why:

* **It's a compromise:**  It's closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **It's still above my minimum:** I'm not willing to go below $95 yet.
* **It keeps the negotiation going:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm interested in reaching a deal. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to entice Bob to accept the deal. If not, I'll be ready to make a final decision based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm glad you're willing to lower your price. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could you consider selling the product to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is still too low. While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $120.  Since I can sell the product to John for $120, that's the best option for me at this point."
