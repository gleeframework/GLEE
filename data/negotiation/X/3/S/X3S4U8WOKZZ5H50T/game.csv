"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  Could you possibly do $7,750?  That's a significant discount from my original offer.",7750.0,Alice,5,
