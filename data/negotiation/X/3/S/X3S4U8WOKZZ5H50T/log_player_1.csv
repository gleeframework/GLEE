"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,500 is closer, my budget is firm.  Would you be willing to do $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  Could you possibly do $7,750?  That's a significant discount from my original offer."", ""product_price"": 7750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I need to stick to my budget.  Would you consider $7,200?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly holding firm to his budget. While we could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely we'll reach a price that's significantly better than $7,200. Accepting John's offer of $8,000 guarantees the best outcome at this point."
