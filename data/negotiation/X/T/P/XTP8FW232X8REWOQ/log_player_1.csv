Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your fallback position.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's appealing to Bob while maximizing your profit.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to be a bit bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting closer to your minimum, but leaving room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Time Pressure:**  The mention of ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Emphasis:** While not stating a specific figure, reminding Bob of the ""unique value and potential"" reinforces the product's worth.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $1,400,000. He might counter-offer, or he might decline altogether. However, this strategy gives you a strong starting point in the negotiation."
