I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000. However, it's not so high that it would likely scare Bob away immediately. 

I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy based on his reaction."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is better than selling to John, but I think I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise between my original offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and we can reach an agreement."
