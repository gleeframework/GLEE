"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $18,000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm prepared to offer $13,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for negotiation.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16,000 for the product. This is my best counteroffer so far.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price.  My final offer is $14,000. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $17,000 for the product. This is my last concession before we reach the upper limit of my willingness to sell.",17000.0,Alice,5,
