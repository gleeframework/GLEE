``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than what Bob values the product at, but lower than what I value it at. It leaves room for negotiation, but also demonstrates that I'm serious about selling it to him.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to counter if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I think the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for a price that undervalues the product. I believe I can get a better price with a counter-offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,050,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 
I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding firm on a value closer to what I believe the product is worth. This shows flexibility, but also indicates that I'm not going to give it away. I believe this counter-offer gives Bob a fair price while allowing me to still make a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,150,000, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,075,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. The product is worth more to me than that.  I'm confident I can still get a higher price with a counter-offer, especially since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000 as a backup.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for a price that undervalues the product."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,075,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to other options. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm making a slight concession to show good faith, but I'm firm on this price. I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away if he rejects it. I'm confident I can still get a better deal with John as a backup. This counteroffer is a final attempt to find a compromise, but it's also a way of testing Bob's seriousness about buying the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not willing to go that high. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,075,000. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to move on. Bob has made it clear he's not willing to meet my minimum price.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I can't afford to lose out on such a significant amount of money.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's the best option for me at this point."
