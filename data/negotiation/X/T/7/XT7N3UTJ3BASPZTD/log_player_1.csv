{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing it as a good deal for Bob.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer. 

This strategy allows me to maximize potential profits while also keeping the negotiation open for a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly below my minimum valuation of $150. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it indicates his willingness to negotiate. This creates an opportunity for a counteroffer.
* **John is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $150, so I'm not under pressure to accept a drastically low price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and aim to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $175. However, $125 is still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired range.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm still emphasizing the value of the product and presenting it as a ""great deal"" for Bob.
* **Openness:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking Bob if he's interested. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $125 is still a little steep. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While $100 is closer to my desired range, it's still my absolute minimum valuation for the product. 
* **John's offer is better:**  John is willing to pay $150, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer. This is a better financial outcome for me.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will accept a counteroffer, and further negotiation could lead to a lower price or a prolonged process.

Selling to John minimizes risk and ensures I receive a price that is at least at my minimum valuation."
