"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can definitely do better than $10,000.  The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but I'm thinking $9,000 is a more fair price given its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9500.  This is a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive:** $9,500 is a good price for Bob, as it's below his maximum price of $12,000 and leaves some room for profit.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, Alice has already shown a willingness to come down from her initial price. There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Alice withdrawing the offer entirely. 
* **Buying from John is riskier:** Buying from John for $12,000 is more expensive and offers no potential for saving money.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $9,500 is the best option for Bob."
