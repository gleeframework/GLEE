"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm ready to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,120,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1120000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,120,000. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement in the next few rounds.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
