Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's value of $12,000, but below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It leaves room for negotiation, potentially allowing me to secure a higher price or at least provide Bob with a good deal that he might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am able to offer $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This would give us both a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but based on my budget constraints, I can't go above $13,000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has been firm on his offer of $13,000. While that is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal.  Given that John is willing to pay my full asking price of $15,000, it makes more sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
