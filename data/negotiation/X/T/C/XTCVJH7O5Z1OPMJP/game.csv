"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be very valuable to you. Let me know what you think!",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic. How about we start at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a more reasonable price.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $800,000?  That's the highest I can go.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to work with you, but we need to find a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm prepared to go down to $1,000,000, and I believe that's a realistic figure considering the benefits you'll receive.  If we can't reach an agreement, I may have to consider other offers, as I do have a potential buyer who is willing to pay my asking price.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
