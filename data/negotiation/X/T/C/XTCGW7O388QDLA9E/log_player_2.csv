# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better price. He should counteroffer and see if he can get closer to his ideal price before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is below my bottom line. Would you consider $1,350,000?

Bob should accept Alice's offer. It's a good price considering his goal is to save as much money as possible and it's still within his budget. Accepting this offer will save him $150,000 compared to buying from John."
