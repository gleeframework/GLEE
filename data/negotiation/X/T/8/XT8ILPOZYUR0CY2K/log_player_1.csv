"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product, I'll start by making an aggressive offer. However, I also want to leave some room for negotiation, so I won't go too high.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but still higher than the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($800,000), I'll consider it. However, I'm not sure if I want to settle for $850,000, especially since I have the option to sell it to John for $1,000,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $850,000, and I want to increase the price, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer, but still lower than my initial price of $950,000.
