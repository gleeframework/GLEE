"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $16,000. I believe it's a fair reflection of what it can do for you.",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $6,000 is significantly below its value.  I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I hope it shows how serious I am about purchasing this product.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I need to be fair to the value of this product. $7,000 is too low.  Let's settle at $12,000, my absolute bottom line.",12000.0,Alice,5,
