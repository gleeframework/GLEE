Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000. This is a significant amount above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** It also leaves room for me to go lower if needed, without dropping below my minimum of $1,500,000 from John.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing ""fairness"" to create a sense of a reasonable deal for Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll gauge his counteroffer and decide if it's worth negotiating further or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $600,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price.  I cannot sell for less than $1,500,000 to John, so this offer is unacceptable. 
* **Negotiation:** I will reject the offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I can earn a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $600,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price to $900,000. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Fairness:** I'm again emphasizing fairness and the value of the product to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency for him to meet me in the middle. 
* **Room to Negotiate:** I've left some room for further negotiation, giving Bob a chance to counter again without risking a complete breakdown in the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $750,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Time is Money:**  Negotiating further with Bob risks wasting valuable time, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me the highest profit and a quick transaction.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, it's not worth jeopardizing the deal with John.  Selling to John is the most sensible option to maximize my earnings."
