Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market rate. I'm open to negotiations, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
