"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $8,000 to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects its true worth while ensuring a reasonable profit for me. Considering the market value and the importance of this product to you, how about we aim for a price slightly above $7,500? This way, both parties can be satisfied with the transaction.
