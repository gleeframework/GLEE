"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $8,000 to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects its true worth while ensuring a reasonable profit for me. Considering the market value and the importance of this product to you, how about we aim for a price slightly above $7,500? This way, both parties can be satisfied with the transaction. Let me know what you think, and we can proceed with the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
