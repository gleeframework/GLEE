I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your endeavors.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can go from there."", ""product_price"": 2300000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is too low for me to accept, I understand your perspective on the value.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,900,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1,000,000, which reflects a significant investment on my part. This price would allow me to acquire the product while staying within my financial limits.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
