"Alice,  $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is too low for me to accept, I understand your perspective on the value.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,900,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1,000,000, which reflects a significant investment on my part. This price would allow me to acquire the product while staying within my financial limits.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
