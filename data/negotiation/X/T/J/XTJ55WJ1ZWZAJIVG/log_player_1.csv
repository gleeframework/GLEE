Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the benefit to Bob (""great deal"") and avoids aggressive language. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open. 

This strategy allows for a potential win-win scenario while maintaining my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price:** While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $12,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can likely get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **John's offer provides a safety net:**  Having John as an alternative buyer gives me the leverage to reject Bob's offer without being overly concerned about losing the sale.

I'll counteroffer Bob with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming to meet him halfway, while still getting closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  How about $9,500? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Maintaining leverage:** It's still slightly above Bob's offer, reminding him that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the fairness and the opportunity for both parties to get a good deal.

This counteroffer maintains a negotiation dynamic while giving Bob a chance to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9,250? That's the best I can do, and I hope it's something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $9,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** I believe there's room for more negotiation.  I can try to meet him halfway again, or even hold firm on my previous offer.
* **John's offer provides a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob without being forced to accept a lower price.

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly closer to his offer, aiming to get to a deal that's acceptable for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference one last time.  How about $9,375? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9375}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer. It demonstrates a willingness to find a solution while still holding onto some of my desired profit.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  The message focuses on the ""fair compromise"" and ""good deal"" for both parties, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Final Offer Implication:** While I'm open to further negotiation, this offer is positioned as a final compromise, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to accept or risk losing the deal. 

This approach aims to find a mutually acceptable price while maintaining my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,375. I've already stretched my budget quite far, and I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm willing to make one final offer: $9,000. That's the absolute limit for me. If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  Even with his final offer, the price is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **No more negotiation room:** I've already made several concessions and have reached the point where further negotiations are unlikely to yield a significantly better price.
* **John's offer is a sure thing:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, ensuring that I don't lose out on a profitable deal. 

Given Bob's unwillingness to move further, selling to John is the best option to secure a price that meets my minimum requirement."
