"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a great value at that price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,250.  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you think?",8250.0,Bob,4,
