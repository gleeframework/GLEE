I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price.  $9,000 is too low for me at this point, and I think I can get a better offer from Bob."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm starting to get a little nervous about losing this deal, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  $8,800 is getting too close to what the product is worth to Bob, and I want to try and get a bit more from him.  I'm still optimistic that I can get a better deal in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer is getting too low.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $12,000.  While it's not the ideal outcome, I'll still make a good profit and avoid potentially getting a worse deal from Bob."
