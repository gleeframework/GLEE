"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider a lower price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've done my research and I know that this product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to go down to $825,000, but that's as low as I can go.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While I believe this product is valuable,  $825,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference closer to your last offer - would you consider $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I've already gone down from my initial offer of $950,000 to $825,000, and now you're asking me to go down to $760,000. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $760,000, which would be $792,500. I think that's a fair compromise.",792500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we've both moved a bit on price.  To get this done, I'm willing to go up slightly from my last offer.  How about $780,000?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $785,000, which is just a $5,000 increase from your last offer. I think that's a reasonable compromise, considering the value this product holds for you.",785000.0,Alice,7,
