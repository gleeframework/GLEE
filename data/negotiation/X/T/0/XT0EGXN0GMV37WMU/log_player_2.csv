"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $100 is within his budget, it's not the best deal. He has more rounds to negotiate with Alice and might be able to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob is aiming to be aggressive but not unreasonable. Offering $85 is a significant discount from Alice's $100, but still above Alice's perceived value of $80. 
* **Reasoning:** Bob justifies his offer by highlighting his budget constraints and demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Next steps:** Bob hopes to secure a deal at this price, but is prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a deal for 92. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counter:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, but she's still asking for more than Bob wants to pay.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  He's willing to continue negotiating to try to get a better price. 
* **Jhon's offer:** While Jhon's offer is a fallback option, Bob is still confident he can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit high.  Let's split the difference. How about $88?  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** Bob is now offering a price that is the middle ground between his previous offer of $85 and Alice's offer of $92. This shows that he's willing to compromise and meet her halfway.
* **Fairness:** He emphasizes the fairness of his offer, aiming to appeal to Alice's sense of reason. 
* **Continued Negotiation:** Bob is still confident he can get a better deal than John's offer of $120, so he's willing to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go below 95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we try 90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in:**  Alice is now at $90, which is only $10 more than Bob's last offer of $80.  
* **Time is a factor:**  This is round 5, meaning Bob has limited rounds left before he has to buy from John.
* **Balancing risk:** Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price within his budget. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might become more resistant, and he could end up having to pay John's $120."
