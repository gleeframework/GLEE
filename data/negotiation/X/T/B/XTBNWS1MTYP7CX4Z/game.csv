"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than we initially discussed, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you, and it's closer to my minimum price.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I can go. I'm going to offer you $15,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and your minimum price.  Let me know if you're open to it.",15000.0,Bob,4,
