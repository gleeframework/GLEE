Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $86.25. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $86.25. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The goal is to save as much money as possible, but also to buy the product.**
* Alice's offer of $86.25 is within your budget of $100.
* While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer again, and you might end up buying from John at $100. 
* Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a lower price than John's offer."
