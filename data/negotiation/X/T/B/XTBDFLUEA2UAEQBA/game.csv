,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $87.50. Let me know what you think.",87.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,
