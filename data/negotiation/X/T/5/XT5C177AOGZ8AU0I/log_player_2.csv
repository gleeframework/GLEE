"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think might be of interest to you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable in your hands. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
