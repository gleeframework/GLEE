I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. If Bob rejects, I can see if he's willing to come closer to my desired price range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and might be enticing to Bob. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still value the product highly."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation and a higher price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I think I can get a better price from Bob."

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $9,200 is a good price, considering I was initially aiming for $10,000 and my minimum is $8,000.  It's time to finalize the deal and avoid risking going lower with more rounds of negotiation."
