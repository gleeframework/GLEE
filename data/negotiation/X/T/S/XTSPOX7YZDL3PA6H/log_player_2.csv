# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire a remarkable product that holds significant value to both of us. Given its exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, I believe it's worth more than just monetary exchange. However, for the sake of negotiation, I propose a price of $12500 for the product. This figure represents a strategic midpoint between its intrinsic value to you and my asking price, aiming to ensure mutual satisfaction. I look forward to discussing this further and potentially making this valuable asset yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.
