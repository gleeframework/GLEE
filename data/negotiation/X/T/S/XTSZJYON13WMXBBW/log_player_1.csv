Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable.  I believe it's worth a significant amount to both of us, so I'd like to start the conversation at $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above my minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,150,000 offer allows for some back-and-forth with Bob.  If he counters, I can gauge his seriousness and adjust accordingly. 
* **John as a Backup:** I always have the option to walk away and accept John's $1,000,000 offer if negotiations with Bob become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000 for this product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my minimum selling price, but it's still a significant distance from my initial ask.  By rejecting his offer, I signal that I believe the product is worth more. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of undervaluing the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. It seems we both see the value in this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've countered by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($1,150,000) and Bob's offer ($1,050,000). This signals a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I've reiterated that we both see the value in the product, subtly reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This counter-offer keeps me above my minimum selling price and allows for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we're getting closer.  I'm still feeling a little high at $1,100,000. How about we split the difference at $1,075,000?  That would be a great price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Profit:**  While not my ideal price, $1,075,000 is still a significant profit over my minimum ($1,000,000) and a reasonable compromise. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or reaching an impasse. Accepting now secures the deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal sooner rather than later allows me to reinvest the proceeds and potentially generate further returns."
