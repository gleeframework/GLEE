Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000. Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a price above your baseline.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is designed to gauge Bob's interest level. By mentioning other potential buyers, we introduce a subtle sense of urgency.
* **Justification:** While we don't explicitly state why the product is worth $20,000 to Bob, the message implies its value. Bob will need to justify a counter-offer if he thinks the price is too high. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If we knew Bob was very price-sensitive, we might start with a slightly lower offer. However, starting high allows us to learn more about his negotiation style. 
* **Risk Tolerance:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. We're willing to take this risk because we have a guaranteed backup offer from John."
