Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Can you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get more for the product. While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to negotiate a higher amount. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9000}
