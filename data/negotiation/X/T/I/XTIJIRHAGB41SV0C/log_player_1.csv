"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Optimistic Tone:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and expressing confidence in a deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, indicating that I'm open to discussing the price.

**Strategy:** 

This opening offer sets the stage for a negotiation. By starting high, I aim to maximize my potential profit.  I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses, keeping in mind my floor price of $15,000 and the possibility of selling to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $15000 for it. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly my floor price. While I would ideally get more, accepting his offer guarantees me the minimum I'm willing to accept.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better outcome, and I risk losing time and potentially missing out on selling to John if I continue to negotiate."
