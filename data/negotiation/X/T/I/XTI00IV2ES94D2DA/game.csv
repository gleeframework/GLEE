"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $95? Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference -  how about $97.50? That would be a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $97.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92.50, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $95.  Let's close this deal at $95, and we'll both be happy.",95.0,Alice,7,
