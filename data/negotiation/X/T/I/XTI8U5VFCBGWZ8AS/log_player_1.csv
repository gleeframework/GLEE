I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,000,000 from John, giving me potential for a higher profit. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a chance Bob will reject the offer, the potential reward of earning $500,000 more outweighs the risk of settling for the minimum.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Starting high gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, potentially finding a price that's mutually beneficial.
* **Unknown Value:** I don't know the value of the product to Bob.  By starting high, I'm forcing him to reveal his own valuation. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
