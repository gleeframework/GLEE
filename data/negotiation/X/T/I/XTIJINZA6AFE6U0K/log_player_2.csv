"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a discount. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering $12,000. There's room for negotiation to save some money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has moved closer to your desired price point. Accepting her offer gets you the product for $11,500, saving you $3,500 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and driving the price up or having to settle with John's price is not worth the potential gain."
