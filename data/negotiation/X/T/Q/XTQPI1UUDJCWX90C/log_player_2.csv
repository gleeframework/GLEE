Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is still a significant amount above your ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. It shows you're serious about negotiating, but also leaves room for compromise.

Round 3

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
