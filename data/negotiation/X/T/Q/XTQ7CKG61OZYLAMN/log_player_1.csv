Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I would like to counteroffer at $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to drastically increase his offer beyond this point. Accepting his offer at $950,000 is a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,000,000. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
