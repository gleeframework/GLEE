"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $8500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9200, which is still a great deal for you. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9200 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go to $8750.  This is a fair price that's closer to our desired values. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $8750. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, which is my original offer. However, I'll throw in a small concession: I'll give you a 2% discount on the original price, so the price would be $8800. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,5,
