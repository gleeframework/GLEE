The product is worth $8,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $9,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9200, which is still a great deal for you. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

Alice's offer of $9,200 is still higher than the value of the product to me. I'm willing to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $8750. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, which is my original offer. However, I'll throw in a small concession: I'll give you a 2% discount on the original price, so the price would be $8800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $8,800 is close enough to my desired price of $8,000. While I'd prefer to pay less, this is a good deal considering my other option is to buy from John for $8,000."
