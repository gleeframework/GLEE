{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a chance to get a good price while still potentially closing a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my desired price. I'll sell to John to maximize my profit."
