"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price. How about $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that budget constraints can be a challenge. However, I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. My revised offer is $1250000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given the current situation, I think we can find a middle ground. How about considering $1100000 for the product?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1100000 is a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to see a more significant movement from your end. My revised offer is $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to consider. I'm starting to think that if we can't agree on this price, I might have to explore other opportunities.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
