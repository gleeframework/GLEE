""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you, and I'm offering it at a price of $9,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, $9,500 is a substantial profit over Alice's minimum of $8,000.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position, allowing her to confidently aim high with Bob."
