"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but my budget is quite limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to around $10000? I believe that would be a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $15000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Alice,3,
