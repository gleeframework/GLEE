"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? That would be a good starting point for us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000.  However, I'm still a bit over my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,750?  I'm confident this price would be fair for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,750 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,900. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $10,800? It's a fair compromise that would allow me to purchase the product while still staying within my budget.",10800.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,950. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",10950.0,Alice,7,
