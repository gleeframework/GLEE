# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than John's price, you can likely negotiate a better deal. There's room to haggle between Alice's valuation ($800,000) and your maximum price ($1,200,000)."
