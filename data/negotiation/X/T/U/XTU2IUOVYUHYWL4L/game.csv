"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $925,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This is a fair price, given the product's value and your willingness to negotiate. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
