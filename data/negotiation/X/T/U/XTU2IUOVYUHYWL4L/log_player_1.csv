Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth to him. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a bit higher."
