"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $800000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1000000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $1000000. However, I'm still not willing to meet you at that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $950000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for that $1000000 mark.  How about we split the difference at $975000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're still looking to spend closer to $1000000. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $975000. I'm willing to offer you a revised price of $975050. This is as close as I can get to your target price while still ensuring I get a good deal for the product. What do you think?",975050.0,Alice,5,
