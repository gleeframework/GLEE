{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $130. What do you think?"",

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:**  John acts as a safety net, guaranteeing you at least $100.

This strategy maximizes your potential earnings while still making the offer appealing to Bob."
