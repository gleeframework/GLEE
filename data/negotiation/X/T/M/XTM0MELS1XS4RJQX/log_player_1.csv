Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My starting offer is $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my goal of $10,000 if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
