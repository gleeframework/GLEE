"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My starting offer is $9,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is still higher than his ideal price but lower than Alice's offer. This signals his willingness to negotiate while also leaving room for further compromise. This approach aims to find a middle ground and hopefully close the deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,000, which is still above Bob's ideal price but within his budget. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product while saving $1,000 compared to buying from John. This is a good compromise considering the limited rounds and the potential for Alice to reject future counteroffers."
