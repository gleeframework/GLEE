"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Alice is offering it at that exact price. While it's a fair price for her, it doesn't give you any savings. Since you can get the same product from John for the same price, you're better off rejecting Alice's offer."
