"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,340,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If we can't agree on this, I'll need to consider other offers.",1340000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
