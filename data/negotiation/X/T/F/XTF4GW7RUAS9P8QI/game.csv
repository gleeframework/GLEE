"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $95 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm happy to pay $90 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit higher than your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $92. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this works for you.",92.0,Alice,5,
