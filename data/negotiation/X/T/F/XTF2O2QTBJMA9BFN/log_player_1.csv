Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal! What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $130 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **First Offer Advantage:**  By framing it as a ""special price,"" you create a sense of urgency and exclusivity for Bob. 

**If Bob rejects this offer, you can then decide whether to:**

* **Counteroffer:**  Lower the price slightly (e.g., to $120) to see if you can still make a profit above your minimum.
* **Move to John:** Accept John's offer of $150, ensuring your minimum profit."
