"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $160 is a bit high for me, but I'm interested.  Would you consider $130?  ",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! $130 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $145. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $140?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it right now.",140.0,Bob,4,
