"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000,  which reflects the fact that I am aiming for the best possible profit.
* It's a bold opening, aiming to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium. 
* I'll evaluate his response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* While $1,200,000 is my minimum value, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. Bob's offer is too low considering my initial offer and the value I place on the product. 
* I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise and meet me halfway. 
* By rejecting his offer, I can proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm lowering my price to $1,350,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. 
* I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive to Bob while still allowing me to profit from the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer remains at $1,200,000, which is my minimum. While I could continue to negotiate, I've already lowered my offer twice and haven't seen any willingness from Bob to compromise.
* With only 6 rounds left, the time pressure is increasing. 
* Selling to John guarantees me the minimum value and ensures I won't be left with the product at the end of the negotiation. 
*  It's a safer option than risking further rounds and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
