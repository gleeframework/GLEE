"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we settle on $10,500? This price still allows me some profit while making the product more accessible to you. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,200. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",10200.0,Bob,4,
