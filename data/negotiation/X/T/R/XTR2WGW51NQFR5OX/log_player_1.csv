Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept from John, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a deal closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my desired value, it's still below what I would get from John. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm offering a price of $1,600,000. This is still higher than what Bob offered, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to get closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's latest offer is below my minimum acceptable price, and it's unlikely he'll offer any better.  John is offering my minimum, so it's best to secure the deal with John."
