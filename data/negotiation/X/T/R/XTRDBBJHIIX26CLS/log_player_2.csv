"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

Let's start by offering a price that's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still a reasonable starting point for negotiation. We'll see if she's willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down in price, and $950,000 is a good deal.  There's always a risk that we could get a better price, but it's unlikely we'll get much lower.  Accepting this offer saves us $250,000 compared to buying from John."
