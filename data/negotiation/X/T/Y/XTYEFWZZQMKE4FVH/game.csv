"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive for me. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I appreciate your perspective,  $18,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you meet me closer to $20,000 and we might be able to make a deal?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $20,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $19,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you mentioned earlier.",19000.0,Bob,4,
