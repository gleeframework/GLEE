"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I'm confident this product will be worth it for you.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $105 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110, so I'll offer $107.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",107.5,Bob,6,
