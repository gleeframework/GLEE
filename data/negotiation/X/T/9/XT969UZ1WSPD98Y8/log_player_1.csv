Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't immediately lose out.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair"" price to encourage Bob to consider it without feeling pressured. I also acknowledge that he has a different perspective on value, which allows for a more open negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize potential profit:**  By starting with a higher price, I have more room to negotiate and potentially reach a higher final price.
* **Maintain leverage:** While I'm willing to negotiate, my starting price makes it clear that I'm not desperate to sell to Bob.
* **Consider John's offer:** I'm aware of John's $1,500,000 offer, which gives me a safety net and the flexibility to walk away if Bob becomes unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Selling to Bob at that price would mean a significant loss for me. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Value:** I need to prioritize my own value for the product. Accepting Bob's offer would be a significant financial compromise.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage in the negotiation. It shows that I am not desperate to sell and am willing to walk away if I don't get a better price.
* **Exploring Potential Counteroffers:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and explore if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. It acknowledges Bob's budget constraints while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the value of the product while highlighting that this is a final offer. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Price:**  $1,000,000 is a significant compromise for me, but it leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob is willing to raise his offer slightly.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintaining Leverage:** By presenting this as a final offer, I put the pressure on Bob to either accept or walk away. 
* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer attempts to bridge the gap between our positions, increasing the chances of a successful deal. 
* **Considering Alternatives:** While I am willing to compromise, I am also aware that I can walk away and get $1,500,000 from John.  This gives me a safety net and motivates Bob to potentially increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  Given that I can get $1,500,000 from John, it makes more sense to walk away from the negotiation with Bob.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me the highest possible return.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Negotiating with Bob further carries the risk of him rejecting my counteroffers, leaving me with nothing.
* **Time Constraint:** While I could continue negotiating, it's likely Bob is set on his price.  Selling to John allows me to secure the deal quickly and avoid further delays.

**Conclusion:**  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed offer from John."
