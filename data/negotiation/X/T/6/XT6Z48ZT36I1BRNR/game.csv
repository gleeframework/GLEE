"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. That's still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $97 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $101? It's a fair compromise and would allow us both to get a good deal.",101.0,Alice,5,
