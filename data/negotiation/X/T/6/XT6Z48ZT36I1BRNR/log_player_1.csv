# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $90 is too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price, even if it takes a few more rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. That's still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $97 is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still confident I can get a bit more. I'll see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $97 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $101? It's a fair compromise and would allow us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 101}
