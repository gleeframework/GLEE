Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something you're interested in, and I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly might be preferable to waiting for John's guaranteed $12,000, even if the final price is slightly lower."
