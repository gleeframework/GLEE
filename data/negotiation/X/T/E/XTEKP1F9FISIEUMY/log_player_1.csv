"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $650,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $750,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves you with a good value for the product."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down. I'm getting closer, but $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? That feels like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While selling to John for $1,000,000 would be the ideal outcome, Bob's offer of $700,000 is still a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation. It's a good compromise."
