"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal for something worth so much to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $650,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  By offering $650,000, we're signaling that we're serious but also open to meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Polite and Professional:** The tone remains friendly and respectful throughout the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $750,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves you with a good value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress is being made:** Alice is coming down from her initial offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still room for improvement:** $750,000 is closer to our target, but it's still more expensive than buying from John. We can push a little further. 
* **Maintaining a balance:** We want to show Alice we're serious while still aiming for a price that works for us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down. I'm getting closer, but $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** By suggesting $700,000, we're proposing a compromise that splits the difference between her current offer and our previous counteroffer. 
* **Conveying firmness:** While remaining polite, we're signaling that we have a limit in mind and are getting closer to potentially walking away.
* **Maintaining a sense of urgency:** We don't want to drag out the negotiation too long and risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice if she becomes impatient."
