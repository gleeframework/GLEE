Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive chance to purchase this product.  I think you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's perceived value ($8,000) leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  By calling it an ""exclusive chance"" there's a subtle implication that the offer won't last forever, potentially pushing Bob to act."
