"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $14,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  There's room for negotiation as Alice is willing to sell for $12,000, and Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000."

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $14,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $14,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000.  Bob has already counteroffered twice, and further negotiation might risk Alice getting frustrated and sticking to her $14,000 offer.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible option to get the product at a good price."
