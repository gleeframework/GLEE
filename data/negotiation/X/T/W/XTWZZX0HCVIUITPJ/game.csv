"Alice,  $2000000 is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $1200000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1800000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1200000.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept it.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $1200000, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1600000. It's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1600000.  However, I'm still only able to offer $1400000.  This is a fair price considering we are both trying to find a compromise.  I am very interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell at $1400000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer a price of $1550000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down further.  However, I am still only able to offer $1500000.   I'm sure you understand that this is the highest I can go.  I hope you will reconsider and accept my final offer.",1500000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell at $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1550000 and $1500000, which is $1525000. It's the last compromise I'm willing to make. What do you think?",1525000.0,Alice,9,
