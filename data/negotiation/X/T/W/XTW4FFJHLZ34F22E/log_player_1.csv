Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:** The offer needs to be significantly higher than John's $800,000 to incentivize Bob while still securing a substantial profit.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
