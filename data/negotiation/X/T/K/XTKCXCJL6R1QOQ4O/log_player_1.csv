{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset. To start, I'm offering it for $1,000,000. This price reflects its worth while leaving room for negotiation. Let's make this a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value and leaves us both with a gain. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. It's important to remember my minimum price is $800,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $700,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  To bridge the gap and ensure a mutually beneficial outcome, I'm willing to lower my price to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and it still allows me to meet my minimum requirement. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This seems like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while working for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
