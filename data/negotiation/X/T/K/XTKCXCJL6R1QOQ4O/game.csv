"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset. To start, I'm offering it for $1,000,000. This price reflects its worth while leaving room for negotiation. Let's make this a mutually beneficial deal.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value and leaves us both with a gain.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $700,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  To bridge the gap and ensure a mutually beneficial outcome, I'm willing to lower my price to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and it still allows me to meet my minimum requirement. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This seems like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while working for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
