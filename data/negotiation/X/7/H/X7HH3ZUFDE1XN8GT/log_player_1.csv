Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $1,100,000. I believe this product will be highly valuable to you, and this offer reflects a fair price within the range of its worth."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing on a price higher than $1,000,000.
* **Avoid a Lowball:** Offering a price too close to your minimum ($800,000) might make Bob think the product is worth less or discourage him from negotiating.

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, you'll sell to John and there's no chance to get a higher price from Bob."
