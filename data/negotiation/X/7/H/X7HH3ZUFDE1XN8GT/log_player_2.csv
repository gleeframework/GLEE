# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $1,100,000. I believe this product will be highly valuable to you, and this offer reflects a fair price within the range of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
 
While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is under your $1,200,000 limit, there's room for negotiation. You know you have John as a backup option at $1,200,000, so you can try to get a better price from Alice."
