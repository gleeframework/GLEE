Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm offering the product to you for $630,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.

Alice is clearly trying to get as close to $650,000 as possible.  At this point, the difference between continuing to negotiate and her offer is getting smaller.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and risking getting a worse deal isn't worth the potential savings."
