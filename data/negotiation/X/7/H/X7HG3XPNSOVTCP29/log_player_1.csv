{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially reach a price closer to my desired $12,000. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I'm aware that John is a backup option, giving me leverage in negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll observe Bob's response and adapt my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll either make a counteroffer or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting it would be a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I still have the option of selling to John for $12,000, giving me strong leverage in this negotiation. 
* **Counteroffer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $10,000. If he rejects, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($8,500). This shows a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob, emphasizing that even at $9,500, it's a good deal.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm not going below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm still ready to sell to John if Bob rejects this offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response and decide whether to accept his counteroffer or make another counteroffer. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $9,000. Could you meet me in the middle at $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $9,250 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $9,500.  It's a good compromise.
* **Potential for Future Deal:**  By accepting, I create a positive relationship with Bob, potentially leading to future deals.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While selling to John for $12,000 would be ideal, accepting Bob's offer still yields a decent profit and minimizes the risk of a prolonged negotiation that could lead to a stalemate.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll finalize the sale with Bob and focus on maximizing the profit from this transaction.  I'll also consider building a long-term relationship with Bob for potential future opportunities."
