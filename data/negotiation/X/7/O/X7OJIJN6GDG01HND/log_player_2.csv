Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value. However,  $1,200,000 falls significantly short of what I believe to be a fair reflection of its potential.  To move forward, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This represents a substantial adjustment on my end while still acknowledging the true value of this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.
