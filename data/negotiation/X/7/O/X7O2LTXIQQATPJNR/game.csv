"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering a product that I believe could be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand you may not know the full potential of this, but I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000, a price that reflects its potential and the fact that I'm confident you'll see its value. If you're interested, let's discuss further. If not, I have another buyer lined up who's ready to pay $1000000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
