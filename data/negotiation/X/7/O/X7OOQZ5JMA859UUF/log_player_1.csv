Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a higher price from Bob. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a chance to walk away with a good profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $975,000, which is a good compromise and a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $975,000 is a good price and significantly better than selling to John.  It's also a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us."
