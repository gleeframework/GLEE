I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  I'll be watching Bob's reaction and adjusting my strategy from there."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's my minimum, I think I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal than Bob's initial offer."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  It's still higher than what John is offering, and I'm confident that I won't be able to get a better price from Bob.  It's time to finalize the deal!"
