"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and still leaves you room for profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, I can still potentially get closer to my desired price. I'm going to try and push for a higher amount in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to $13,500 to make this worthwhile. This would still represent a significant saving for you compared to your initial estimate, and leaves me some room to negotiate further. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $13,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $13,000 is a significant improvement over his previous offer. It's also getting closer to the price John is willing to pay. It's risky to keep pushing, as Bob might walk away entirely, and I don't want to risk losing out on this opportunity."
