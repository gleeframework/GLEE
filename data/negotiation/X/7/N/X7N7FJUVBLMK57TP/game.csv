"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and still leaves you room for profit. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to $13,500 to make this worthwhile. This would still represent a significant saving for you compared to your initial estimate, and leaves me some room to negotiate further. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $13,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price",13000.0,Bob,4,
