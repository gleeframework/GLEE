Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've started with a price of $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value Bob will get from the product to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The price is not my absolute bottom line, allowing for potential counteroffers and negotiation. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm always aware of the $15,000 offer from John, which gives me confidence to walk away if the negotiations with Bob don't reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to his perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, I want to see if I can push Bob a bit higher before accepting.  I'll counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I've countered with $10,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I frame the price as ""fair"" to create a sense of mutual benefit. 
* **Keep John in Mind:**  I'm still aware of John's $15,000 offer, so I'm not willing to drop my price too low.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than the $15,000 I could get from John. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target. 

I'm going to make another counteroffer, hoping to secure a price that's more in line with the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer.  While $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like,  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and indicating my willingness to be flexible by coming down from $10,500 to $10,000. 
* **Compromise and Fairness:**  I'm framing the $10,000 price as a ""fair compromise"" to emphasize that we're both making concessions.
* **Close the Gap:**  This counteroffer further reduces the gap between our desired prices and increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement. 
* **Continue to Negotiate:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a backup option, but I'm committed to seeing if we can secure a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and we're almost there. How about we meet in the middle at $9750? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,750 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I've already made several concessions, and I'm confident that I can secure a much better deal with John. 

Given the risk of further negotiation with Bob not yielding a more favorable outcome, I'm choosing to sell to John for $15,000. This ensures I maximize my profit and achieve my financial goal."
