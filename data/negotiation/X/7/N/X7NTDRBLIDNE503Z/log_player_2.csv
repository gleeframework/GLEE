While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product right now, I can tell you that it's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1750000. This price reflects the potential value of this product and the opportunity for us to establish a mutually beneficial relationship. Let me know your thoughts, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's better to reject the offer and purchase from John for a much lower price."
