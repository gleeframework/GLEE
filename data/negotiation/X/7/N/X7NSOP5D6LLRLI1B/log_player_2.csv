"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15000 for it. It's a fair price considering its worth, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth exploring negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is my maximum.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which still reflects the value of the product. I believe this price is fair, and I hope we can reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $12,000 is still too high for my budget.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and get a better price, as I'm still within my 10 rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9500 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which I believe is a fair compromise. It's a significant reduction from my previous offer and a good value for you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
