"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's worth considering.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,100,000? This would be a good middle ground, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
