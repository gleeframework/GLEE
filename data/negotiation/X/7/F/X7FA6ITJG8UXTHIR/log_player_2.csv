It's always a good idea to try to negotiate, especially when you have a backup option.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1050000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is a decent compromise, and it's still a significant savings compared to buying from John. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation."
