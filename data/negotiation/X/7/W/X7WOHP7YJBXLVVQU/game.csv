"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is too low for me. I'm prepared to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $850,000? That leaves some room for both of us to be happy.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still above my limit. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'll offer $800,000.  This is my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
