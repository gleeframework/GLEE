"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which I think is a fair reflection of its value. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the compromise, but I still believe that $8,000 is a reasonable price for the product. I would like to stick to my original offer.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I am unable to increase my offer beyond $8,000. I hope we can find a way to reach an agreement that respects both our positions.",8000.0,Bob,6,
