"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product for less than it's worth to you, and I get a good price. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is a bit high. There's room for negotiation, and I might be able to get it for a price closer to $9,000.  I'll see if she's willing to come down."
