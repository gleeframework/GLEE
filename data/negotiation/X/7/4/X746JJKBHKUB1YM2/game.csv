"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. Would you like to make a purchase?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $110? I'm really interested in the product and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. Would you be willing to accept that price?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $130 is still a little more than I can afford right now. How about we split the difference and go with $125? That seems like a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider $125, but I was thinking more along the lines of $135. It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
