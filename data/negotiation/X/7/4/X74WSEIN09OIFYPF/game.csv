"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,100,000 is a bit below my target, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  How about $1,150,000? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
