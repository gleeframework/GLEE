"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see if Bob is seriously interested in buying. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value ($1,000,000) as possible, but I'm also prepared to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can do better. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, while still remaining above my minimum value. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise point, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,050,000. This is a significant drop, but I'm getting closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to accept, as we're only $50,000 apart now. If he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time I'm accepting Bob's offer.  We're only $20,000 apart and with only 4 rounds left I don't want to risk losing the deal to John."
