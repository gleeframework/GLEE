Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given the potential of the product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $900,000 is closer, but I believe a price of $875,000 would be more equitable for both of us. This reflects the potential of the product while also allowing for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.
