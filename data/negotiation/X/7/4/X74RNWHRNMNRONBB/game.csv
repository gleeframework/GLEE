"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given the potential of the product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to be a bit flexible, but $850,000 is a significant drop.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $900,000 is closer, but I believe a price of $875,000 would be more equitable for both of us. This reflects the potential of the product while also allowing for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your persistence tells me you see the value in this product. Let's try to wrap this up. How about $885,000?  This is my final offer.",885000.0,Alice,5,
