"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I can see the value of the product is worth more to you than that. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground.  To be transparent, I'm very close to pursuing another option at a lower price point.  If you're able to come down to $950,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're close to exploring other options, and I don't want to lose the deal. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Let's try $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
