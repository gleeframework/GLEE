"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is far too low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1500000. Let's meet halfway.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
