"Alice, your product looks great, but $1,150,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and my available funds. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident in the value this product brings, and I believe it's worth closer to my initial asking price. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that we can both agree on.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
