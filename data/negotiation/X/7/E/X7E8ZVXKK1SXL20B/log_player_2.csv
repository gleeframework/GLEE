# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially securing a lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident in the value this product brings, and I believe it's worth closer to my initial asking price. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice is also willing to compromise a little more, and I'm not yet ready to walk away and pay John's price."
