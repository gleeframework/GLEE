"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  Would you be interested in paying $9,500 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is quite high. While you're willing to pay up to $10,000, you know John will sell it for that price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or simply proceed to buy from John and save $500."
