Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer lets me see how interested Bob is and if he's willing to pay close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I have room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I have a guaranteed $100 offer from John, so I can afford to be a bit more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's offer.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is still a good deal even at $95.
* **Flexibility:** I'm signaling that I'm open to further discussion and willing to be flexible. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still ensuring I receive a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. How about we meet at $92? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I reject his offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I'd have to sell to John for $100, which is less than what Bob is offering.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing the negotiation could take more time and effort without guaranteeing a better outcome. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that's almost as good as selling to John, while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
