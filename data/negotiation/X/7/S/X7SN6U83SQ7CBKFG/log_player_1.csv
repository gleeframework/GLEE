I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This gives Bob room to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a decent return. If Bob rejects this, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, keeping in mind my floor price of $1,500,000 and John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, his offer is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price and John's guaranteed offer. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."

I'm reducing my offer to $1,750,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but shows a willingness to compromise. I hope this encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price while still being a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is unwilling to budge on his offer.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, his persistence in offering such a low price indicates he doesn't value the product enough to reach a mutually agreeable number. Selling to John guarantees me a safe and acceptable profit, which is preferable to risking further negotiation with Bob."
