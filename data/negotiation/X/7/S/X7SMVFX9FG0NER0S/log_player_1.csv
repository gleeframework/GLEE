Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can always come down a bit while still staying above your minimum.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  A price slightly below a round number like $20,000 can make it seem more appealing. 

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, it's generally best to aim for the highest reasonable price with Bob first."
