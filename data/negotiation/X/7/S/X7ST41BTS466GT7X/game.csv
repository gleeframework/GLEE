"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. Considering the value it holds for me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both our perspectives.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $10,000. It's a significant step towards finding a middle ground, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. Considering the value it holds for me is $15,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both our perspectives and allows me to recoup some of the value I've invested in the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a substantial amount closer to your last offer and a fair compromise for both of us.  This gives you a good profit margin, and I get a great deal on a valuable product.  Let's close this deal!",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll offer it to you for $10,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both our perspectives and allows me to recoup some of the value I've invested in the product.",10000.0,Alice,7,
