Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price of $175, knowing that the product is worth $150 to Bob. This gives him some room to negotiate without me losing out on my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm counter-offering with $165, which is still a fair price for Bob considering his initial willingness to pay $150. This keeps the negotiation moving while still allowing for potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $155 is now higher than John's offer of $150. This means I can secure a better price for the product by accepting Bob's offer."
