"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her actual value for the product, it's still higher than my maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is still above my budget. It's tempting to accept because it's closer to my limit, but I can try to negotiate further. I'm still confident I can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,150,000 is still above my budget. While I'm close to accepting it, I've already made multiple counteroffers and it's unlikely Alice will budge further.  Since John is willing to sell the product for my maximum budget, it's better to buy from him and avoid further negotiation."
