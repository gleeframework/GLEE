"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a respectable offer, the value of this product to the right buyer is far greater. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects a balance between its true worth and your interest in acquiring it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your perspective on the product's value.  However, $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product. This offer is a significant step closer to your previous proposal, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I acknowledge your commitment to this deal. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $975,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of this product.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $975,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit above my comfortable range. I'm going to offer $950,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that respects both of our positions.",950000.0,Bob,6,
