"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you say?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $140. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $140.  It's a good deal, but I'm still a little high.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $120?  That's my final offer.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $120, which would be $130. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
