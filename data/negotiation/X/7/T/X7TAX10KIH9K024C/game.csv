"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and I think we can both be happy with that price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is my best offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $9,250? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $9,100, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",9100.0,Bob,6,
