"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,250.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.  What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,5,
