"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I am interested in purchasing the item, but my budget is limited. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can see the value of this item is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're convinced about the market value, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $11500, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,5,
