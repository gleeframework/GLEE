"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum value. This is a strategic move to signal that you're serious about buying the product but also aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for you.  While you might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of further negotiation is that Alice might walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product for a price significantly lower than John's while still leaving some profit for Alice."
