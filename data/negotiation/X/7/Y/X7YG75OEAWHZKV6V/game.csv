,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000.

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still a bit higher than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $11,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,5,
