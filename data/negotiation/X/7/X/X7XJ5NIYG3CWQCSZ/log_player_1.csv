Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum value.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point,  I've gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and while I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price,  $920,000 is still a good deal.  I'm accepting Bob's offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection, which could lead me to sell to John for less than what I'm currently being offered."
