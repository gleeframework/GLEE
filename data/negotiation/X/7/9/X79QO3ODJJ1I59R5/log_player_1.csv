Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA)"":**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.  Here's an approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its long-term benefits."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Opening:** Starting at $1,450,000 gives you room to negotiate down while staying above your minimum.
* **Justification:** Vaguely mentioning ""unique value"" and ""long-term benefits"" attempts to justify the high price without revealing specifics about John's offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone implies willingness to negotiate. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:**  How Bob responds will determine your next move. Be prepared to counter-offer or walk away if he's not willing to meet you close to your desired price.
* **Alternative Buyers:** Having John as a backup strengthens your position. It allows you to be more confident in your negotiation with Bob."
