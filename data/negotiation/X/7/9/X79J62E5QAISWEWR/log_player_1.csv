Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,250,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly lower than your asking price but still allows you to profit.
