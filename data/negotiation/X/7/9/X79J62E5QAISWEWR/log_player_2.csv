"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is a step closer to Bob's goal, it's still above his maximum budget. Bob can try to negotiate a lower price again by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'd like to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part and allows you to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a budget of $1,200,000.  Alice's final offer is $1,325,000, which is above Bob's budget.  While Bob has been able to negotiate a lower price, he's already reached a point where it's more financially beneficial to purchase from John for the agreed upon $1,200,000.  This saves Bob $125,000 compared to Alice's offer."
