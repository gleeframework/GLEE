Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price considering your own value for the product and my need to stay within my limits.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
