"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. I think this is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below Bob's maximum, it's still above Alice's minimum.  There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price considering your own value for the product and my need to stay within my limits.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget.**  Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering the product for $11,000.
* **Continuing negotiation could lead to a lower price, but it's risky.** There's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and Bob could end up paying more than $11,000 if the negotiations drag on.  
* **Buying from John is more expensive.** John is selling the product for $12,000, making Alice's offer a better deal.

It's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and save $1,000 compared to buying from John."
