"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price considering your own value for the product and my need to stay within my limits.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
