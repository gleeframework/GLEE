"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, as I want to ensure it's a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. I'm confident this price reflects the product's value while allowing me to make a profitable purchase.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point acknowledges the true worth of what's being offered while still leaving room for a favorable outcome on your end.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This price is fair and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  I'm confident this will be a good deal for you, as you'll still be selling the product for more than your personal valuation.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
