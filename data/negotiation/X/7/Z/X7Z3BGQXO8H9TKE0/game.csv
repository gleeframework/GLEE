,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a way to make this work for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob! However, I've already told you that my minimum price is $150. I can do a bit better than that, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm willing to make a deal with you at that price.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to pay $115 right now. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really serious about getting this product, Bob! I'm willing to compromise further, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $125, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",125.0,Alice,5,
