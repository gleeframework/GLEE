"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you is $800,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $650,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $750,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and the product's worth to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $700,000 is still a bit below my minimum threshold. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you at $725,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and the product's worth to you. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $712,500?  This seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",712500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, $712,500 is still a bit below my minimum. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you at $720,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and the product's worth to you. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal.",720000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob. However, I still need to get a bit closer to my target price. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you at $725,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and the product's worth to you. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal.",725000.0,Alice,9,
