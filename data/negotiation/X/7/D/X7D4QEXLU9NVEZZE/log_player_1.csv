Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John provides a safety net at $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob allows us to maximize potential profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,300,000 is still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000), making it a very attractive offer. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to accept quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price attractive to Bob and one that yields a substantial profit for Alice."
