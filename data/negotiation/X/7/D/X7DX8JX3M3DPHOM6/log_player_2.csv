It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to see if you can get a better deal."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a lower price.  This should give Alice a chance to consider a lower offer, while still being within my budget."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice has come down from her initial price, and $850,000 is a good price. Buying from John would be significantly more expensive, so accepting Alice's offer is the best option."
