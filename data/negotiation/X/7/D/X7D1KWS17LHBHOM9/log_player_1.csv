"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,400,000. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob, setting a cooperative tone. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,400,000 offer is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price, giving me space to make concessions.
* **Strategic First Move:**  By making the first offer, I establish a baseline for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and also below my initial offer of $1,400,000.  
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation alive. This allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome, there's still potential to close a deal with Bob at a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,000,000 is significantly below my expectations, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.  My counteroffer is $1,250,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $1,250,000 is halfway between my initial offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,000,000.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message highlights the value of the product to reinforce my position.
* **Mutually Beneficial:** I frame the counteroffer as a way to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, further encouraging cooperation. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** This counteroffer gives Bob a clearer understanding of my desired price range and provides an opportunity for a quick resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That price is getting closer, but it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to cave in too quickly.  Rejecting his offer keeps pressure on him and gives me the opportunity to counter with a higher price.
* **The Risk of John:** I'm aware of the potential of selling to John, but I still believe there's room to negotiate a better price with Bob.
* **Strategic Play:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell at a discounted price. This can make him more willing to increase his offer in future rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and understand that we're getting closer.  While $1,125,000 is still a bit below my expectations, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  My counteroffer is $1,200,000.  This reflects the product's value and shows my commitment to reaching a deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** My counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a smaller concession than the previous round, demonstrating that I'm not willing to give away too much more.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I again emphasize the value of the product to justify my price point.
* **Commitment to Deal:** I reiterate my commitment to reaching a deal, encouraging Bob to consider my offer seriously.
* **Strategic Play:**  By meeting him halfway, I'm hoping to signal that I'm flexible but also that I'm not going to significantly lower my price. 
* **Negotiation Dance:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while still putting pressure on Bob to make a move."
