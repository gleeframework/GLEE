Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable to me, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference again and settle at $800,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.
