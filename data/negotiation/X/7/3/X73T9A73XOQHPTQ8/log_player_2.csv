Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good value considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice is unlikely to go below $900,000, and you have a guaranteed offer for $800,000 from John. There's no point in risking further negotiation when you have a sure thing that meets your budget."
