"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable to me, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference again and settle at $800,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good value considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",900000.0,Alice,5,
