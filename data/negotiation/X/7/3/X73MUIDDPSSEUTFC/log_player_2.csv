{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down, or you can always switch to John's offer if the negotiation fails."

{""product_price"": 750000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $900,000, which is closer to Alice's last offer but still within my budget. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but am not willing to pay a price significantly higher than my maximum. This should encourage Alice to come down further."

Alice's latest offer is closer to my budget, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  Increasing my counteroffer to $950,000 shows I'm willing to compromise but am still trying to negotiate a good deal. This should further pressure Alice to consider a lower price."
