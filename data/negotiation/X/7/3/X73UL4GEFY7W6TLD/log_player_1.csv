Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. I believe this price is still fair, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer him in the next round.  While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000.  This price still gives you a significant advantage, and it allows me to reach a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $1,250,000 is tempting, I'm still confident that I can get a higher price.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, but $1,300,000 is my absolute final offer.
