Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $11,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $10,000 rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
