Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Strong but Fair:** The message positions the price as fair, highlighting the product's value to Bob. This makes it more likely for Bob to accept without further negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy maximizes the potential profit while still having a fallback option with John."
