"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $9,000. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $7,800 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $7,800 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,100. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen.",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $7,900 for the product. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",7900.0,Bob,6,
