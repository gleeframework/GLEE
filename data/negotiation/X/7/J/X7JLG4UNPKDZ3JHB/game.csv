"I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,050,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a lower offer. How about $1,050,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from the initial offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $1,075,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,025,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to me.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
