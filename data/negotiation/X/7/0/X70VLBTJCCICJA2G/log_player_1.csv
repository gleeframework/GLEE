Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, we start significantly higher to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing our bottom line, making it seem like a considered price rather than an arbitrary number.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, we create a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a deal above Bob's valuation:** Ideally, Bob sees the potential value and accepts our offer, even if it's a bit above his initial valuation. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, we have space to negotiate down while still staying above our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Maintain John as a safety net:** If Bob rejects our offer, we haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at our desired price."
