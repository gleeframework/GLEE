"Alice, I appreciate your offer.  However, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Would you be willing to consider $750000? I believe this is a fair price, given my budget and the value of the product.  Let me know what you think!",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still confident in the value of this product.  It's truly special, and I believe it can deliver significant returns for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $850000? This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $800000. This is a significant price reduction from your initial offer, and I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset to me. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
