Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $13,500. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $13,500 is a strong starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Creating Urgency:** By implying you have other buyers (John), you create a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible, starting with a slight buffer allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still staying above your minimum."
