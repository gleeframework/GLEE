"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price for you, as you've indicated its worth $1,200,000 to you. While I have other potential buyers who are willing to pay $1,500,000, I value our potential partnership and believe this offer provides a mutually beneficial outcome.  Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for his maximum price, ensuring the best possible outcome for Bob."
