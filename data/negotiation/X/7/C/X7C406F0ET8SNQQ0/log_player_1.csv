**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly entrenched below $120 and is unlikely to move significantly. While we could continue negotiating, it's becoming increasingly risky.  We are now only $8 above John's offer. Accepting a lower offer from Bob at this point isn't worth potentially losing out on a guaranteed $100 from John."
