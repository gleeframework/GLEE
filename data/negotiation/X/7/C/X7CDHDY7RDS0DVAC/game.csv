"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, say around $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $112?",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $112, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $115. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",115.0,Alice,5,
