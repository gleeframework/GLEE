Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John at $12,000. This approach prioritizes a potentially higher profit without risking a no-sale situation."
