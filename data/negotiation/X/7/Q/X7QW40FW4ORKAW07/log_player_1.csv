Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Strategic markup:** A price of $1,450,000 represents a roughly 20% markup. This is significant but not outrageous, making it more likely Bob will consider it.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests you're open to discussing the price, which can encourage Bob to engage even if he initially balks at the initial offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit. If you were aiming for a quick sale or wanted to ensure Bob specifically gets the product, a lower initial offer would be more appropriate."
