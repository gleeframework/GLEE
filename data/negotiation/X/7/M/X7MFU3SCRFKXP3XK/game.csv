"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  It's a unique item with immense potential, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's inherent worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $1,300,000 is beyond my current budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this offers a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
