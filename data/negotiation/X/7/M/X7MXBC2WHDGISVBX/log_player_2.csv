# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. Considering the product's unique features and value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $950,000 to $875,000. This is a significant reduction, and you're still saving a considerable amount compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer at $875,000 is a good deal for you, as it allows you to acquire the product for a reasonable price."
