"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1300000. This is still a great deal, considering its worth to me is at least $1200000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  I'm still a bit higher than my target.  How about we split the difference and go with $1200000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer, and I appreciate your commitment to finding a fair price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1220000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering its worth to me is at least $1200000.
