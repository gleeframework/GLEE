"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to me is at least $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:**  Starting with a lower offer sets a clear expectation of negotiation and puts pressure on Alice to compromise.
* **Realistic Value:**  $1,100,000 is within your budget and still potentially profitable for Alice, especially if the product is worth $1,200,000 to her.
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and respectful tone can help keep the negotiation productive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1300000. This is still a great deal, considering its worth to me is at least $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your target price, but closer. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring if you can get even lower. You have more rounds available, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer keeps the bargaining going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  I'm still a bit higher than my target.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,200,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** This counteroffer is at your maximum budget, setting a clear and final line in the sand. 
* **Compromise Language:** Emphasizing splitting the difference reinforces the idea of a fair deal for both parties. 
* **Directness:**  This counteroffer is straightforward and shows you're ready to close the deal at your limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your target price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product to you for $1250000. This is a very competitive price, considering its worth to me is at least $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can secure the product at your desired price. You still have several rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility.  I'm going to stick to my original offer of $1,200,000.  It's my absolute maximum, but I think it's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:** This counteroffer is a clear signal that you're serious about this price and won't go higher. 
* **Reinforce Value:**  Reminding Alice of the product's value strengthens your position and justifies your offer.
* **Call to Action:**  The closing statement encourages Alice to accept and finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer, and I appreciate your commitment to finding a fair price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1220000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering its worth to me is at least $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting very close to your target price, you've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like she's reluctant to go lower.  With only a few rounds remaining, the risk of continuing the negotiation is high.  It's better to secure the product from John at your maximum budget and avoid potential further delays or a worse outcome."
