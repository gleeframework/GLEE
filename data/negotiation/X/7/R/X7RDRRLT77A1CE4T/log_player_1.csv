"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $20,000.  This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's value to me. It's important to see how Bob reacts before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $16,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly below my minimum.  I'll counter and see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer but still staying above my minimum. $18,000 is a good middle ground, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. It's time to secure the deal. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and a profit, which is more important than trying to squeeze out a few extra dollars and risk losing the sale altogether."
