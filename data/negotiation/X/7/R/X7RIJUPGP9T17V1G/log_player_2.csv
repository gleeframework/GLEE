"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower since the product is worth significantly less to her ($800,000). Rejecting her initial offer might prompt a better counter-offer."
