"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $850,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This is a fair price considering your own valuation of the product, and it would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",825000.0,Alice,5,
