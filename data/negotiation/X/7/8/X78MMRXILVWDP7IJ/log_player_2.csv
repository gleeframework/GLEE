"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find great value in it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $2,000,000 is way over Bob's budget of $1,500,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  While I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly over my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for your product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1200000 is far below the value of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a significant discount from her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. There's still room for negotiation, and he should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000 for your product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm seeking. Let's meet in the middle to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $1400000 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1550000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial partnership. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice has come down in price, it's still a bit over Bob's budget and the negotiation could continue indefinitely. At this point, it's best for Bob to lock in the guaranteed price of $1,500,000 from John to avoid the risk of further price increases."
