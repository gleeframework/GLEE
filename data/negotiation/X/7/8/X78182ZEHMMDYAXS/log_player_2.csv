"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you. I've done my research and understand its value to you is $1,500,000. However, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

* **You're saving money.**  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John."
