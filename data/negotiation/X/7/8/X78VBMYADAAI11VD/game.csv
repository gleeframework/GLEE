"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $8,200 for it, which is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,000. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $8,500. This is a good price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. I hope we can agree on this.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $8,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $8,750. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8750.0,Alice,5,
