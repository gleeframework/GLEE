Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."", ""product_price"": 925000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $925,000 allows for some negotiation if Bob counter-offers. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision faster.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John if Bob rejects the offer.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining a significant margin above your minimum acceptable price."
