Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $120, you're setting a high anchor point. Even if Bob doesn't accept this price, it might make him view subsequent offers as more reasonable. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $80 to Bob.  While starting high is a good strategy,  being too aggressive could make Bob walk away.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer of $80 from John. Keep this in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both your minimum price ($80) and his own valuation of the product. Accepting this would be a substantial loss. It's clear there's room for negotiation, so moving to the next round with a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $60 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** We've made a substantial concession from $120 to $100, signaling our willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Valuation:**  We're still aiming for a price above both our minimum and Bob's valuation, leaving space for further negotiation if needed.
* **""Meeting in the middle"" Framing:** This tactic can be psychologically effective, making the offer seem more reasonable and appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to save a bit more. How about we meet at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $90 is above your minimum acceptable price of $80, securing you a profit.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to Bob walking away or a stalemate. Accepting now avoids that risk.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While you could potentially squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob, the time and effort involved might not be worth it, especially considering John's standing offer of $80."
