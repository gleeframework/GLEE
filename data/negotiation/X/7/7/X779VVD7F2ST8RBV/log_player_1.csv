Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This gives him a good deal as it's still $10 less than what the product is worth to him.  It also leaves me with a profit of $40, which is significantly more than the $0 I'd get from selling it to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $135. It's a compromise between his offer and my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than selling to John,  I still believe I can get a higher price. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to reach a compromise with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $125. It's a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is too low for me.  While I could continue to counteroffer, it's unlikely he'll budge much further. It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $100 than to risk getting nothing."
