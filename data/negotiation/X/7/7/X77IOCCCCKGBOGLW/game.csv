"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $18,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $16,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
