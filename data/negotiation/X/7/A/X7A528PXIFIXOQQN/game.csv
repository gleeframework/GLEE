"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in your product, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, and I understand your budget concerns.  While $8,500 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant discount and still allows me to make a fair profit. Let's find a way to make this work!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm going to stick with $9,000.  It's a fair price for a product you value at $10,000, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let's finalize this deal!",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your stance, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,800, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  Let's make this happen.  It's a great price for both of us.",8800.0,Bob,6,
