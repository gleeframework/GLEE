Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in your product, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $8,500 is still a bit low for me, but I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, and I understand your budget concerns.  While $8,500 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant discount and still allows me to make a fair profit. Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,750 is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a slightly better deal with Bob. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm going to stick with $9,000.  It's a fair price for a product you value at $10,000, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your stance, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,800, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  Let's make this happen.  It's a great price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $8,800 is closer to my desired price, we're running out of rounds.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  It's not the ideal outcome, but it's better than potentially losing out on a sale altogether."
