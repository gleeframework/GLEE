Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, hoping to get a good price. But I'm also aware that Bob might not be willing to pay that much, so I'm prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$120 is too low for me. I'm going to try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price.  $140 is a fair compromise, and I think it's still a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offers are getting lower, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a higher price. I'm also worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, he might get frustrated and walk away.  It's better to sell to John and get a guaranteed $150."
