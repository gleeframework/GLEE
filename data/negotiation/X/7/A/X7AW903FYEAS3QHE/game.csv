"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it right now. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can agree on this.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $115. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go down to $125.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,6,
