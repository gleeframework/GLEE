"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product at a price of $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, reflecting the product's worth to me. 
* **Open Communication:** I'm emphasizing the value and uniqueness of the product to encourage Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I want to maximize my profit, I'm leaving room for negotiation, anticipating Bob might counteroffer. 
* **Considering John:**  Knowing John's offer of $1,000,000, this price leaves me a significant margin for profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  While I could sell to John for $1,000,000, I still have 9 rounds left to try and get a better price from Bob.
* **Counteroffering Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a more favorable price. 

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet halfway at $1,200,000? It's still a fair price for a product of this caliber. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions while keeping the price closer to my desired value. 
* **Compromise and Flexibility:** By suggesting a ""halfway"" price, I demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $1,200,000 is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, so I'm still in a good position. 
* **Next Steps:** Depending on Bob's response, I will be prepared to negotiate further or consider selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, but that's my maximum. Can you meet me at $1000000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but it doesn't leave any room for profit.
* **John's Offer is Equivalent:**  John is also offering $1,000,000.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the time pressure to get a higher price is mounting.  
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John immediately guarantees me my minimum price and removes the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

**Conclusion:**  While I would prefer a higher price, the current situation with Bob and the limited time remaining make selling to John the most sensible option at this point."
