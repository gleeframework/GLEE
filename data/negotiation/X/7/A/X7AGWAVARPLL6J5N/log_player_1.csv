Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Anchoring:**  By suggesting $120, you are setting a high anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the starting point influences his perception of a ""fair"" price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you'll at least get your minimum price. This allows you to be more ambitious with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or rejects your initial price."
