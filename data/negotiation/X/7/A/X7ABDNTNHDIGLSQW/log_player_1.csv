I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm curious to see what Bob's reaction is, and whether he's willing to play ball at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired value of $15,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer, but still higher than his $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm offering $14,500. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's clear we're at an impasse, and I'm satisfied with $14,000. It's above my minimum price, and I'm not confident that I can push for a higher price with further negotiation."
