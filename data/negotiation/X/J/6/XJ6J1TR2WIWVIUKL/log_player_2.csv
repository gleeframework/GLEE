Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $122? It's slightly above my initial offer but lower than my valuation. I believe this could be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $122 is a reasonable price, well below your $150 alternative.  Continuing to negotiate might frustrate Alice and risk losing the deal."
