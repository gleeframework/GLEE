Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. 
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which a deal is possible are between $800,001 (Bob would profit by $1) and $999,999 (you would profit by $999,999).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still giving Bob a compelling reason to accept.  Here's an approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I'm confident this represents a significant return on investment for you."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creates a sense of scarcity and value.
* **""Unique value and potential""**: Emphasizes the subjective value that might push Bob closer to his maximum.
* **$925,000 Price:** This price is a strong starting point within the ZOPA. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters while still securing a substantial profit for you. 
* **""Significant return on investment"":**  Frames the price in terms of Bob's potential gains.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Your Risk Tolerance:** If you want to guarantee a sale (and avoid any risk of Bob rejecting), you could propose a lower price closer to $850,000. However, this approach leaves potential profit on the table."
