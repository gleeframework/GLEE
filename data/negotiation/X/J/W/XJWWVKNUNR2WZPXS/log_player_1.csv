Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations a little higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and might make Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he haggles you down. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** While I know Bob values the product at $120, I'm starting above that. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium, especially if the product is something he really wants or needs.
* **Below John's Offer:** My offer is still below John's guaranteed purchase price of $150, ensuring I make a profit even if Bob negotiates me down a bit.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might outright reject this offer without counter-offering. However, it's a calculated risk to potentially maximize my profit."
