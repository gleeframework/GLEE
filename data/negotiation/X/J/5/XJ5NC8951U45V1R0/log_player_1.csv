"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it's perfect for you! I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is already at his maximum valuation of the product. There's no room for negotiation to get a better price from him.  It's best to sell to John for a guaranteed $80."
