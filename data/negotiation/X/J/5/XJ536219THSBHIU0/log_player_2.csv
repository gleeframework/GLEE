"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire something that will be a major asset.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a better deal than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,250,000, which is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **The product is worth more to Bob:**  While Alice values the product at $1,000,000, Bob values it at $1,500,000.  This means Bob is getting a great deal even at Alice's price. 

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $250,000 compared to buying from John."
