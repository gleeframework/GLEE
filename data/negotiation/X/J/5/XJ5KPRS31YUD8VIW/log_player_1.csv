"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me room to earn a profit.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm starting high, but not too high. This allows for negotiation while giving me leverage to potentially get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. It's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not going to accept a price that leaves me with less than my minimum value. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This will give me the opportunity to try and close the gap in price and potentially reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still offers you a good value. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my offer from $1,000,000 to $950,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a significant profit. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob and reiterating my willingness to negotiate. I'm also suggesting that finding a solution that works for both of us is important.

**Strategy:**

By reducing my offer, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal. However, I'm still holding out for a price that meets my minimum value. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't at least meet my minimum value.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer.  This will give me a chance to see if I can close the gap further and reach a deal closer to my target price.  I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John, which guarantees me my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This price is fair, considering the value of the product, and it allows us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my offer again, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. $925,000 is still above my minimum value, but it's closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm taking his perspective into account. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob and reiterating my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm also trying to frame the price as fair and reasonable to encourage acceptance.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to close the gap between our offers and hopefully reach a deal in the next few rounds. By being flexible and showing a willingness to compromise, I'm increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting my offer. However, I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John if the negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $920000, but that's as low as I can go. I really like the product and think it's worth it to me, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my target price, I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer ensures I'll make a decent profit, even if it's not my ideal outcome.  It's a calculated risk considering the limited rounds left and the possibility of not being able to get a better offer from Bob."
