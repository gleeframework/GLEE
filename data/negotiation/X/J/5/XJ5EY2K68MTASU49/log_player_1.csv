Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95.  This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 
I'm countering with $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $82 is only $2 less than what John is offering.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing out on a sale altogether."
