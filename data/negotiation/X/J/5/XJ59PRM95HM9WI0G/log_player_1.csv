``` 

This initial offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum value. This gives you some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product holds significant value to you, but my budget allows for a maximum of $9500. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping for a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer.  $9,500 is closer but still a bit below my minimum value.  Let's compromise. How about $9,750?  It's a fair middle ground and ensures we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I am proposing $9600 for the product. This amount aligns closely with my maximum spending limit while still offering a reasonable profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer of $9,600 is very close to my minimum value, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer from him. It's a good deal for me, and I'm happy to accept."
