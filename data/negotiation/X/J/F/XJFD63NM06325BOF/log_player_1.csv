Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe could be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and its potential benefit to your business. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to consider $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $12,000 is still a bit too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $12,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $13,500? This price reflects the product's value and gives you a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $13000? I'm confident this price reflects the product's value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $13,000 is a good compromise and still significantly higher than selling to John.  It's important to secure the sale, and I think there's a good chance Bob will be a satisfied customer."
