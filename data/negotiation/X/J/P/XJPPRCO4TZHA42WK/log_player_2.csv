"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's in great condition and worth a lot to the right person.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's starting price is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $120?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

Alice's offer of $120 matches my highest price and saves me the effort of further negotiation. There's no benefit to buying from John at the same price."
