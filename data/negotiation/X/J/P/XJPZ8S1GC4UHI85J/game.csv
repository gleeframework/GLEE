"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1200000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850000 for it. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. Considering the product's value to you is $800000, I'm willing to meet you at $950000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  While $950000 is still a bit above my budget, I'm prepared to offer $900000. This shows a significant commitment from my side, and I believe it allows for a fair profit on your end. I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $920000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit concerned that we're running out of room for negotiation. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price that works for both of us. This is my final offer at this price point.",920000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns about time, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $910000. This demonstrates my sincere desire to close this deal and represents a substantial compromise on my end. I truly hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",910000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your determination, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $915000, but I have to admit that I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work for both of us. This is my last offer above $900000.",915000.0,Alice,7,
