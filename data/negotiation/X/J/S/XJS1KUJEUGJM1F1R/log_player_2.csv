"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the return on investment you'll experience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,100,000 falls quite short of what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to make one final adjustment to seal the deal. How about we settle at $1,225,000? This allows me to recognize your limit while still reflecting the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

While I could try to push Alice a little further, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $1,225,000. Accepting this offer saves me $275,000 compared to John's price and is a reasonable compromise."
