"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product is valuable, but not that valuable.  How about we start the conversation at $250,000?",250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $250,000 is significantly below its true value.  This product is a game-changer, and I'm confident it will bring you immense returns.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but we're still pretty far apart. To be realistic, I can't go higher than $500,000 at this time.",500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a deal that works for both of us.  While $500,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential this product offers.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. However, the price is still a significant jump for me. How about we settle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. Let's split the difference. How about $925,000? This is my final offer.",925000.0,Alice,7,
