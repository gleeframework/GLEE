"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  This would still leave you a decent profit, and it's a fair price for the value I see in the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10,750. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200, which is a significant concession from my original price. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
