"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is more than your $10,000 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  $14,000 is below Bob's $15,000 value, so he has an incentive to accept.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By not starting at your maximum price, you signal flexibility. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $12,000 for it. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your desired profit margin.  There's still a chance to negotiate with Bob. You're likely to get a better price if you counteroffer, as Bob clearly sees the value of the product and is willing to pay more than $10,000. 

By rejecting his offer, you show that you're not desperate for a quick sale and are willing to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't accept $12,000. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? This gives you a good price, and it still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  By offering $13,000, you're showing a willingness to compromise while still staying above your minimum.
* **Positive phrasing:**  The message emphasizes the benefits for Bob (""good price"") and reinforces the possibility of closing the deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While a lower price, $13,000 is still a significant profit for you and allows for further negotiation if needed."
