# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, but I'll start with a price of $1800000. What do you think?

{""message"": ""Alice, $1,800,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $800000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $800,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, so I'm offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $800,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're committed to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```
