{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. There are 9 rounds left, giving Bob plenty of opportunities to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for compromise. It's also important to express interest in the product to keep Alice engaged in the negotiation."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,250. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit steep for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,750?  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly higher offer:** Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round to show he's willing to compromise. 
* **Final offer statement:**  Bob is setting a sense of urgency by stating this is his final offer. This could pressure Alice to accept, especially since she's already lowered her price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value you place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us if we keep talking.  How about $11,000? It's a fair price that allows us to both come to an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
