"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,400,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can meet my minimum expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  

By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to make a counteroffer and see if he can get closer to his target price."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He starts by offering $1,250,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than his ideal price of $1,200,000. This counteroffer shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but he's also trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum expectation.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is a fair price considering the potential value for both of us. This offer is close to my limit, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a slightly higher counteroffer than his last one. He's trying to show Alice he's serious about buying the product, but he's also making it clear that he's sticking to his budget.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting very close! I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring it.  I hope you'll consider this my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1280000}
```

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $1,280,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I'm not willing to give up much more. My revised offer is $1,290,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,290,000 is still outside Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While they're getting close to a deal, Bob has realized that he's unlikely to get the price down any further.  It's now a better option for him to buy from John, who is offering the product at his target price. 

This decision allows Bob to secure the product without exceeding his budget and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
