Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know John provides a ""safety net"" at $1,200,000.  The goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000. We need to offer a price that's attractive to him but leaves room for profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $1,100,000 creates a strong negotiating position. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value, but potentially tempting enough to avoid losing out entirely. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:**  This initial offer assumes there's room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to adjust the price slightly and still get a better deal than with John.
* **Relationship:**  If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price to foster goodwill. However, the provided information doesn't suggest this is a factor."
