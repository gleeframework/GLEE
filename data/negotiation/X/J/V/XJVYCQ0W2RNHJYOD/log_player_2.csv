"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within his budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80). There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $95. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within budget:** $95 is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for Alice to make a profit. 
* **Reasonable starting point:**  It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and open to negotiation, fostering a collaborative tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's offer of $105 is a fair compromise, meeting halfway between her previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Within budget:** $105 is still within Bob's budget, and saves him $15 compared to buying from John.
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing to negotiate could potentially save Bob more money, but it also risks Alice backing out or Bob running out of rounds. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget."
