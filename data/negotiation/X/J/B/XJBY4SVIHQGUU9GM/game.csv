"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand your budget concerns, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9500. This still allows for a fair profit for me while acknowledging your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'd like to offer $9000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,4,
