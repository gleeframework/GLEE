"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  $75 is a good starting point, but you might be able to get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

$60 is a good deal, especially since Alice rejected your counteroffer. There's no guarantee you'll get a better price if you keep negotiating, and you're already within your budget."
