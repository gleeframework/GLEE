,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1800000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1900000. This is my best and final counteroffer for now.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1900000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1750000. Can you consider this?",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting closer, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1825000. This is my best compromise for now.",1825000.0,Alice,5,
