"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $110 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I can do $125, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway at $125, and $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $128?",128.0,Alice,5,
