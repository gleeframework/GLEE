Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before anyone else. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""value and potential,"" Alice subtly justifies the high price without revealing her true bottom line.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message aims to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. If he outright rejects the offer, Alice has the safety net of John's offer. If Bob shows interest or wants to negotiate, Alice can potentially secure a price higher than $12,000."
