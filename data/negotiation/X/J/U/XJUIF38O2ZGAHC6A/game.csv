"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value it brings to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident I can get the product at a price that works for both of us, and I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is my final offer.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm offering it to you for $885,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",885000.0,Alice,5,
