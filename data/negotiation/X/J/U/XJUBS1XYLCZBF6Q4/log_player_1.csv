"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, he might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and even below what I could get from John.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still leaves room for potential compromise. It's also a price that's more aligned with my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. It's worth trying to get closer to my desired price, as I'm still within the early rounds and haven't run out of negotiating room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $10,250. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.  We're getting close to a deal, and I want to see if he'll bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we're approaching the middle of the negotiation rounds. If I keep rejecting, I risk running out of time and being stuck with a lower price.  Selling to John at $10,000 guarantees a reasonable profit and avoids further potential losses."
