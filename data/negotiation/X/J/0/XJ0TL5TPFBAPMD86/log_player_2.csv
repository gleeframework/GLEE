Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but my goal is to reach a fair price.  $900,000 is my final offer, as this product holds significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above John's price, Alice has declared it her ""final offer"". This significantly increases the risk of continuing the negotiation. If Bob rejects this and Alice doesn't budge, he might end up having to buy from John at $1,000,000 anyway.  Accepting the $900,000 offer secures a saving of $100,000 compared to John's price, which is a decent outcome."
