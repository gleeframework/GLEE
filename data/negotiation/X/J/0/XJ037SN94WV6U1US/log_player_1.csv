{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $100, but it's still lower than your minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but it also sets a firm baseline for the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go as low as $100. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
