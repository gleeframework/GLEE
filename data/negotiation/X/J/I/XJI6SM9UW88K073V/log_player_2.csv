"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $100.** This is lower than your maximum price of $120, so it's a good deal. 
* **Buying from John for $120 is a worse option** since Alice's offer is lower."
