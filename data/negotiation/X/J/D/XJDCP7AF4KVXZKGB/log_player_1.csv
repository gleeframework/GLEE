Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much from Bob as possible, knowing we have a guaranteed $150 from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially getting us closer to $150. 
* **High Enough Above Bob's Value:**  While $140 is more than Bob values the product at ($100), it's not so high that it's an immediate turn-off. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable or scarce.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we are aiming for a single offer and not engaging in prolonged negotiation."
