Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $87.50.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to negotiate further, Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground and we are already above my minimum acceptable price. Accepting the $87.50 offer is a good compromise to ensure a sale."
