"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $95. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** My offer is $10 below Alice's initial price. This is a significant move but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Value:** My offer is still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80), giving her a potential profit.
* **Fairness:**  I'm not offering a ridiculously low price, demonstrating good faith in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my offer, but $90 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  It's worth trying to negotiate further.  I still have more rounds and can always choose to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $87.50.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of Alice's last offer ($90) and my previous offer ($85). This shows a willingness to meet her halfway.
* **Reasonable:** $87.50 is still a profitable price for Alice, considering the product's value to her ($80).
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing closing the deal, adding a bit of pressure to get Alice to accept."
