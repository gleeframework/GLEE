"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth much more to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you recognizing its value to me, but $14,000 is still a bit high.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Strategy:** Bob is aiming to start the negotiation process. A counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer shows he's serious about getting a good deal.
* **Value Range:** $12,000 is within Bob's maximum budget and leaves room for potential compromise.  
* **Politeness:**  Bob is maintaining a positive tone while still being firm in his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $12000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13000?  That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Compromise:**  Alice's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise, splitting the difference between her previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Potential Savings:** This price saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a chance Alice might become unwilling to negotiate further. It's more beneficial to secure a good deal now rather than risk losing the opportunity for a lower price."
