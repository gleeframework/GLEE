"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $15,000.",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500. This would still give you a healthy profit and allow me to get a great deal.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a compromise that should satisfy both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
