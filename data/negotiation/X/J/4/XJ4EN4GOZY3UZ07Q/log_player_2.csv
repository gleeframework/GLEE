"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $7,500. This is a great price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, $7,500 is a great starting point. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,250. This is a great compromise that still provides value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $7,250 is a good price, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a small decrease in price.  It's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
