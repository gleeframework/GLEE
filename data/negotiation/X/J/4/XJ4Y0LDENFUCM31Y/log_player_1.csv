"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, knowing that the product is worth $8,000 to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the value to Bob, hoping to make the offer seem more attractive. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter. 

I'll be ready to negotiate further if Bob rejects my offer.  I'll also be mindful of the 10-round limit and the backup option of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my desired price and doesn't come close to the $15,000 I could get from John.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Even though Bob has lowered his offer, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Conserving options:** I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, trying to meet him somewhere in the middle. I'll keep in mind that I have a maximum of 10 rounds to close the deal and that selling to John is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a good price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $10,500 is halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.  
* **Highlighting value again:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product, hoping to convince Bob that $10,500 is a good deal.
* **Showing flexibility:** By lowering my price, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 

I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer. If he doesn't, I'll be prepared to adjust my strategy further depending on his response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob's offer of $9,800 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for.
* **More room for negotiation:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, as there's still some room for negotiation.
* **Minimizing losses:** While selling to John is always an option, I don't want to give up on Bob's potential yet.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  I'll keep in mind the 10-round limit and my alternative of selling to John, but I'm still hopeful of closing a deal with Bob at a more favorable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's split the difference and go with $10,100. It's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 10100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:**  This offer is halfway between my previous offer of $10,500 and Bob's offer of $9,800.
* **Urgency and Finality:** I'm emphasizing the need for a compromise and using phrases like ""Let's split the difference"" and ""Let's get this deal done!"" to nudge Bob towards acceptance.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  By this point, I hope Bob is feeling the pressure of time and may be more willing to compromise to avoid further negotiation. 

I'm hoping that this final push will be enough to convince Bob to accept the offer. If not, I'll have to seriously consider my options, including selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly below my desired price point and what I could get from John. 
* **Limited rounds:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and time is becoming a factor.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I still believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for a price that's so far from my ideal.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer again in the next round. I'll aim for a price slightly higher than his offer, perhaps $9,750, hoping to find a compromise within a few rounds. However, if Bob continues to refuse and we approach the final rounds, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as my minimum price is $15,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but I'm also committed to getting a fair price for my product.  Let's try $9,750. This is a small step from your offer, and I'm hoping it's something we can both agree on.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** This offer is halfway between my previous offer of $10,100 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This shows I am willing to compromise. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm reframing the negotiation as finding a fair price for both of us, making it less about my desire for a high price and more about a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Urgency:** I'm using phrases like ""Let's try"" and ""Let's make this happen!"" to encourage Bob to accept and prevent further rounds of negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to make a final offer in the next round. I'm considering either dropping my price to $9,600 or sticking at $9,750 and offering to sweeten the deal with a small bonus or perk.  But I'll also be ready to sell to John if necessary, as the deal with Bob is getting more challenging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited rounds:** We're down to our last two rounds of negotiation.
* **Unlikely to reach my price:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is not close to my desired price, and his stance suggests he's unlikely to budge further.
* **Minimizing risk:** With the 10-round limit approaching, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob increases. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John at $15,000 guarantees me a profit, which is the most important objective at this point.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob at a higher price, the risk of not getting there and losing time is too great. I'm choosing to sell to John, ensuring a profitable outcome."
