"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's best to reject and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer. $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $10,000 right now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're starting with a strong counteroffer at our maximum budget.  It's a bold move, but it establishes our willingness to buy while immediately showcasing the significant gap between our offer and Alice's price. This will set the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $14000. It's a good middle ground between our initial offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above my budget.  It shows a willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to save more.  I will counteroffer again to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $12,000. I believe this is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're raising our offer slightly from $10,000 to $12,000. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, but it keeps us comfortably below our budget. It also creates a smaller gap between our offers, potentially increasing the chances of a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $13500. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $13,500 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us.  I'll make a counteroffer again, aiming to close the gap even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there with $13,500. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're offering $13,000, which is a compromise between Alice's last offer and our previous offer. This demonstrates a willingness to be flexible and find common ground.  It also shows we are serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $13000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make another small concession. I'm thinking of a price of $13200. It's a tiny increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is continuing to negotiate and is getting closer to my budget, $13,200 is still above my comfort zone. With only 3 rounds left, I'm concerned that we might not reach a satisfactory price. It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John for $10,000.  It's a safe option that allows me to acquire the product without risking further negotiation and potentially losing out on a good deal."
