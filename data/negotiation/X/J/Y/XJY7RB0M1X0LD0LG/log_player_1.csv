"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to give up that much profit just yet. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $100 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for the product's value.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 110}
