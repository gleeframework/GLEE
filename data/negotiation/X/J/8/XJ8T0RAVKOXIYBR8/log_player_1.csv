"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a steal for its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $15,000, knowing the product is worth at least $10,000 to me. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language (""fantastic"", ""perfect"", ""steal"") to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open ended:** My message invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob right away. I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can always sell to John for the same price.  

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Test the waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher.
* **Gain leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I show that I'm not willing to settle for his initial price. 
* **Maintain value:**  Selling to John is always an option, but I'm hoping to get more than $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but also showing I'm open to negotiation.
* **Middle Ground:** $12,500 is halfway between my initial offer ($15,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000).  
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing fairness to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Bob has increased his offer, showing he's willing to negotiate.
* **Potential for More:** While $11,000 is tempting, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Strategic Rejection:**  By rejecting again, I maintain pressure on Bob and signal that I'm not desperate for a quick sale.

I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm happy to see we're making progress. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within your budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:**  I've lowered my price again, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Appeal to fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" that benefits both of us.
* **Maintain pressure:**  I'm still not at Bob's offer, keeping the negotiation active."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $11500. I'm willing to pay $11250. This feels like a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the deal:**  Bob has increased his offer again, and we're now very close to a deal.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I could try to squeeze out a bit more, it's getting late in the negotiation. There's a risk that Bob will walk away if I keep rejecting offers.
* **Good profit:**  $11,250 is a significant profit compared to selling to John for $10,000.

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a profitable sale and avoid further risk."
