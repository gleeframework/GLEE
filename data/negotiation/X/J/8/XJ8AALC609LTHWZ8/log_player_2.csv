# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Bob should reject the offer.  $900,000 is still too high, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $925,000 is better than her first offer, it's still a bit high for Bob.  He should counteroffer again and try to bring the price down further."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although $912,500 is lower than previous offers, it's still too high.  He should counteroffer again, trying to close the gap.  It's likely Alice is getting closer to her lower limit, and Bob might be able to get a good deal by persisting."

I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $800,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice's Bottom Line:**  Alice clearly stated she won't go lower than $900,000.  She's even willing to sell to John for $800,000 if she doesn't get this price from Bob.
* **Better Than John:**  $900,000 is significantly less than buying from John for $1,200,000.
* **Slight Compromise:** While Bob would have liked to pay less, he's already made a good amount of progress in negotiations.  Accepting the offer is a small compromise to secure the product at a good price."
