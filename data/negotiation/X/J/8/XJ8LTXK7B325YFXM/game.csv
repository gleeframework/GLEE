"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
