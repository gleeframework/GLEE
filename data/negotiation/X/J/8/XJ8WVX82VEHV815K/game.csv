"Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price, as it reflects the true value of the product to both of us.  I believe this deal is mutually beneficial. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be selling it to another buyer for the same price.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
