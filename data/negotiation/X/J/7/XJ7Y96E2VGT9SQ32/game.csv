"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could meet you halfway at $15,000. This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,3,
