"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident we can agree on a price that works for both of us. To start things off, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is far above my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could meet you halfway at $15,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, it's unlikely she will go lower, and I don't want to risk wasting time. It's best to take the guaranteed deal with John for $8,000."
