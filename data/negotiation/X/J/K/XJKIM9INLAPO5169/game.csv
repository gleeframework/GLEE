"I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price. While $1500000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to bridge the gap a bit.  I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1750000. This price still reflects the product's unique value and allows for a fair margin for both of us. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
