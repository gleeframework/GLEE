"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point, as it allows for some negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'll be keeping an eye on Bob's reaction to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm reducing my price to $14,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my initial offer.  I'm hoping this compromise will entice Bob to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price,  $11,500 is still too low. I'll counter with a price that's a bit higher than his offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is halfway between my last offer and Bob's latest offer. It shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still confident the product is worth more than his offer.  I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiation is getting increasingly difficult. While I'm not getting my desired price from Bob, I'm getting closer to my minimum. However, with only 4 rounds left, it's becoming risky to keep negotiating. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and allows me to avoid further negotiation with Bob."
