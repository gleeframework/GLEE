Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Value:** I emphasize the value to Bob, making the offer seem more attractive.
* **Openness:** I use a friendly tone and invite Bob to share his thoughts, encouraging a back-and-forth.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good deal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if it's better to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's willing to negotiate. There's still room to find a price closer to my target.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum price, but I might be able to get more by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  The risk is that the negotiation could fail, and I'd have to settle for John's offer.  However, the potential reward of a higher price outweighs the risk at this stage.

**Next Steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still offers you a significant savings compared to its value to you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I've rejected Bob's offer but presented a counteroffer that's still significantly higher than his initial proposal. This shows I'm serious about selling, but also that I'm not willing to drastically lower my price.
* **Value Proposition:** I've again highlighted the value to Bob, emphasizing the potential savings he'll get at this price. 
* **Openness:**  I've used a positive and encouraging tone, inviting Bob to continue the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! We've found a price that works for both of us. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing negotiations or if I should just sell to John to guarantee my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This is a good outcome considering my initial asking price was higher. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that the negotiations could break down and I'd be forced to sell to John for a lower price.  At this point, accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit and avoids further risk. 
* **Time Consideration:**  Continuing negotiations could take more time, and I might not be able to secure a significantly better price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and complete the transaction."
