"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $1500000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1600000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $1520000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1520000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1520000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower than that. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
