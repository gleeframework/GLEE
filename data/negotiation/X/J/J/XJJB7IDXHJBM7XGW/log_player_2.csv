"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product at a price of $14,000. I believe this product will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for less from John, and there's a chance he can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $12,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product is worth a significant amount to me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This is a good compromise. He gets the product for less than John's price, and Alice still makes a profit."
