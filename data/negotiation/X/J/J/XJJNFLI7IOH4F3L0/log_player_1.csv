Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, he's moving slowly, and it's unlikely he'll reach $1,200,000 in the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk getting even less from Bob as we continue to negotiate."
