Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's reaction to this initial offer will give you insight into his level of interest and potential budget. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob."
