"I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still not satisfied with the price, Bob. However, I'm getting close to considering other offers. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $1000000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
