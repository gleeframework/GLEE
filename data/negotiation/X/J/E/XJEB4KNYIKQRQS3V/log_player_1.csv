Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value of $150. I want to leave room for negotiation, but I also want to make sure I don't undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $120, as it's significantly lower than my minimum value. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm offering $175. This is a compromise, but still leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $140 is still lower than I would like, but it is closer to my minimum value of $150.  Considering I can always sell to John for $150, accepting Bob's offer allows me to make a profit.  I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
