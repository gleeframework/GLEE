Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it leaves some room for negotiation.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Profit:**  This price gives me the highest potential profit.
* **Negotiation Room:**  If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to negotiate a bit lower. If he's not, I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 
* **Testing the Market:** This offer helps me gauge Bob's interest level and potential budget.
