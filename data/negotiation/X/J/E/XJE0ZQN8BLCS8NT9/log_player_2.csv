"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth $800000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $800,000.  You have room to negotiate and try to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to buy the product for $850,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product for $875000. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows you to push for a lower price, potentially securing a better deal. You can counter with a price closer to your target and see if Alice is willing to budge further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is getting closer to my target, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $825,000 for the product. This is a very fair price considering its value to me, and it leaves you with a substantial profit.  Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to maximize my profit. I'm willing to sell the product for $850000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This price takes into account the value it holds for you and still leaves me with a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is closer to your target price. You could try to negotiate further, but at this point, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $800,000 is high.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price that's still within your budget."
