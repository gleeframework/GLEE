"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I know you'll value it highly, and this price allows you a substantial profit. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

Alice's offer is a bit high. There's room to negotiate a better price. By rejecting the offer, you might be able to get Alice to come down, or you can always fall back on buying from John at $15,000."
