Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for potential negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $110. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his, and hopefully, it will be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
