"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,600,000. It's worth $1,500,000 to you, so this is a great opportunity to acquire it at a slight premium. I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up at $1,500,000, so let me know your decision as soon as you can.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
