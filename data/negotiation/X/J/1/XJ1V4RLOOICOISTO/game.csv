"I understand you're getting a bit frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to make one final compromise, but I need to get at least $1000 above my minimum price. I'll meet you at $1200000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
