"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly below what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something around $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as I can. Can you consider my offer?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $11,000? This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,750? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to get the product.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be closer to my last offer.  How about $10,900? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your last offer, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers again. How about $10,675? This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10675.0,Bob,6,
