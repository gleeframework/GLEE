"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm going to need to come in a bit lower than your initial price. I'm ready to offer $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate further. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",925000.0,Alice,3,
