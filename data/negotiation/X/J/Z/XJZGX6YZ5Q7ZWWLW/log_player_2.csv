"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your business.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John.  We'll start by rejecting her offer and see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which would still give you a good profit.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I need to stay closer to my initial price to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm confident this price still provides you with a strong return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still a bit high, but we're making progress.  Let's try another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $875,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this work.  Let's try $890,000.  This is a small step closer to your offer and allows us to find some middle ground.  I'm confident this is a price that provides you with a great value for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

We've been chipping away at the price and are getting close to our target.  $890,000 is a good deal, and it's better than going with John at $1,000,000."
