"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I could consider a price of $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a substantial amount considering my needs.  This offer is fair and allows us to conclude the deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
