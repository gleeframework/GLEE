{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also sets the tone that I'm willing to compromise but not give it away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a nice product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $117.50? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 117.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $117.50 is getting closer.  How about $110, would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a bit more,  $110 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement over John's offer and close enough to my ideal price that it's worth accepting."
