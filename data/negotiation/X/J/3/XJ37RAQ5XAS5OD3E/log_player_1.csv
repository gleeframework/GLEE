I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm also highlighting the value of the product and my investment to justify the price.  This should open the door for a productive negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm confident that John will buy the product for a price that meets my minimum requirement.  It's better to accept the guaranteed price from John than to risk a deal with Bob that might fall through."
