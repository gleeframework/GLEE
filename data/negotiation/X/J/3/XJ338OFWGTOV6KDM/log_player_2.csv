# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Would you like to make an offer of $10000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the same price as buying from John.  Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, buying from John is the optimal choice. There's no reason to risk rejecting Alice's offer and potentially ending up with no product."
