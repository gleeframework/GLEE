Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that might be of interest to you. I'm willing to sell it for $100.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100 offer:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Friendly message:** I'm trying to be friendly and engaging to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **No pressure:** I'm not putting any pressure on Bob to accept immediately. I'm simply presenting the offer and allowing him to decide. 

This strategy balances the need to maximize my profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $80, ensuring I don't lose money."
