Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $100. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Profit:** Bob values the product at $120, so there's potential to sell it for more than your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering the product at $100 splits the difference between your minimum ($80) and Bob's maximum ($120), making it a fair deal that benefits both parties.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have a backup buyer (John) at $80, aiming higher with Bob first maximizes your potential profit. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
