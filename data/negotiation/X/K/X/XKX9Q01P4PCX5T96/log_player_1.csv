Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation while still potentially exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value.  This approach allows you to assess Bob's interest and flexibility without being overly aggressive.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The offer doesn't start at your absolute highest point. If Bob counters, there's space to negotiate and potentially settle on a price that's still very favorable for you. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable potentially losing Bob as a buyer if he finds the initial price too high."
