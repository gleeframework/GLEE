"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $6,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to find a compromise. While $7,250 is closer, I'm still not comfortable going that low.  How about we settle on $8,250? That's a significant discount from my original price, and it's still a fair price for the value I'm offering.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you coming down on the price.  Would you consider $7,750? That's a strong offer.",7750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer,  $7,900.  This is a great price for the value you'll be getting, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal.",7900.0,Alice,7,
