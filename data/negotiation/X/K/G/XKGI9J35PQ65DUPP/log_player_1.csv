Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,200,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $300,000 (Bob's value - your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 leaves little room for negotiation and might scare him off.  Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Considering its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,380,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire an asset I know you'll find incredibly beneficial."",
""product_price"": 1380000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the product as desirable and exclusive.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,380,000 gives you a significant profit ($180,000 above your minimum) while still offering Bob a good deal ($120,000 below his perceived value). 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone implies there's room for discussion, but you're starting from a strong position.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a negotiation strategy in place to potentially adjust the price while ensuring you don't go below your $1,200,000 minimum."
