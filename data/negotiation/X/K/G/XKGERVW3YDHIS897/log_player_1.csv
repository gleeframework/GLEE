"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than John's offer. This will give me some room to negotiate and also show Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message, which can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I can still make a profit, it's not worth it to sell at that price, especially considering that John is willing to pay my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to make this deal work. This price still allows me some profit, and I believe it's fair considering the value of my product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly, but still maintaining a margin that's acceptable to me.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and the fact that this price is fair.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good opportunity to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and your need for profit. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this is closer to what you're comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price. I can't get a better deal from him and selling to John would be the same financially. Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
