"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a decent price, it's still above Alice's value of $12,000.  This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $14,000 is a bit high for me right now.  How about $13,000? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob is aiming for a price that is closer to Alice's value, but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes that Bob is interested in the product and believes the counteroffer is fair to both parties. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** $13,000 allows Alice some wiggle room to counter without feeling pressured."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $13000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $13500? I think it's a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress Made:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Fair Compromise:** $13,500 is a fair compromise that meets halfway between Bob's initial counteroffer ($13,000) and Alice's previous offer ($14,000).
* **Value:**  The price is still within Bob's budget and significantly better than buying from John for $15,000. 

Accepting the offer saves Bob $500 compared to buying from John and is a good outcome for both parties."
