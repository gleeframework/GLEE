"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to offer $850000 for it. This is my best price, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1100000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $950000, which represents a significant step towards your asking price while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's continue to find a solution that benefits us both.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to listen to your concerns and find a mutually beneficial solution. However, $950000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer you the product for $1075000. This is the best price I can offer considering the product's value to you and my own requirements.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1075000 is closer to my target, it's still slightly out of reach.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it. Let's work together to bridge this gap and finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1000000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $1125000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to you and my own requirements. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
