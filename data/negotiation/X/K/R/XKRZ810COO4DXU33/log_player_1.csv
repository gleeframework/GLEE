Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in hearing more about it? If so, I'm offering it for $14,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a strategic price.**  It's significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000) but still leaves room for Bob to get a good deal ($1,000 in savings). 
* **The message is friendly and inviting.**  It emphasizes the value to Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.

**Why this approach is good:**

* **Maximizes potential profit:**  $14,000 is a good price for me, while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Reduces risk of rejection:** The friendly message and fair price increase the likelihood of Bob accepting. 
* **Provides a fallback option:** Even if Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000."
