"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a premium price of $14,000. I believe it's worth even more than this, but I'm giving you the opportunity to purchase it before I offer it to others.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $8,000. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, but $14,000 is still too high a drop from my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. While $11,000 is closer, I'm afraid my absolute limit is $9,000 for this product. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal. ",9000.0,Bob,4,
