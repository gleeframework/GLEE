Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $825,000. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $800,000 rather than risk Alice holding firm or further negotiations."
