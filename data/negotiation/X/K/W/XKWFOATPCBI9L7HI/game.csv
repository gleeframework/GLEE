"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits it can bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a little high for me. How about $950,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
