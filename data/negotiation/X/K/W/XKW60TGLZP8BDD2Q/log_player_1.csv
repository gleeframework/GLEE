"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is close to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I want to see if I can push Bob further and potentially get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show good faith and encourage Bob to continue negotiations. However,  I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to Bob's initial valuation, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value. It's worth exploring if I can push for a better deal or potentially take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at my minimum acceptable value. I believe this is a fair price given Bob's valuation and my own need to get at least $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiation is unlikely to yield a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.  Even though Bob has increased his offer, it's still lower than what I need.  Therefore, selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option to guarantee my desired profit."
