"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $11,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it.  I'm really looking to get the product for closer to $9,500.  That's my best offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to $10,500.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. At $10,500, Bob is getting a significant discount from John's offer and is still paying less than Alice's initial offer. It's a good deal for Bob, so he should accept."
