"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Respectful:**  Maintaining a positive tone is important in negotiations. I want to show Alice I'm serious about the purchase while also standing firm on my budget. 
* **Strategic Goal:** My ideal outcome is to get the price closer to my $10,000 limit. By starting low, I'm hoping to meet Alice somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming closer to my budget, $10,500 is still above my ideal price and what John is offering. I'll make another counteroffer to try and close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that's roughly halfway between my last offer ($8,000) and Alice's current offer ($10,500). This shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above John's Price:** I'm still aiming for a price lower than John's offer ($10,000), as that represents my absolute limit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** As rounds progress, I'm making smaller jumps in my counteroffers to signal that I'm getting closer to my final decision point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my target price! There's no point in negotiating further or going with John, as they are both offering the product at $10,000. Accepting now secures the deal."
