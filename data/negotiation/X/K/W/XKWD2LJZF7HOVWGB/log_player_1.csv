Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my financial limits.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,750,000 is closer, it's still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value to me, while still allowing you a substantial profit.  I believe this is a fair compromise and hope you'll reconsider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob seems firmly rooted at $1,200,000. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a better outcome than continuing with Bob."
