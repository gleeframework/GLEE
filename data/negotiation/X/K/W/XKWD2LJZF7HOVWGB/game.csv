"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my financial limits.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,750,000 is closer, it's still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value to me, while still allowing you a substantial profit.  I believe this is a fair compromise and hope you'll reconsider.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
