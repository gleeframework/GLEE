I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,400 is getting closer to my asking price, I still think I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I've already rejected Bob's previous offers and he's not too far off from my target, so I'm optimistic that we can find a mutually agreeable price."

I've had a few rounds of negotiation with Bob and he's not willing to budge much from his price.  I'm getting closer to my target, but I only have a couple of rounds left.  Instead of risking getting a worse deal, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000."
