"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,100,000
* **Your Max Value:** $1,200,000
* **John's Price:** $1,200,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate with Alice further, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
