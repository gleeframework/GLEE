"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, however, I can't accept a price that low. This product has a lot of potential and I'm confident in its value. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price point. Would you consider $1,825,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,825,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,500,000.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
