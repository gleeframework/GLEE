Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I need to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe I can get closer to my goal with further negotiation.  I have 8 rounds left, and John is always an option if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 simply won't work for me. Given the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. It's a fair price that reflects the potential benefits you'll gain. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I still need to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $1,400,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, but $1,400,000 is still below my minimum. I have 6 rounds left and I'm confident I can get closer to my target.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob first."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is a significant concession. Let's make this deal happen.  This is my final offer before I move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction, but I still need to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $1,450,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still holding firm at a price lower than my minimum. With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time to reach a more favorable agreement.  While I would like to get closer to my goal, selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation. It's a more secure and time-efficient option."
