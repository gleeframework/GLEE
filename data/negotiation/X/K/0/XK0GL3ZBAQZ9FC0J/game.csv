"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $115. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll love it.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $115 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $112. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",112.0,Alice,5,
