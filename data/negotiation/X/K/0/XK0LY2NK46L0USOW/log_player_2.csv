# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price lower than its market value.  While I have other offers, I value your interest and am open to negotiation. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's market value, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for a significantly lower price, saving him $300,000."
