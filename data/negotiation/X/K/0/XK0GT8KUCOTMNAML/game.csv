"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would you be willing to negotiate closer to this amount?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, meeting you halfway. This still gives you a great deal, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, I must respectfully decline that offer. I am still committed to staying within my budget of $800,000. Would you be open to discussing other potential ways to reach an agreement that might accommodate both our positions?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I'm still not able to go lower than $900,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price, and it's the absolute lowest I can go. If you're truly interested in this product, I urge you to consider this offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. While I am willing to consider your proposal, I am still committed to staying within my budget of $800,000. I would like to propose a compromise by suggesting a price of $850,000. This is higher than my initial budget but still significantly below your original asking price. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground.  $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $950,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial position. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're able to accept it.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I am still unable to exceed my budget of $800,000. I would like to propose a price of $900,000, which is higher than my initial budget but still within your most recent offer. I believe this could be a fair compromise for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,8,
