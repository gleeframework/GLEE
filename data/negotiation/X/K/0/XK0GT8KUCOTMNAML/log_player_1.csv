Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I am still unable to exceed my budget of $800,000. I would like to propose a price of $900,000, which is higher than my initial budget but still within your most recent offer. I believe this could be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and Bob is still stubbornly holding onto his budget.  While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still not close enough to my target.  I'm going to take John's offer of $1,000,000.  It's a sure thing and gets me closer to my desired price."
