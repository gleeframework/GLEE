I'm starting high, aiming for my full value. If Bob rejects, I'll consider dropping to a lower price, but I'm confident John will be happy to buy it for my full asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

$900,000 is too low for me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still need to make a decent profit.  $1,100,000 is a fair compromise, considering Bob's value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not comfortable selling for less than $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer again."

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but I'm firm on this price.  If he rejects, I'll go with John."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not worth it to me to keep negotiating.  I'd rather sell to John for my full asking price."
