"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",170.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",145.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $125? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer you the product for $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",135.0,Alice,5,
