Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. This price is fair, considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford at this time. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise,  considering we're both approaching a middle ground. What do you think?

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $1,000,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
