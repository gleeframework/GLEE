"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. This price is fair, considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:** Bob starts his counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating his intention to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:**  Bob provides a clear reason for his offer, appealing to Alice's value and his own budget. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  The counteroffer leaves room for negotiation,  allowing for potential compromises in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,050,000 is still above Bob's ideal price range.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a better deal.  There are still rounds remaining, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford at this time. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise,  considering we're both approaching a middle ground. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob acknowledges Alice's compromise but reiterates his desire for a lower price.
* **Fair Offer:**  Bob presents his offer as a fair compromise, emphasizing a meeting point.
* **Direct Appeal:**  Bob asks for Alice's opinion directly, encouraging further negotiation."
