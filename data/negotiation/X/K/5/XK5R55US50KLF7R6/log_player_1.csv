Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I think we can find a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about $750000?

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find common ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget constraints, how about $825000?

Bob's offer of $825,000 is slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John."
