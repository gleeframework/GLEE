"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,050,000? I believe this would still be a fair reflection of the product's worth while allowing me to stay within my financial limits.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your desire to stay within budget.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I'm confident this price reflects the product's true value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
