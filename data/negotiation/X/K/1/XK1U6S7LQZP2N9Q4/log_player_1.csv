Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, it's clear he's very reluctant to move much higher than $1,080,000. Continuing negotiations will likely result in minimal gains. Selling to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000 is the more profitable and less risky option."
