Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8,750. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product brings.

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $8,000 maximum. While Alice's offer is better than her initial price, there's still room for further negotiation."

Bob has been trying to negotiate a price closer to his $8,000 limit. Alice's latest offer is $8,700, which is still slightly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to get him a significantly lower price."
