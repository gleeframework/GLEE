"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially exceeding $1200000.  While I can't disclose the specific details at this time, I'm confident it aligns with your interests. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This price reflects the potential upside and allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget, and she hasn't provided any compelling reason to believe her product is worth more than $1,500,000. Since you can get the same product from John for the same price, it's safer to reject Alice's offer."
