Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations here.  While I want to find a solution, I need to be mindful of the product's worth.  How about we try $9,000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents significant value for you while remaining fair to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

It's time to cut our losses. Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and it's still above our maximum budget and John's offer. There's no point in continuing to negotiate if we're unlikely to reach a price we're comfortable with."
