"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,500 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $9,750, reflecting a fair compromise for both of us.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $9,750 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could we settle on $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations here.  While I want to find a solution, I need to be mindful of the product's worth.  How about we try $9,000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents significant value for you while remaining fair to me.",9000.0,Alice,5,
