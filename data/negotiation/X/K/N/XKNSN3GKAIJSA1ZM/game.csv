"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiating.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $90 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $75? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $75 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference at $85? I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, my absolute top limit is $80. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to buy it right now.",80.0,Bob,6,
