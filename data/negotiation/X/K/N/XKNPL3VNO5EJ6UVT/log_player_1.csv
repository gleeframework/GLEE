{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I've started with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly and open tone can help build rapport with Bob and make him more likely to engage.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Explicitly mentioning that I'm open to negotiation shows flexibility and willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay.  By leaving room for negotiation, I can adapt my approach based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not eager to settle immediately. I'm going to try and get a little closer to my original asking price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price slightly higher than $120. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but also want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $135 is the lowest I can go. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial price.
* **Moderate Counteroffer:** The $135 counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that still allows for some profit.
* **Clear Communication:**  I'm clearly stating my new offer and providing an opportunity for Bob to accept or reject it.

**Strategy:**

By taking a small step towards Bob's offer, I'm hoping to create a sense of progress and encourage him to make a final counteroffer that's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 less than my minimum acceptable price and only $5 less than what John is willing to pay.  It's a small difference, and accepting his offer allows me to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  

**Strategy:**

This decision is driven by a balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk.  While I could try to get a slightly better price, the potential gains are minimal compared to the risk of losing the sale altogether."
