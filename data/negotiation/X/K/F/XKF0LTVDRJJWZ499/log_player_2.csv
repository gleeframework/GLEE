Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I really need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $110, which is just $10 away from my target. I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's unlikely to go below $110. While she might budge a little more, it's getting risky.  You have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $100, saving you at least $10 and the uncertainty of further negotiation."
