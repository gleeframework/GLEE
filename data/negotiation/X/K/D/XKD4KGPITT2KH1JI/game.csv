"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $90, so I'll offer $97.50 for the product. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
