Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
