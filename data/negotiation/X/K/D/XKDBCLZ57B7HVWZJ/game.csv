"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1050000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1150000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
