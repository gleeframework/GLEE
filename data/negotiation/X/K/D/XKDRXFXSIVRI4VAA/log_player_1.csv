Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive and Engaging:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. I'll be prepared to negotiate lower if needed, but I'll always keep my minimum price of $15,000 in mind.  I'll also be ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **No Room for Improvement:**  There's no guarantee I can get a higher price from Bob.  Further negotiation might risk losing him entirely.
* **John's Offer:** While John is also willing to pay $15,000, there's no guarantee that John will still be interested if I reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. It ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids any potential risk of losing both Bob and John."
