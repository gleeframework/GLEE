"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $130? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $130 is a little low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let me know if that works for you.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $135 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay, but I'm willing to go to $132. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",132.0,Bob,4,
