{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point slightly above Bob's valuation, leaving room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $130? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $130 is a little low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $135 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay, but I'm willing to go to $132. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $132 is close to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  It's better to sell to John for $150, which is significantly more than $132 and meets my minimum acceptable price."
