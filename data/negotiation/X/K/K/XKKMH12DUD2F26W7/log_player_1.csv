Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming to get as close to my value of $1,500,000 as possible, but I'm also willing to negotiate. $1,250,000 is a good compromise that is still beneficial to me and leaves room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  It's also lower than the value of the product to him ($1,000,000).  While I'm open to negotiation, I don't want to settle for a price that undervalues my product.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's a significant drop from my initial offer. I'm hoping that this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that is close to my minimum acceptable value."
