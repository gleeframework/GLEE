"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still save money by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is still a good deal for you. You are only $150,000 over your initial goal of $1,000,000, and further negotiation could potentially lead to Alice rejecting your counteroffer and forcing you to buy from John.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
