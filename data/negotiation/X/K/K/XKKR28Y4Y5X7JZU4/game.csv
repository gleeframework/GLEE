"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9000 is simply too low for me. Let's compromise. How about $10500? It's a fair price that's still significantly below what this product is worth.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10000, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10000 is a step in the right direction.  To make this work for me, I need to be at $11000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to go up to $9800, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think that buying from John might be a better option.",9800.0,Bob,6,
