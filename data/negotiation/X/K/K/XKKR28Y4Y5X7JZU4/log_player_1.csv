"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the value is much higher than that.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Framing it positively:**  I'm highlighting the potential benefit for Bob by emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm giving Bob the opportunity to counteroffer,  keeping the negotiation process open. 

**Important note:**  My goal is to maximize my earnings, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000. This gives me leverage throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $9,000 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I have 10 rounds and can still make a counteroffer.  I can potentially close a deal closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  I'm comfortable with the knowledge that I can sell to John at any point for $15,000, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. Let's compromise. How about $10,500? It's a fair price that's still significantly below what this product is worth."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price.
* **Maintaining a high enough price:**  $10,500 is still much closer to my desired price than Bob's offer.
* **Using a persuasive tone:**  I'm framing the price as a ""fair compromise,""  appealing to Bob's sense of reason.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground where I can secure a decent profit without risking the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10000, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **More rounds available:** We are only in Round 4.  I have ample time to continue the negotiation. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not desperate for a sale. I can still sell to John for a significantly higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to try to inch closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not going to settle for anything too far below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,000 is a step in the right direction.  To make this work for me, I need to be at $11,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm inching towards Bob's offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Still above my minimum:** I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I need to be able to make a decent profit.
* **Positive framing:** I'm calling it a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground that benefits both of us.  With each round, I'm adjusting my offer to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to go up to $9800, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think that buying from John might be a better option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,800 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** We're in round 6, meaning only 4 rounds left.  It's unlikely Bob will budge much further.
* **John offers a much better deal:** I can sell to John immediately for $15,000, which is far more profitable than any deal I can get from Bob at this point. 

**Strategy:**

I'm prioritizing profit and securing a sale with a buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob, especially with so few rounds remaining."
