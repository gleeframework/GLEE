"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $22,000 represents the product's true value, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the offer, and for recognizing the value of this product.  I can go as low as $14,000 - this is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $14,000 is closer, my budget really only allows for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise. ",11000.0,Bob,6,
