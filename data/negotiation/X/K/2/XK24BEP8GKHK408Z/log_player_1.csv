Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:** The offer is significantly higher than John's $120, ensuring we prioritize selling to Bob for a better profit.

This strategy aims to secure a sale at a price that benefits both parties while maximizing Alice's profit."
