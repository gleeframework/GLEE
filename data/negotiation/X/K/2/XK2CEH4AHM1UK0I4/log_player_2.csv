"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John. There are still 9 rounds left, so there's ample opportunity to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a strong counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above John's price. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating but also willing to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price and closer to John's price, it's still higher than what Bob wants. There are still 7 rounds left, so Bob can continue to negotiate and hopefully get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still remaining below John's offer. This counteroffer signals a willingness to reach a deal but also emphasizes Bob's desire to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, and it's now only $25,000 higher than John's offer. With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice increases. While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting Alice's offer guarantees a purchase at a price very close to his target, minimizing the risk of losing out on the product."
