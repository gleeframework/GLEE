"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something truly unique and valuable. I'm sure you'll find it a fantastic investment.  My initial price is $1,200,000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $1,050,000?  I believe that's a fair price considering the unique value of this product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, but I still think that's a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. Can you consider that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $950,000 is still a little too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. That's the absolute minimum I can accept for this product. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. Can you consider that price?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $980,000 is still just a little too low. I'm going to have to stick to my last offer of $1,000,000. It's the minimum I can accept, and it's a fair price for this unique product. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to stick to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't accept it.",990000.0,Bob,8,
