"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but it's more in line with my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $900,000 is a strong offer, the value this product brings is truly unique.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise while recognizing its inherent worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has unique value, but I still think $900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can agree on this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to find a middle ground here, but the reality is this product offers significant value beyond that price point. I'm comfortable coming down slightly to $1,025,000. I believe this reflects the true value and potential this product holds. ",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you believe the product has significant value, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,025,000. I'm going to reiterate that I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $950,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm not willing to go any higher, and I'm starting to consider alternative options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
