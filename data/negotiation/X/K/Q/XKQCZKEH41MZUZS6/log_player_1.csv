**Reasoning:**

Bob is firmly rooted at $950,000 and unwilling to budge.  While further counteroffers are possible, it's unlikely we'll bridge the gap to a number that significantly closes in on John's offer of $1,200,000. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed, higher offer from John."
