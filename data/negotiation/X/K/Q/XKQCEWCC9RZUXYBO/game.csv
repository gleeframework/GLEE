"Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's close this quickly, I'm confident you'll find it beneficial.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value your interest, $1,100,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Consider this:  you're getting a unique opportunity to acquire an asset with immense potential, and  $1,150,000 is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product has potential, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go to $1,075,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  This product holds unique potential, and I believe a price closer to $1,125,000 reflects that.  Let's aim for a compromise that's mutually beneficial and allows us to close this deal.  Time is of the essence, and this offer won't last forever.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's try $1,075,000 again, or I can go as high as $1,082,500. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,082,500 simply doesn't cover the value of this opportunity.  I'm willing to make a final concession.  How about $1,100,000?  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal and unlock the potential of this product together.  This offer is valid for the next 2 rounds - after that, I'll need to consider other options.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
