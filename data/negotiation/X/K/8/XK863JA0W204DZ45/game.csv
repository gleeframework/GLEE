"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, however,  $1,100,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't accept $600,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects its worth, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you consider $750,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you and the market demand, I'm willing to make a new counteroffer of $850,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
