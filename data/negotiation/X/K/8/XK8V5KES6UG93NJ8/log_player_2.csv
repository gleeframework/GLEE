{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're only willing to spend $15,000 maximum. 
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  You can try to get a better price from Alice. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.**  This acts as a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still within the range of what you're willing to pay. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** You're not offering your maximum price, allowing for potential compromise.
* **Signals seriousness:** This counteroffer shows Alice you're serious about buying but are not going to pay her asking price."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While closer to your desired price, $18,000 is still above your maximum limit. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** You've already shown Alice you're willing to negotiate, and a further counteroffer might lead to a more acceptable price.
* **John's offer remains a safety net.** If negotiations fail, you can always buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to your limit:**  This offer is only $1,000 below your maximum, showing that you're serious about getting a deal.
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  There's still space for Alice to negotiate a bit without feeling pressured.
* **Increasing pressure:** This counteroffer signals that you're not willing to go much higher, making Alice more likely to accept or counter with a price closer to yours."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** While it's not your ideal price, $16,500 is within your maximum limit of $15,000.
* **Further negotiation is risky.** It's possible that Alice will reject your counteroffer again, forcing you to either pay John's price or walk away empty-handed.
* **Small price difference:** The difference between Alice's offer and your maximum is relatively small, making it worthwhile to accept and avoid further negotiation."
