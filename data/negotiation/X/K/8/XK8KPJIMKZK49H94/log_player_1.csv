This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a compromise between our valuations while still getting a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  I want to see if I can get him to come closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a better middle ground. How about we try $1,025,000? This would still be a good deal for both of us, and it's a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my initial goal, it's now closer to my minimum acceptable price and the negotiation has gone back and forth a few times. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit, while continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle for John's offer."
