"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price for it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a better middle ground. How about we try $1,025,000? This would still be a good deal for both of us, and it's a fair price for me.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
