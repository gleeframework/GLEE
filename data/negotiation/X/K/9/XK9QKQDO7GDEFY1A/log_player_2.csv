{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's much better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have a safety net with John, so there's no rush to accept a bad deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get her closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from my previous counteroffer.  This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not going to budge much further.  It's a calculated risk, but I believe it's a good move to keep the negotiation moving."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I believe I can get a better deal with further negotiation. I'm not going to be impulsive and jump at the first offer that's slightly closer to my desired price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer again, but by a smaller amount this time. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to overpay. I'm hoping that Alice will see this as a sign of good faith and be willing to meet me in the middle."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I believe there's room for a more favorable price.  I still have John as an option if I can't get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm making a final push with this counteroffer. It's a significant increase from my previous offer, but I'm still below Alice's current price. If Alice accepts, I'll be able to secure the product for a price I'm comfortable with. If she rejects, I'll have to decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or just buying from John."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly, and we're only one round away from the option of buying from John. This offer is close enough to my budget that it's worth accepting. There's a chance I could get it lower, but it's not worth risking the deal for a small price difference."
