Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth it at $110. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $110 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price (e.g., $100) while still ensuring you make a significant profit.
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:** Offering a price too close to your minimum ($80) might make Bob undervalue the product or feel like he can get away with a much lower offer.

Remember, this is just one strategy.  You could adjust your offer based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style or how much you want to prioritize a quick sale."
