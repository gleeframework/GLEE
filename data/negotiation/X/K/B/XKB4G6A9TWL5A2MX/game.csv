"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, however, the value of this product for someone like you goes beyond $1,800,000.  I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to make a deal with you.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $2,100,000 price tag. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",2000000.0,Bob,4,
