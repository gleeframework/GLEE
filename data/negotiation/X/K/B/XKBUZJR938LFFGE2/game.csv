"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $12000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and quality.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to get the product and you to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and quality.",11000.0,Alice,5,
