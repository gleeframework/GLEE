"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you mentioned.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your perspective on the price, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher figure. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I still think $925,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you mentioned.",875000.0,Bob,4,
