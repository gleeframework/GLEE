"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident it's worth the investment for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and focuses on the value for Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my minimum ($15,000) to leave room for potential counteroffers and to see if there's any wiggle room in Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob is showing interest, there is still room for negotiation.  I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Time to Counter:** With 9 rounds remaining, I have plenty of time to work towards a more profitable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise given the value this product offers. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Above Minimum:** I'm counteroffering at $10,500, which is still above my minimum but shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" suggesting a meeting point.
* **Emphasize Value:** I subtly remind Bob about the value the product offers, hoping it will sway his decision. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep negotiations open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Continues:** While the gap is narrowing, I'm not yet at a point where I'm willing to accept. I still believe there's room to increase the price.
* **Time on My Side:** With 7 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can squeeze out more profit from Bob. There's a chance I might be able to reach a deal that is closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm offering to meet halfway between my last offer ($10,500) and Bob's last offer ($9,500). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Fair Price:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price, suggesting it reflects the value of the product.
* **Reaching Agreement:**  I'm highlighting the positive outcome of reaching an agreement, which could increase Bob's motivation to accept. 
* **Avoiding John:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I'm still trying to maximize my profit with Bob. The gap is narrowing, and I'm optimistic about reaching a deal closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $10000 is a bit high. How about we meet at $9200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, $9,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 5 rounds left, I need to be strategic. I'm not ready to accept yet, but I also don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer completely. 
* **Counteroffer to Gauge Bob's Flexibility:** I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if there's any more room for negotiation and to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay. 
* **Selling to John is Still an Option:** The possibility of selling to John for $15,000 is still a safety net, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find common ground. To be honest, $9,200 isn't quite there yet for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, so how about $9,600? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 9600}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Halfway Compromise:**  I'm again offering to split the difference between our last offers. This continues to show flexibility and a desire to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Urgency & Finality:** I'm subtly introducing urgency by saying, ""we can finally get this deal done."" This might encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Fair Compromise:**  I continue to frame the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" reinforcing the idea of a win-win situation.
* **Assessing Bob's Interest:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm getting one step closer to my goal of $15,000. It also gives me one more opportunity to see if Bob is genuinely interested in reaching an agreement. 
* **Selling to John Still Possible:** If Bob rejects this offer, selling to John remains a viable option, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9300. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 3 rounds left, the negotiation is becoming increasingly time-sensitive.
* **Close to Minimum:** While $9,300 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit. 
* **Risk of Reaching a Stalemate:**  There's a real risk of ending the negotiation without a deal if I keep rejecting Bob's offers.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a profit that is significantly higher than what I can realistically expect from Bob at this point. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  By selling to John, I ensure a positive outcome without risking further rounds of negotiation that might lead to a worse outcome."
