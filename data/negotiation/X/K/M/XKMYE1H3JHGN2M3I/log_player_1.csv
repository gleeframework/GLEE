"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm hoping to push him towards a counteroffer.  If he rejects, I'll have a better sense of his range and can adjust accordingly.  If he accepts, great!  But I'm always prepared to fall back to John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I want to make a profit, I also want to ensure I get at least what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $9,000.  It's still above my minimum, and I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about making a deal but also signals that I won't settle for his initial low offer.  I'll see if he's willing to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can push him higher.  I'm confident I can get a better price, and I don't want to settle for less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to make one more concession and offer $8,500. This is closer to my minimum and shows I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not going to go lower. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm not going to budge much further and he'll accept this offer. If he rejects, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob finally came up to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, I'm happy to accept his offer.  I've got to be realistic about what's achievable in these negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and having to settle for John's offer."
