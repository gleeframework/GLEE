Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $12,500 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to go a little lower, but $13,500 is my absolute bottom line. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a fantastic value for you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in price, but $13,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to make a final concession and accept $13,250. This is a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my goal.  Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is offering a price that's a good deal below her stated value.  While you could try to haggle further, there's a risk she'll become frustrated and you'll lose the opportunity to buy it for under $13,500.  It's a good idea to accept this offer and secure the deal."
