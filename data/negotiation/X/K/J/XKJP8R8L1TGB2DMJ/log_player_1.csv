"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to Bob, but still lower than its value to me. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob more likely to engage.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to make the offer seem more attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I have 10 rounds and still have room to negotiate with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and hopefully reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer:** While John is a backup option, I'd rather try to negotiate with Bob and see if I can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and makes the counteroffer seem more reasonable.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, highlighting that $14,000 is still a good deal.
* **Urgency:**  I'm using language like ""Let's close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $12,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **More Negotiation Rounds:** I still have 6 rounds left, which allows for further negotiation and potentially a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:** While John offers $15,000, I want to see if I can get closer to that number with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob in the next round.  I'll try to stay close to $14,000 to see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $12,500 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to go a little lower, but $13,500 is my absolute bottom line. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a fantastic value for you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **Bottom Line:**  I'm stating $13,500 as my absolute bottom line. This adds pressure and may encourage Bob to accept.
* **Urgency:**  I'm using language like ""Let's make this happen"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I understand you have a bottom line, and I respect that.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,000? It's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you are. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** I have 4 rounds left.  While time is getting tighter, I believe I can still push for a better price.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm hesitant to sell to John yet because I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob in the next round. I'll try to increase the price slightly, but I may need to make a bigger concession to reach a deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in price, but $13,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to make a final concession and accept $13,250. This is a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my goal.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:**  I'm signaling to Bob that this is my final offer. This adds pressure and could make him more likely to accept.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm still willing to compromise.
* **Urgency:**  I'm using language like ""Let's finalize this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Why $13,250:** This offer allows me to stay above my minimum price while potentially securing a deal with Bob.  I have fewer rounds left, so I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession."
