"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Is that something we can work with?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, the value this product brings justifies a higher price. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $2,000,000? I'm confident this would be a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm not convinced it's worth $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,400,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
