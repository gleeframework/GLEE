""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds tremendous value and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Bob's offer is better than John's, but it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I believe there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, the value this product brings justifies a higher price. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $2,000,000? I'm confident this would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm not convinced it's worth $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,400,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price, and it seems unlikely he'll come up significantly. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
