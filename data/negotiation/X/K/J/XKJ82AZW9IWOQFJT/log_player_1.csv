"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $10,000.  I will counter with a slightly higher offer to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $10,800 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,150. This offer still represents a significant value for you, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10,900. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit below my ideal price, it's only $100 less than my last counteroffer and only $900 less than my initial offer.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by rejecting and then having to sell to John for $10,000."
