Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000.  This price is fair considering the product's value and my willingness to negotiate.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,125,000 is still too expensive for my budget. How about we settle somewhere in the middle again?  I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but  $650,000 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This price takes into consideration both our needs and is a significant step closer to an agreement.  I hope you'll consider this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $900,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $800,000, saving you $100,000.  It's better to take the sure deal than risk Alice not coming down further."
