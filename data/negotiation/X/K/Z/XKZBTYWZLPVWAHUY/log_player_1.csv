Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $145."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $145 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Above Minimum:** The offer is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($120), ensuring a good profit.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or willingness to pay. If you had more insights into Bob's behavior, you might adjust your offer accordingly."
