Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is because I don't know the value of the product to Bob. By starting high, I leave room for negotiation and potentially earn a higher profit.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not risking too much by starting high. 
* **Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate with him. My goal is to get as close to my ideal price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** Bob's offer is still higher than John's offer, so it's worth trying to negotiate further. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, there's potential to earn more by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm reducing my price from $1,500,000 to $1,400,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and see if he's willing to meet me halfway.
* **Staying Above John's Offer:**  By keeping the price above $1,000,000, I'm ensuring that any potential agreement with Bob will be more profitable than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Deal:**  Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away completely.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit greater than selling to John. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing the negotiations could drag on, potentially costing me time and potentially resulting in a lower final price."
