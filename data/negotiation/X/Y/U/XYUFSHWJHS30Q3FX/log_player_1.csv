Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob only values the product at $100, it's best to start with a price closer to your minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation or a surprisingly quick acceptance.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $125 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value, but it's presented as a special deal, potentially making it more appealing. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  It's crucial to remember that you have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John. This knowledge gives you leverage in negotiating with Bob."
