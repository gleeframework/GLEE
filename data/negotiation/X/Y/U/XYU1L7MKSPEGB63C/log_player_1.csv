"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price close to my minimum but still leaving some room for negotiation.  Bob might find this attractive since it's significantly less than my value, and it allows for a smoother back-and-forth. I'm hoping he'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price.  I have 8 rounds left and can still sell to John for $15,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to show some flexibility but still keeping it above Bob's offer.  This should hopefully encourage Bob to meet me halfway. If he doesn't, I'm still in a good position to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I have 6 rounds left and can still sell to John for $15,000. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push Bob to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price again, but this time by a smaller amount. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise but am also serious about getting a price closer to my minimum.  I believe this could be a sweet spot where Bob might accept. If not, I still have 5 rounds left to negotiate or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I have 4 rounds left and can still sell to John for $15,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to squeeze a little more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I'm willing to make a final concession. This offer is still higher than Bob's last offer, but it shows I'm serious about closing a deal.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  With only two rounds left, I don't have time to risk further negotiation.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees I get my desired price and avoids the possibility of ending up with a lower offer."
