"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a starting point for discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,200,000. This reflects a more reasonable compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
