Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,200,000. This reflects a more reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob is unwilling to budge above his valuation and has signaled this is his final offer. It makes no sense to continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000."
