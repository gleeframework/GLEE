"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this incredible opportunity. This product has the potential to be a game-changer for your business, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000, reflecting the value it holds. I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better price from Bob. Selling to John at this point would be a loss for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a specific price point. While I acknowledge your perspective on the market conditions, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. It's a substantial discount from my initial offer, showcasing my commitment to a successful partnership."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1300000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair market value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $1,150,000 is still below my target. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate and can potentially push for a higher price. Selling to John would be a loss at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and understand your position.  While I value our negotiation, $1,150,000 is still not in line with the product's true value.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000. This offers a fair balance between our desired outcomes and ensures a win-win situation.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $1175000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and our negotiation so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,175,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have 4 rounds left and can potentially secure a better deal. Selling to John would mean losing a significant amount of money. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to push for a price closer to $1,250,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to find a price point that works for you. While I appreciate your offer, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This represents a significant concession on my part and ensures a mutually beneficial outcome for both of us.  I'm confident this price will be satisfactory for you and allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1225000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, I need to make a decision. While $1,200,000 is still below my ideal price, it's significantly higher than what John is offering. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower price or even no deal at all.  It's time to close this negotiation."
