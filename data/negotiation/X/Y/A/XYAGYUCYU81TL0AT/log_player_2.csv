"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives you a good opportunity to acquire it. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,000,000. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice to lower the price. There's a chance you might be able to get the product for a better price than from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to your target price, it's still above what you're willing to pay.  Since you're only $50,000 away from your ideal price, it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get Alice to come down a bit more.  There's a chance she might be willing to accept a counteroffer closer to your target."
