"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I have to make a living, and $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we settle at $12,000?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you think $12,000 is a fair compromise, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with that. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
