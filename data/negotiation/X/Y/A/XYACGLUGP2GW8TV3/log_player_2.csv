"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's even above her own valuation of the product. It makes sense to negotiate down, and if that fails, John is a good backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to save money, so starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **But Not Too Low:** Offering something ridiculously low might offend Alice and stall the negotiation. $11,000 is a reasonable starting point considering our $10,000 budget.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** This offer signals that we're willing to negotiate, but we're also prepared to walk away if necessary (and buy from John)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I have to make a living, and $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $14,000 is still above our budget and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation. We can try to push Alice a bit closer to our ideal price before considering John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we settle at $12,000?  That's a fair compromise, I think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):**  We're inching closer to a deal. $12,000 is a midpoint between her previous offer ($14,000) and our previous offer ($11,000). 
* **Staying Firm:** We don't want to concede too much too quickly.  By staying firm around the $12,000 mark, we signal that we're serious but willing to negotiate within reason. 
* **John as Leverage:**  We haven't revealed our backup plan (buying from John). This gives us some leverage if Alice is stubborn, as we have a guaranteed option at $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you think $12,000 is a fair compromise, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with that. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While $13,500 is still above our ideal budget, it's within a reasonable range, and further haggling might be fruitless.
* **""Lowest I Can Go"":**  Alice's statement suggests she's unlikely to budge much further. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time and effort. Sometimes, a good enough deal is better than holding out for the absolute best price."
