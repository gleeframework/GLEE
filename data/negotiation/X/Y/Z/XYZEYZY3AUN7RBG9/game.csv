"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  How about $110? I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tight.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget is tight, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $115. If you're serious about selling, I think this is a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
