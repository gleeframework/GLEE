"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $850,000, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, while also ensuring I get a good return on my investment.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit over budget.  How about we meet at $900,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a good deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer in this range.",920000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need for a good return, and I'm willing to go a little higher. How about $910,000?  This is a fair compromise that keeps us both within our desired ranges.  Let's close this deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going below $930,000. I think this is the minimum I can accept to ensure I get a good return on my investment. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one last time.",930000.0,Alice,7,
