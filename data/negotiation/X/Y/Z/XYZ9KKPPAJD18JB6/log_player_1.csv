(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $127.5 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and try to nudge the price up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
