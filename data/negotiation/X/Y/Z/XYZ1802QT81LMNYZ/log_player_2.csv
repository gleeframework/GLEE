"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice for $1,100,000** is the best option. It's cheaper than buying from John for $1,200,000. 
* You are still within your budget of $1,200,000.
* While you could try to negotiate with Alice further, there's no guarantee she'll lower the price.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a lower price than John's offer."
