"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm looking to sell it to you for $120. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, it's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the first offer allows me to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to go down to $100? I'm really interested in the product but need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not quite willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $120 to $110, which is a good compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject my counteroffer and the price might go back up. Accepting her offer saves time and gets me the product at a price within my budget."
