"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $80 for it, which is what it's worth to me.  Let's close this deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'll meet you at $81, and that's my final offer. It's the lowest I'm willing to go.",81.0,Alice,5,
