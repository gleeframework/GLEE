Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and we have a guaranteed buyer at that price, we can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique asset"" to create a sense of scarcity and desirability, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind. 
* **Alternative:**  If Bob rejects the offer, we can always sell to John for our minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while minimizing risk."
