Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially achieving a good outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $8,000, so I'm rejecting it. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is still slightly above Bob's offer but closer to my minimum value, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
