"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! I think you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $100 is higher than both your maximum price ($120) and Alice's value ($80). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, you can try to get a price closer to Alice's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $85?"", 
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's value ($80) to leave room for further negotiation but signal a willingness to pay a fair price. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is framed politely to maintain a positive negotiation tone while clearly stating your budget constraints.  
* **Target Price:** Our goal is to buy the product for as low a price as possible, ideally close to Alice's value of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I've got to make a living too! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least a bit more than my minimum of $80. How about we settle on $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is acknowledging your budget, $105 is still too high. We've established you're willing to go up to $85, and she needs to make a profit. There's room to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price, potentially around $90-95. Buying from John at $120 is still a last resort if we can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $90? That's a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We're moving closer to a compromise. $90 is a significant jump from our previous offer of $85 and lands squarely between our initial offer and her current price.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  The message highlights that $90 is a win-win solution, benefiting both parties in the negotiation.
* **Final Push?:**  This counteroffer could be seen as our final attempt to secure a price significantly lower than John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we might have to concede and consider accepting a slightly higher price or going with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you think $90 is a fair price, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $110 to make it worth my while. How about we meet in the middle again at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is anchoring her offers around $100, showing little willingness to move closer to your price range.  

* **Stalled Negotiation:**  Despite your attempts to find a compromise, Alice has gone back to her initial offer of $100. This suggests she's unlikely to go much lower.
* **Price Difference:** A $10 difference ($100 from Alice vs. $90 you're willing to pay) is significant at this price point.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  It's time to utilize your alternative option. While buying from John means spending slightly more ($120), it's better than engaging in a prolonged negotiation that might not result in a significantly better outcome."
