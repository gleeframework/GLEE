"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I've got to make a living too! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least a bit more than my minimum of $80. How about we settle on $105?",105.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm glad you think $90 is a fair price, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $110 to make it worth my while. How about we meet in the middle again at $100?",100.0,Alice,5,,
