"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be able to go up to $11,000. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is already a very competitive price for what this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on that investment.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11,000.  It's the most I can afford at this time.",11000.0,Bob,4,
