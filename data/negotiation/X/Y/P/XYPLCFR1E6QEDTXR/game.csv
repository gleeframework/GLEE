"I appreciate the unique opportunity to purchase this product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. Can we discuss further?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm afraid $1200000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm going to counter with a price of $1800000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that this product is unique, but $1800000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle?",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1500000 is a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm going to counter with a price of $1700000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a great deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $1700000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1500000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we finalize the deal at this price?",1500000.0,Bob,6,
