"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $1350000?  This is a good middle ground and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to propose an alternative: $1250000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point. $1250000 is closer to my bottom line, but I'm still hoping to secure a bit more.  How about we compromise at $1300000? This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
