"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $135, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $135 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $145?  I really want to make this deal work for both of us.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. $145 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. Let's meet at $140. This is my final offer, as I'm ready to go with John's deal if we can't reach an agreement.",140.0,Bob,6,
