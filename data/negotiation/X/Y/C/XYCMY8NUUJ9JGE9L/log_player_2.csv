{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  It's still well above Alice's value for the product, leaving room for her to counter while still ensuring a good deal for Bob."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting her offer, we can push for a price closer to our desired range and avoid paying a significant premium."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small increase from our previous offer, showing we're serious about negotiating.  It's still a good deal for both parties and leaves room for Alice to counter if needed.  We're getting closer to a potential agreement, but it's important to remain firm and not accept a price too quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than the price from John, and it's within Bob's budget. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and the possibility of buying from John at a much higher price makes accepting this offer the best choice in this round."
