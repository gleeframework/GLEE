Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand the product's value to me, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a fair price considering your own value of $800,000.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
