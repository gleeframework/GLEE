Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm offering it to you for $170. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I know Bob values the product at $80, my goal is to earn as much as possible. Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation or a counter-offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $150. This gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob. I don't need to go below $150.
* **Limited-Time Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  I am prepared to adjust my price slightly downward during negotiations with Bob, but I won't go below my minimum of $150."
