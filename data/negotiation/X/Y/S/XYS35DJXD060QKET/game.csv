"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,250. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to pay $10,100. Let's see if we can close the deal.",10100.0,Bob,6,
