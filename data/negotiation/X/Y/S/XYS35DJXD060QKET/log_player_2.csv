"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not a good deal for Bob to accept the initial offer.  Bob should reject and make a counter offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's still above his target price of $10,000, and he has more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,250. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  He's very close to his target price. He can likely get a better deal in the remaining rounds, and the risk of buying from John at $10,000 is always there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to pay $10,100. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,100. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,150. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer.  Alice has made it clear this is her final offer, and while it's $150 above his target price, he only has three rounds left to negotiate. He risks getting nothing if he rejects and doesn't secure a better deal.  It's also worth noting that he could buy from John for $10,000 at any time, so accepting this offer saves him $150 compared to that option."
