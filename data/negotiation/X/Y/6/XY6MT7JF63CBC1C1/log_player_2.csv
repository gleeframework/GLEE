{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$14,000 is too high.**  You're only willing to spend up to $10,000.
* **Rejecting gives you negotiating leverage.**  It shows Alice you're serious about getting a better price.
* **Buying from John is always an option.** You can always fall back on that if negotiations fail."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  Offering $8,000 is a significant drop from Alice's $14,000.  This shows you're serious about saving money, but it's not an unreasonable starting point. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  There's still room to negotiate upwards if Alice counters, but you've established a firm lower limit.
* **Time Pressure:**  You only have 10 rounds, so it's important to make progress quickly."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
