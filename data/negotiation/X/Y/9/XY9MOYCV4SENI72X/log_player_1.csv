Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for $120 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below my minimum acceptable price and offers a small saving for Bob. 
* **Psychology:** By phrasing it as a ""great deal,"" I nudge Bob towards seeing the value in accepting. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing potential profit."
