"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $145. I believe this price reflects the value it brings to you and is a fair deal considering its worth to me. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, so paying $145 is not ideal. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $145 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product, which is still a good value for you considering your asking price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value of the product and my position, I am unable to accept $130. How about we meet in the middle at $135? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $135 is still a bit more than Bob wants to pay, but it's getting closer to his target of $120. It's likely that further negotiation will only result in a slightly lower price, and it's possible Alice will reject any further counteroffers.  Therefore, accepting the offer is the best option for Bob to secure the product without risking losing it to further negotiations."
