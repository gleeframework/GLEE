"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You can get the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to see if Alice will lower her price to try and make a deal."
