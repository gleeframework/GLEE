{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000, aiming for a good profit margin.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to create a sense of urgency and interest.
* **Open-ended Question:** The open-ended question encourages Bob to engage in conversation and reveal potential interest. 

**Note:**  I'm not going for the highest possible price right away because it risks immediate rejection. This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and adjust my offers in later rounds."

* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting this offer, I can potentially push Bob higher.
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, I'm willing to take a calculated risk to see if I can secure a better price with Bob.

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is very close to my target price of $1,650,000.
