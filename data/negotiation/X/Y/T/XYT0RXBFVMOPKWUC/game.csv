"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I can't let this go for less than $1,300,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay for this product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
