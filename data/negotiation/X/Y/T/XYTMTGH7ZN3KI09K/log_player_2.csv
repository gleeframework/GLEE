"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($80).  This means there's room for negotiation to get a better price.  There's a good chance Alice will accept a lower counteroffer, allowing Bob to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** Alice has lowered her price from $100 to $95, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Your Value:** The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly lower than that. 
* **Potential Risk:** While you could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be stuck paying John's higher price.

Accepting Alice's offer at $95 is a good deal for you, saving you $25 compared to buying from John."
