"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $12,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",12800.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,200. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $12,600. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000.",12600.0,Alice,5,
