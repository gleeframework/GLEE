Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, giving me room to negotiate. If Bob accepts, great! If not, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or try to push for a higher price. Remember, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can likely get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. Hopefully, this shows good faith and encourages him to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $6,500 is too low. It's far below my minimum and I don't think I can get him to increase his offer much further.  While I'd prefer to make more money, I'm confident selling to John for $8,000 is the best move to ensure I don't lose out on a substantial amount."
