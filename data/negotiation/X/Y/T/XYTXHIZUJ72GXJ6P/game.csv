"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? It's a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget constraints.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
