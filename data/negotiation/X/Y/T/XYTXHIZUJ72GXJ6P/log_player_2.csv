"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,200,000. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price.  You can always go with John for $1,500,000 as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? It's a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,280,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is within your budget and a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your counteroffer, and you might end up buying from John at a higher price."
