{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product. It's a game-changer, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1200000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe the product is worth more than $900,000. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob.  I'm also considering selling to John, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm willing to be flexible, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to work with you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $1000000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $950000, which is a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $950,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial target.  I believe the product's value to Bob justifies a slightly higher price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
