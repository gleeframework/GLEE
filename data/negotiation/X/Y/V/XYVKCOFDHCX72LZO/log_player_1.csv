Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too pricey for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $80 is quite a bit lower than my minimum price.  I'm willing to go down to $125.  Let's find a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, it's still a better deal than selling to John for $150. It's important to find a middle ground and ensure a win-win situation, even if it means a slightly lower profit."
