Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price ($1,450,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob. 
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** While you know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, starting too high might discourage him entirely. This offer leaves room for negotiation if needed. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
