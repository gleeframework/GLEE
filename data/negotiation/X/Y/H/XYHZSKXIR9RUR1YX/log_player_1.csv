{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is above my minimum of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product, which might encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer.  $9,000 is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value, but I have a strict budget. Could we settle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than selling to John and gets me closer to my desired profit margin.  Further negotiation might not yield a much higher price, and it's important to consider the potential for a deal falling apart."
