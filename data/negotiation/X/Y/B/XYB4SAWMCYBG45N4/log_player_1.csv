Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $18,000."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price higher than John's offer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer doesn't have to be the final price. If Bob counters, there's space to negotiate down while still aiming for a price above $15,000.
* **Create a Sense of Exclusivity:**  By framing it as a pre-public offer, it might make Bob more inclined to consider it seriously.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves some risk. If Bob outright rejects the initial offer without counter-offering, you might miss out on a price higher than $15,000. However, it aims to maximize your potential profit."
