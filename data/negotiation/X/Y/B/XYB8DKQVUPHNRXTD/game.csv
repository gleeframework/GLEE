"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm confident you'll love the product and I think it's a fair price.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go below $140. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we try $137.50? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to compromise.",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to compromise, but $137.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer. Would you be willing to consider a price of $132.50?",132.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll counter with $135 again. I'm trying to find a sweet spot where we can both be happy with the price. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $130, but no higher. Would you be willing to consider this price?",130.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $130, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from that. How about $137.50? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",137.5,Alice,9,
