"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $90 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $90. Would you be willing to consider $92? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $92 is still just a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $94 as a final offer. This is a great deal for both of us, so let's make it happen.",94.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable going above $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $91? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",91.0,Bob,6,
