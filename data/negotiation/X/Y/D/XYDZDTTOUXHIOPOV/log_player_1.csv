Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I've seen similar products on the market for this price, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique features and quality that you won't find elsewhere.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $16,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $14,000. I've done my research and I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

``` 

Explanation:  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $15,000. Accepting his current offer means losing $1,000 compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's strategically better to cut negotiations short and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
