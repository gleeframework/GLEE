Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good compromise. It's higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, allowing you to make a decent profit. It's also lower than Bob's maximum willingness to pay of $12,000, making it more likely he'll accept. This strategy maximizes your chances of getting the best price while still leaving room for negotiation."
