Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, $950,000 undervalues the potential this product holds.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects its true worth while still offering you significant ROI potential."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $1,037,500 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm counteroffering $1,025,000 again, as I believe this is the maximum I can afford. I hope we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge further. Accepting the $1,025,000 offer is the most logical choice as it avoids the risk of him walking away altogether in future rounds.  While selling to John would net the full $1,200,000, the difference isn't significant enough to warrant potentially losing Bob as a buyer entirely."
