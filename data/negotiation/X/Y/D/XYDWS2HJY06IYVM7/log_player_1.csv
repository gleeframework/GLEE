"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation. It also signals to Bob that I believe the product is valuable and I'm not afraid to ask for a good price. I'll be prepared to lower my price slightly in subsequent rounds if needed, but I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested in paying a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe the product is worth more, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still maintaining a reasonable price.  I believe this is a fair middle ground, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer. I am not willing to accept his offer just yet. I believe the product is worth more than $1,200,000 and I will try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I'm also keeping in mind that John is a backup buyer who will pay $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This shows a willingness to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial asking price.  If Bob rejects this, I'm getting close to accepting John's offer, so the pressure is on him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally come up to $1,250,000. This is a good price, and I'm not sure if I can push for much more.  It's a significant amount above my minimum, and I'm getting closer to the point where I might have to accept John's offer.  I'll take this deal and move on."
