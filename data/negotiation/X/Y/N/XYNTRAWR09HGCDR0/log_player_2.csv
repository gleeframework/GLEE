"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial.  I'm asking for $1,600,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You are only willing to spend $1,200,000, and Alice is asking for $1,600,000.  It's better to reject her offer and purchase the product from John for your maximum price."
