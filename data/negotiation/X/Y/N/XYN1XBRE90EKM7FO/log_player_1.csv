Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. I believe it's worth significantly more than that, but I want to give you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $100 leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a higher profit than selling to John for $80. This price also provides a perceived discount for Bob, making it more enticing for him to accept."
