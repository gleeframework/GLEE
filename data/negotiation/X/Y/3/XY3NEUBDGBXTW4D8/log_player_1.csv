Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000.  Let me know if you'd like to proceed."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. A significantly higher initial offer (in this case, $400,000 above your minimum) leaves room for negotiation while still being within a potentially acceptable range for a product worth that much to him.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" Framing:**  This language adds a sense of value and urgency, potentially making Bob more inclined to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message doesn't sound like an ultimatum. It implies willingness to discuss further if Bob has concerns, allowing you to gauge his interest and adjust if needed.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk that a very high offer might put Bob off completely. However, this strategy aims to maximize potential profit while having a safety net in John's offer."
