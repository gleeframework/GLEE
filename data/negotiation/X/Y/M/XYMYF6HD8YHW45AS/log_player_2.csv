"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
