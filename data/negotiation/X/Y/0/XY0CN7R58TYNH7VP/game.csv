"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering me. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $85. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $100. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $100 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  Let's split the difference.  How about $92.50? It's a fair compromise, and I'm really hoping to make this work.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $92.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $92.50, which would be $96.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",96.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $96.5 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90. This would be a fair price for both of us, as I'm sure you'd be happy to sell it at this price and I would be happy to buy it.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $90. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $95. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good compromise.",95.0,Alice,7,
