Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

I'm counteroffering at $8,500.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for profit. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. Even though it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to settle for less than $8,000 yet. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm running out of rounds. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $8,000."
