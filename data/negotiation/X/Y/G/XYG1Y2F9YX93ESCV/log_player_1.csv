"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below the product's worth to Bob ($15,000) and my minimum ($12,000). There are still rounds left, and I can try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $13000 again, but I'm willing to throw in an additional $500 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is a slight improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and far from the product's worth to him ($15,000).  I'm not willing to settle for this price when I have a guaranteed buyer in John. However, I'm not giving up yet.  There are still rounds left, and I can try to negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,500 is the lowest I can go.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's not waste any more time.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $13500 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $13250 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,250 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's also closer to my desired price of $13,500. There are only a few rounds left, and it's unlikely I'll get a better offer from Bob.  Accepting this offer is the best course of action."
