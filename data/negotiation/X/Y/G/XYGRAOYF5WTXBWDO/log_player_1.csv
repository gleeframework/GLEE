"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the [product description], but I'm only willing to pay $150.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the [product description]. While $150 is your bottom line, I can't go that low. How about $175? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $175, but I'm still not quite there.  $160 is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 
While $160 is not ideal, it's above your minimum and still a reasonable price.  It's better than selling to John at $150, and the negotiation may not go further."
