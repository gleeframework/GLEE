"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with his maximum budget. This is a bold move, but it establishes a clear boundary and forces Alice to decide if she's willing to sell at a significant loss.  If Alice rejects, Bob can gauge her willingness to negotiate and adjust his counteroffers accordingly in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still significantly higher. Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to walk away, and with 7 rounds left, he has time to see if Alice will come closer to his target price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows Bob to continue exploring better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing Alice that he is willing to compromise but still holding firm to his budget. This is a strategic move to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially find a middle ground. If Alice rejects, Bob can adjust his counteroffer again in the next round, potentially pushing her closer to his desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still over his budget. Bob is aiming for a price closer to $8,000 and can still afford to reject this offer and try for a lower price. With 5 rounds remaining, Bob has time to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing Alice that he's willing to compromise while still trying to stay within his budget.  This approach keeps the negotiation moving and keeps pressure on Alice to potentially meet him in the middle.  With only 4 rounds left, Bob needs to start getting closer to his target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is only $2,000 over Bob's budget, he's still hoping for a better deal.  He has 3 rounds left, and with Alice's previous offer, he knows she's willing to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows Bob to potentially get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his budget. This counteroffer shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product and is willing to pay a premium, but it's also a clear signal that he won't go much higher.  With only two rounds left, Bob needs to make a significant move to potentially close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round. Bob has two options:

1. **Accept Alice's offer:** This is a good deal for Bob.  He's only paying $1,900 over his target price.
2. **Reject and buy from John:** This would get Bob the product for his target price, but it would mean losing the opportunity for a slightly better deal with Alice.

Since Bob is close to his budget and wants to secure the product, it's best to accept Alice's offer and finalize the deal."
