"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,600,000. I know this is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. This is a one-time opportunity, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who's ready to pay my minimum asking price of $1,500,000.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
