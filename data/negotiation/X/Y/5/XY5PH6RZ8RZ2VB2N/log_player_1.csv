{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:**  This ensures you don't lose money.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer.

By starting with this offer, you're setting the stage for a successful negotiation. You're showing Bob that you're serious about selling, but you're not desperate. This will encourage him to counteroffer and continue the negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.  It's worth exploring if I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
