Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a larger portion of the potential surplus. 
* **Fairness:**  $950,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,000,000. It allows room for negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware that John is willing to buy for $800,000, so I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding Losses:** Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me a profit, but I'm aiming for a higher price.  

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as you value the product at $1,000,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that my offer is still a good deal.
* **Finding Common Ground:** I'm aiming for a mutually acceptable solution to avoid a stalemate or resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $775,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and puts us closer to a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:** While $775,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it's still not high enough. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Further Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for a slight increase from Bob.  A counteroffer might lead to a deal that's more favorable to me.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John would be the safe option, but I'm not willing to give up on potentially earning more.  

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $775,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit off.  How about we settle at $825,000? This would be a fair compromise that's beneficial for both of us.  Let's close this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** I'm making a final push with a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price but still within a reasonable range for Bob.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm highlighting the offer as a compromise to emphasize that I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting closing the deal and making it happen. This might encourage Bob to accept, especially if he values the product.

I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal. However, I'm still prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to come up a bit more. How about $800,000?  That's a very strong offer and shows how serious I am about buying this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price Achieved:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No Further Gains:**  There's no guarantee I can get a higher price in further negotiations. Bob might become less willing to increase his offer.
* **Secure the Deal:** Accepting this offer secures a guaranteed sale and prevents the risk of Bob backing out or the negotiation dragging on. 

Even though I'd love to get more, it's best to accept this offer and secure a good deal for myself."
