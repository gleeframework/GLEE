,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as you value the product at $1,000,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $775,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit off.  How about we settle at $825,000? This would be a fair compromise that's beneficial for both of us.  Let's close this deal and make it happen.",825000.0,Alice,5,
