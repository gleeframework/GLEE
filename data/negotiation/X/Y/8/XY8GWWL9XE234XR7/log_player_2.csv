Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,800,000. This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. It seems like we're looking at this from two different perspectives. To be transparent, I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000. However, I value our discussions and believe this product can truly benefit you.
