"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's high value. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The $1,150,000 price is closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), making it more likely he'll engage in negotiations rather than walking away immediately. 
* **Backup Plan:**  The offer acknowledges the $1,000,000 offer from John implicitly by not going below that threshold. It keeps the option open to switch to John if negotiations with Bob are unsuccessful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach a satisfactory agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is still significantly below his perceived value of the product. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and it's unlikely Bob will walk away from a deal that's still potentially profitable for him.  We'll try to steer the price closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,120,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  We're coming down from our initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** We're highlighting the product's value again and positioning the lower price as a significant concession.
* **Incremental Approach:**  The counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation. We're aiming for a win-win, not a complete surrender."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the value I perceive in the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I hope this proposal helps us move closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress! Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more than his initial counteroffer. We're still in a strong negotiating position.  With six rounds remaining, we have the time to nudge him higher. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Bob and signals that we're not desperate to close at any price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show my commitment to making this deal happen, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This is my final offer. I believe it represents a fair and reasonable price for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to take this offer seriously. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** We've made a significant concession from our initial offer, moving almost to the midpoint between our starting points.
* **Justification:**  We're reiterating the product's value to justify the price.
* **Time Constraint:** While we have rounds remaining, presenting this as our ""best and final"" offer might push Bob to make a decision without dragging out negotiations further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility. In light of our ongoing negotiations, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,085,000. I hope this proposal will facilitate a successful conclusion to our discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal. Here's why:

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,085,000 is a significant amount over our minimum price and a good return on the product's value to us.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher offer, but the potential gain is likely small compared to the risk of Bob walking away or stalling indefinitely. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows us to reinvest the capital sooner, potentially leading to further gains. 
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting this offer shows Bob we're willing to compromise and fosters goodwill for potential future dealings."
