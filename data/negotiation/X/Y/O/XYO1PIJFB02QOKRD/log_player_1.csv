I'm starting with my ideal price, as I know John is willing to pay this amount. It's possible Bob will reject this, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and we can finalize the deal."
