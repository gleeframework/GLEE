# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a million to you for a slightly higher price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800000 is simply too far below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my initial asking price. How about $1000000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer is still a bit too high for me. I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to push the price down a bit more. I'll offer $900,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Alice's new offer.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $900,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
