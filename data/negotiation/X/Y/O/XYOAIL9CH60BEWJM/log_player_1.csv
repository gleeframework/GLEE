Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to commit to the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation so far.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $910,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $910,000 makes sense at this stage. Bob is consistently meeting me halfway, and we're getting close to a point where further haggling might be counterproductive.  It's a strong offer exceeding my minimum, and a sure thing compared to continuing the negotiation."
