"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle â€“ how about $19,000? I'm confident you'll see a considerable return on this investment.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $19,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to you.  Let's make a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is closer, but still below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $15,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle again -  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and we could finalise the deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
