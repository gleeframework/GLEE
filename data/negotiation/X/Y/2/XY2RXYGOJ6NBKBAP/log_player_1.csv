Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but not so high that it makes it likely Bob will reject the offer out of hand.  If he rejects it, I can still sell to John for $80, so I'm not taking much risk."
