Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.,1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's unique value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to make one more compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1050000 is still too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
