Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $145. I believe it's of great value and would benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so offering it below this price creates a potential gain for him.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Starting with a price close to Bob's maximum valuation increases the chance of a sale at a high profit margin for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $120 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice still secures a sale. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring Alice doesn't miss out on a sale entirely."
