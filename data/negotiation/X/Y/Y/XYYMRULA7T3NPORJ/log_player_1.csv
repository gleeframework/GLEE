Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable insight into his level of interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Fallback Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob rejects your initial offer."
