"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll offer you the product for $180. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
