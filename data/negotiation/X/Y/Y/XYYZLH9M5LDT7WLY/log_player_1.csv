{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit above my budget. I'm happy to pay $115 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  While $115 is better than nothing, I can likely get closer to my minimum price of $120 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher. How about $125? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, $120 is my minimum acceptable amount, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate."
