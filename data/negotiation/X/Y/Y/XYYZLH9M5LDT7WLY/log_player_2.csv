"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $130 is above Bob's maximum price of $120.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit above my budget. I'm happy to pay $115 for the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer than his maximum price of $120 to leave room for negotiation.  This counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but also signals his willingness to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher. How about $125? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $125 is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still above his desired price point.  Since Bob has 7 rounds left, he can try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again could lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy right now."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering his maximum price, but framing it as a compromise to make it more appealing to Alice.  He also emphasizes his willingness to buy immediately, hoping to encourage Alice to accept."
