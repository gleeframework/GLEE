{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving you room to negotiate downwards. It also acknowledges the value to Bob, potentially making him more willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $900,000 is more than what John is offering, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves a significant margin for you. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While $950,000 is tempting, it's still below my desired price. I'll counteroffer one more time to see if we can find a middle ground."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $975,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $925,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer and meet you halfway again.

Bob is not willing to budge further, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. It's better to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
