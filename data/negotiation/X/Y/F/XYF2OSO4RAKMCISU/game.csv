"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $7500. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12000.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $8250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you is $12000.",8250.0,Alice,5,
