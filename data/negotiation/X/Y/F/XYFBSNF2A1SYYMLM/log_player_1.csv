Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations for the sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer matches John's, I know the product's intrinsic value is much higher. It's clear Bob won't reach a price that reflects this. Selling to John ensures I get the minimum acceptable price while leaving open the possibility of a better deal later."
