"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I understand the value, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I could potentially do $950,000.  Would that work for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'll make a new counteroffer: $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
