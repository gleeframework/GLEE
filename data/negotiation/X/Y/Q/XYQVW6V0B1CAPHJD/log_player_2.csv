You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. This is my best counteroffer for now.

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. He should continue negotiating to try and get closer to his target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to increase your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $12,000, which is $10,750. This is my best counteroffer so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:

While $10,750 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. He should try to negotiate further to see if Alice will budge closer to his desired price.  There is a good chance he can get a better deal, but he needs to be prepared to walk away if necessary."
