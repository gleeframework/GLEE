"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $8,000.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. This is my best counteroffer for now.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to increase your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $12,000, which is $10,750. This is my best counteroffer so far.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,750 is still a bit more than I'm able to spend right now. I'm willing to offer $10,000, which is a fair compromise and closer to my budget. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider my other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
