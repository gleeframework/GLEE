# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $775,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $825,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $825,000 is a reasonable compromise and secures a significant saving compared to buying from John."
