"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $775,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $825,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
