"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth negotiating with Alice.  $1,200,000 is still a significant amount above her value of $800,000, giving room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still too high. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,000,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and hopefully Alice will see it as a good deal considering her value for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd love to get it for $1,000,000, $1,050,000 is a good deal. I've saved over $450,000 compared to buying from John."
