Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $81 and $78. How about we try $79.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference is becoming very small. It's better to secure the deal at $79.50 rather than risk her raising the price again or running out of rounds and having to buy from John for $100."
