"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $140?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
