"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price.  However, $12000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $13000.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my initial offer and still gives me a reasonable profit. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
