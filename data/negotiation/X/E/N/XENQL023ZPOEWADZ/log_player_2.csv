"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your desired price point. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can bring the price down.  You have room to negotiate since you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your offer, the value of this product is quite significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, but not to $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your target of saving as much money as possible.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer gives you another chance to negotiate.  You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, so there's still room to find a price that works for both of you."
