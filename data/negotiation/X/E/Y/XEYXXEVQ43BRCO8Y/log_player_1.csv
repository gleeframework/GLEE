Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a good starting point.** It's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, giving him room to negotiate. It's also below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, giving you some wiggle room.
* **The message is friendly and positive.**  It emphasizes the value of the product and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started while setting a strong initial position. I'm willing to go down slightly, but not too much, to ensure I get a fair price. I'm also prepared to walk away if the negotiation drags on or Bob becomes too unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it's closer to my ideal price, I'm not willing to settle for such a low amount. I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob, and I'm not afraid to walk away if necessary. 

By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a mutually acceptable price. I'll aim for a price closer to $10,000, but I'll be prepared to adjust my offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to a fair price for me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob, reminding him that $9,500 is still a good deal.
* **Call to Action:** I'm asking for a response, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation. 

I believe this counteroffer is fair and reasonable.  If Bob rejects it, I'll consider selling to John, but I'm hopeful we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me. How about $9000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Considering that I can always sell to John for $12,000, accepting Bob's offer makes sense in this situation. 

Here's why:

* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price. 
* **Time Factor:** Spending more time negotiating might not be worth the potential increase in price.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Bob might decide to walk away if I reject his offer again, leaving me with no deal and potentially no sale to John either.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that's fairly close to my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
