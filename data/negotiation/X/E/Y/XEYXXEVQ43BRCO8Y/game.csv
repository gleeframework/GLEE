"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to a fair price for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me. How about $9000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.",9000.0,Bob,4,
