"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $95. This is a great opportunity to own something worth $100 at a reasonable discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While the product is worth $100 to you, $95 is still too close to your maximum price. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation. You can counteroffer and try to get a lower price. 
* **John is a backup option:**  Having John as a backup seller gives you leverage in negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:**  You're starting the negotiation by making a significant counteroffer. This shows Alice that you're serious about getting a good price.
* **Targeting the middle:** Offering $85 is a middle ground between your maximum price ($100) and Alice's minimum price ($80). 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  You're still leaving room for negotiation, and you have the option of going to John if Alice is unwilling to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a more attractive offer. Considering the value of the product and your willingness to pay, I am willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:**  While Alice has come down from $95 to $90, it's still too close to your maximum price.
* **Room for further negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation, especially considering you have John as a backup option.
* **Test Alice's willingness to compromise:** Rejecting this offer again will demonstrate your commitment to getting a lower price and might push Alice to make a more significant concession."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $87.50 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my willingness to buy it from you."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:**  By offering $87.50, you're demonstrating that you're serious about negotiating, but also showing that you're willing to move closer to Alice's price. This makes it more likely she'll accept.
* **Middle ground:**  $87.50 is still a good deal for you and only slightly higher than your previous counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining pressure:**  You're still leaving room for negotiation and reminding Alice that John is waiting in the wings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground here. Considering the value of the product and your willingness to pay, I am willing to sell it to you for $89. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $89 is a good price for you, considering your maximum price of $100. 
* **Limited room for further negotiation:** While you could try to get a lower price, it's unlikely Alice will come down further.
* **Avoiding John:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $11 compared to buying from John.

**Conclusion:**

At this point, it's a good strategy to accept Alice's offer. You've successfully negotiated a lower price and secured the product."
