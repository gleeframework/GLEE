"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. How about we settle on $160? It's a fair compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I'm willing to sweeten the pot by throwing in some additional perks.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better price, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm getting closer to my target, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $155. It's a bit higher than your latest offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",155.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your latest offer and my previous offer, so I'll offer $145 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",145.0,Bob,6,
