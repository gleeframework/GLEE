I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's also a high enough number that it's likely Bob will counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate a price that is more beneficial for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to sell for $1,200,000, I want to see if I can get a better price from him.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still gives me a decent profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a decent price, and higher than what John is offering. It's worth accepting this offer to secure the sale."
