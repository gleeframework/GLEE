Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm Alice. I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe would be a great asset to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'm not willing to settle for less than $2,000,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than that. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering the benefits it offers."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,900,000 is a more reasonable offer. I'd like to discuss further and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, but I'm still not willing to settle. I'll aim a bit higher and see if I can get him closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,900,000 is close, but to make this work on my end, I'd need to see $1,975,000.  I believe that reflects the value of the product while recognizing your position."",
""product_price"": 1975000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I think $1,850,000 is as low as I'm willing to go. I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle again, but I'm not willing to go any higher than this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is unlikely to budge much higher, and while I'd prefer to get closer to $2,000,000, securing $1,850,000 is a good outcome at this point. It's better to accept a strong offer now than risk losing the deal by pushing too hard."
