Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000.  Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $14,000 is a strong starting point, it leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Secure a Quick Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower than Bob's perceived value might make him hesitant, thinking there's something wrong with the product. A strong but fair offer encourages a quicker decision.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, maximizing Alice's profit. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has the safety net of selling to John for her minimum acceptable price."
