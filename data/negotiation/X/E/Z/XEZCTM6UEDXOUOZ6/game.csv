"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can we meet in the middle at $10,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,250 is still too far from what I can accept. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $9,500, which would be $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",10000.0,Bob,6,
