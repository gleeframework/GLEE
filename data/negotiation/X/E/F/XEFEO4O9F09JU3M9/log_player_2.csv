# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Alice is unlikely to go any lower and it's better to secure the $1,200,000 deal with John than risk Alice sticking to her price."
