"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that we're close to reaching an agreement, but I'm not willing to go up to $980000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1030000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",1030000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal, but I'm still thinking $980000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stick to my budget. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at $980000.",980000.0,Bob,6,
