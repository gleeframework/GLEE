,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $110 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $115, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $112. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $112 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $113? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd rather sell it to you than someone else.",113.0,Alice,5,
