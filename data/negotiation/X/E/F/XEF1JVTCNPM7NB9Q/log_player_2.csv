"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to your business. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $900,000.  This gives you a significant profit margin and allows me to achieve a strong return on my investment. Let's talk about this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $900,000
* **Your value:** $1,000,000
* **John's price:** $1,000,000

Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John will cost you $1,000,000, but it's still cheaper than accepting Alice's offer. You can save $100,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
