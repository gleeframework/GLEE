I'm starting with my desired price of $1,000,000.  This sets the stage for negotiation, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John for the same amount. This gives me leverage and shows Bob that I'm serious about getting my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close, but I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price of $1,000,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a compromise from my initial price, but still above Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs, and hopefully, it will convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for $975,000, his counteroffer is getting too low. My minimum value for this product is $1,000,000 and selling to John ensures I get that.  It's time to secure the deal with John."
