"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate you working with me on this. While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to my budget. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'd like to counteroffer at $800,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
