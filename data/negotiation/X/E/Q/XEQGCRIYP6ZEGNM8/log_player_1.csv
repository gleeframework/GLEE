{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It also acknowledges the potential value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial price.  I'm confident that I can secure a higher price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This would still give you a good deal considering the value of the product to you, and it's closer to my initial offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
