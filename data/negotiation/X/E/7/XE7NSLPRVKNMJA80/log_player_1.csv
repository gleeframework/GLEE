Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $150 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price that is slightly higher than what it's worth to him, but still reasonable.

{""product_price"": $130}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $115 is lower than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($150), I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $115, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that, but still lower than my minimum price of $150.

{""product_price"": $125}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle and accept this offer!"
