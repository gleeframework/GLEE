Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit lower than my minimum of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be enticed by the price and accept the offer. If he doesn't, I'll be ready to counter-offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I need to make at least $15,000 for the product. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This would give us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's a bit higher than Bob's offer but still gives him a good price. I hope this will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price with Bob, $11,250 is still not enough. It's tempting to accept as it's a bit closer to my minimum, but I believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and make one more counteroffer.  If he rejects that, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great price, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $11,750. This is the very best I can do. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

This is my final counteroffer. It's a bit closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. If he rejects this, I will sell to John for $15,000."
