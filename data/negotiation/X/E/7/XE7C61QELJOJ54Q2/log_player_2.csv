"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much more than your budget and what John is offering. You should definitely make a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Expressing Interest:** It's important to show Alice you're still interested in the product, encouraging her to continue the negotiation.
* **Setting a Target:** This counteroffer aims closer to your ideal price range, keeping in mind your $12,000 fallback option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit too. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's still above your fallback option of buying from John for $12,000. There's room for further negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're willing to walk away unless she gets closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal right now if you agree."", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to split the difference between Alice's current offer ($13,000) and your previous offer ($10,000). This shows willingness to compromise while still moving towards a favorable price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating you're ""ready to close the deal right now,"" you add a bit of pressure and signal that this is a serious offer. 
* **Staying Above John's Price:** This counteroffer still keeps you below your fallback option of buying from John, ensuring you're getting a better deal if Alice accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I can offer the product to you for $12,200. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very close to your budget but still not quite there.  At this point, the potential savings of another round of negotiation aren't worth the risk of Alice raising her price or the time it will take. You can get the product for a sure $12,000 from John, which is a good outcome."
