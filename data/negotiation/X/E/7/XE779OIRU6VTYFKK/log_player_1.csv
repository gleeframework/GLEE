Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount due to its unique value proposition.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing specifics, encouraging Bob to consider the higher price. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer will help you gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, a significantly higher offer might discourage Bob entirely. Be prepared to negotiate if necessary."
