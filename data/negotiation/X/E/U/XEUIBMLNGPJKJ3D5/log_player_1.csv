Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $120 for it."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Aiming for Surplus:** While Bob values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay slightly more if he perceives its value to be higher or if it's something he really wants. 
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to accept an offer below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price ($100). You have the leverage to negotiate further, knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my asking price. How about $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By decreasing the price by $10, you're signaling a willingness to negotiate while still staying above your minimum.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You're not dropping to $100 (John's offer) yet. This keeps the pressure on Bob and demonstrates the value you place on the product. 
* **Gauging Bob's Seriousness:** This counteroffer will help you understand how interested Bob really is and if there's room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $100? That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Your Minimum:** Bob's offer now matches your minimum acceptable price ($100). There's no further room for negotiation without going below your threshold.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a better outcome and could take more time and effort. Accepting now secures the sale. 
* **Matching John's Offer:**  While you could sell to John for the same price, accepting Bob's offer avoids potentially complicating the deal with John."
