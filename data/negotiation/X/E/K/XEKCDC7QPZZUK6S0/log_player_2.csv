Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above your alternative option of buying from John for $800,000. It's unlikely she'll go as low as $800,000, so it's in your best interest to take the guaranteed deal from John."
