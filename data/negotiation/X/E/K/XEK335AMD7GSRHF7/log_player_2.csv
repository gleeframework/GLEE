"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let you have it for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you know John is offering. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That's a bit steep for me, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. How about $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial price. It accomplishes a few things:

* **Signals Interest:**  It shows Alice that you're serious about buying, but not at her original price. 
* **Establishes a Low Anchor:**  Negotiation research shows that starting low can influence the final outcome. 
* **Leaves Room for Movement:**  You've given yourself space to negotiate upwards while staying well below your $10,000 limit. 

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to your budget, but she's still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,000? That's a fair offer, and it works for my budget."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Shows Willingness to Compromise:** You've increased your offer, demonstrating that you're willing to move towards her price.
* **Stays Within Budget:** You're still comfortably below your $10,000 limit, leaving room for a possible small increase if needed. 
* **Puts Pressure on Alice:** By proposing a price closer to John's offer, you're subtly reminding Alice that you have an alternative option. 

This offer strikes a good balance between getting a better deal and potentially closing the deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000 yet. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems Alice is not willing to budge into a price range that works for you.  She's actually gone up in price!  It's time to cut your losses and go with your guaranteed good deal from John."
