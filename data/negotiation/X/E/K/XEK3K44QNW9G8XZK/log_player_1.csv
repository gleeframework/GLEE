Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Could you do $12,000?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob seems firm on his $8,500 offer. It's unlikely he'll go much higher.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
