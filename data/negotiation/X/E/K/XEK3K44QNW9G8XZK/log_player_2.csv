"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation. This initial counteroffer is within his budget, and also acknowledges the value of the product, potentially making Alice more receptive to further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Could you do $12,000?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $12,000 is still outside of Bob's budget.  He needs to continue negotiating to get the price lower.  He can still potentially get a better deal with Alice, and he also has the option of buying from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer. He believes that $8,500 is a fair price for both parties, especially considering Alice's willingness to negotiate.  This shows confidence and might encourage Alice to accept, as he's not budging.  He's also highlighting the potential for a win-win situation."
