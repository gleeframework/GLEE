Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** This is the lowest price you're willing to accept ($12,000).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** You can sell to John for $12,000, ensuring you get your minimum acceptable price.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's enticing to Bob while maximizing your potential gain. Here's how:

1. **Start High:**  Don't start at Bob's valuation. Aim higher to leave room for negotiation.
2. **Be Confident:**  Present your offer with confidence, highlighting the product's value.
3. **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Expect Bob to counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate slightly, but don't go below your reservation price.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm offering it to you at $13,500. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment."", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $13,500 is significantly above Bob's valuation and provides a good cushion for negotiation.
* **Value-Focused Message:** The message emphasizes the product's value, justifying the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone suggests you're open to discussing the price further, encouraging Bob to engage.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:**  If Bob doesn't meet a price that's acceptable to you (above $12,000), you have John as a guaranteed buyer.
* **Negotiate in Good Faith:** While aiming for the best price, be respectful and fair in your dealings with Bob."
