"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000.  I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product for me. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $750,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me, while also acknowledging your desire to spend less. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm committed to getting this product, but I can't go above $725,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to maintain a minimum of $750,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm offering the product to you for $735,000. This is a fair compromise that should meet your needs while still recognizing the value of the product to me. What do you think?",735000.0,Alice,5,
