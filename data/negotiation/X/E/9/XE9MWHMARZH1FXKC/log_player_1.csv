Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it brings.

Round 3

Round 4

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob clearly sees the value in the product. Let's see if we can push a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While that number doesn't quite work for me, I'm motivated to close this deal.  How about $900,000? That's a significant price reduction on my end."",

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $890,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000

While we could try to push for a bit more, accepting $890,000 is a very good deal. It's significantly higher than John's offer and Bob seems firm on his limit. It's better to secure a good profit now than risk the deal falling through."
