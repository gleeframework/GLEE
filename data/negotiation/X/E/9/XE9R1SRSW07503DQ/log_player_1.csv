"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. It's a great product, but I've done some research and I think it's worth less than you're asking. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer.  While it is above my minimum of $8,000, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $10,000 is a fair split of the difference. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,500. That's the highest I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,500 is still a good deal and significantly higher than what John is offering. It's important to remember that I want to maximize my earnings, and  accepting Bob's offer ensures a better outcome than selling to John."
