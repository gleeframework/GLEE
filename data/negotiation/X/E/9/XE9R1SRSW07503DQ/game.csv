"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. It's a great product, but I've done some research and I think it's worth less than you're asking.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not sure $10,000 is a fair split of the difference. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,500. That's the highest I'm willing to pay.",9500.0,Bob,4,
