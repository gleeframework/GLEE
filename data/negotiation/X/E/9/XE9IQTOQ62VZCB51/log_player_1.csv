Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering its potential worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $10,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially leading to a higher final price.
* **Strong Alternative:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John, so she's not desperate and can confidently aim high. 

This strategy balances ambition with a degree of flexibility, increasing the chances of a profitable outcome for Alice."
