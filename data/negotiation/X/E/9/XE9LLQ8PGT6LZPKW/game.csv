"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to secure the product for a slightly lower price. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable price that still allows for a profitable transaction for you. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
