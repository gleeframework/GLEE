"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is the midpoint between our last two offers.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
