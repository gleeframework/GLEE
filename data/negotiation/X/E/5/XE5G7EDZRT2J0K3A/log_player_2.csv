"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for a price that's still very attractive, but allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's discuss a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from what the product is worth to you, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to miss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
