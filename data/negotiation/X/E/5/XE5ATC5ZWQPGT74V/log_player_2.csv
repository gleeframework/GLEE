"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that could be quite valuable to you, and I'm confident it would be a great investment. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15000. This is a fair price considering its potential, and it's definitely lower than what I could get elsewhere. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.
