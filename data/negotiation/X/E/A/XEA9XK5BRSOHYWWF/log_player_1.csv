Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the immense value in. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and represents a significant opportunity for you."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), I want to start negotiations significantly closer to Bob's valuation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $1,350,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still securing a significant profit for me. 
* **Confident and Justified:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a fair reflection of its potential, making it more convincing to Bob.

**Why not go higher?:**

While I could start even higher, it risks alienating Bob and making him less likely to engage in negotiation. This offer balances ambition with a sense of reasonableness."
