"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a reasonable price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your target price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
