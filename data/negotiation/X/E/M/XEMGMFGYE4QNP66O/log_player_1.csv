Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, leaving room for potential concessions. It is well above your minimum acceptable price but still significantly below the value the product holds for Bob. This creates a reasonable starting point for negotiation and encourages Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below the value the product holds for him.  By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a higher price. I can still make a significant profit by selling to John, so there's no immediate need to settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. It demonstrates my willingness to compromise while maintaining a price that is still above my minimum acceptable amount. This approach aims to find a middle ground and potentially secure a deal that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe there's potential for a higher deal, and rejecting his offer allows me to try for a better outcome. I can always fall back on selling to John if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

This final counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired amount. It signals that I am serious about making a deal but am not willing to settle for significantly less than the value I perceive the product to hold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's only slightly below my minimum acceptable amount.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price, and risking a complete breakdown of the negotiations would leave me with only the $800,000 offer from John. It's better to secure the deal now and avoid the risk."
