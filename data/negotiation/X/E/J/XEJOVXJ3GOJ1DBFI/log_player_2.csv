"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is above your maximum value of $100.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $85? I think that's a fair price considering your value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum value.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially get a better price. There's a chance she might lower her offer again, or you can counter with a price closer to your limit."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $87?  I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 87}
