"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, and I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $10,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and allows me to cover my costs.  Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
