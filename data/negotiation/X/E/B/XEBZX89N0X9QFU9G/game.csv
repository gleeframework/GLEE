"Hi Alice,  $13,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This would be a fair price for both of us and I'm confident it's a good deal for the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
