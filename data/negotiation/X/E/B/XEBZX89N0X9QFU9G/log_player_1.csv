Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to start the price at $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $13,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This would be a fair price for both of us and I'm confident it's a good deal for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

This is a strategic decision point. Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and we're already close to John's offer.  It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than to risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
