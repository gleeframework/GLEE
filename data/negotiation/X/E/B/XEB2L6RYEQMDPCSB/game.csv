"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $7,200. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",7200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $7,200 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Could you do $6,800?",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still not willing to go below $7,000. I'd like to counteroffer at $7,100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value to you.",7100.0,Alice,5,
