Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to split the difference exactly, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to counteroffer at $7,050. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting the $7,050 offer secures a reasonable discount and avoids the risk of the deal falling through.  It's better to secure a good deal now than potentially lose out by pushing for a slightly lower price."
