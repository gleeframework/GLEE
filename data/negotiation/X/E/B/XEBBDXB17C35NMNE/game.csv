"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks great but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm really interested, but my maximum budget is $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $12,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway - how about $10,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $13,000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
