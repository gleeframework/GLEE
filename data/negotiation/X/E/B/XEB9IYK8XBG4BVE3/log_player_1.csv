Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's in great condition and worth a lot more, but I'm willing to make a deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $130. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than $100 from John, I still believe the product is worth more than that. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested. However, $130 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $135. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $135 is closer to my desired price than $100 from John, and we're running out of rounds. It's better to take a slightly lower price than risk losing the deal altogether."
