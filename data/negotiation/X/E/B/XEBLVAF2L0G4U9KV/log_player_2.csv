"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal. You know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, and you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000.  There's room to negotiate. Rejecting her offer allows you to start the counteroffer process."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still below my target price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but it's still a bit higher than you'd like. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's still room to negotiate a better price with Alice.  Rejecting her offer will allow you to counteroffer again and potentially get closer to your target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're serious about making a deal, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000 and its value to you is $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While $1,080,000 is slightly above your desired $1,000,000, it's still within your budget and represents a good compromise. You could continue to negotiate, but it's likely Alice won't budge much further. Accepting her offer allows you to secure the product for a price that is still a good deal, and avoids the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer or you losing the opportunity to buy from John."
