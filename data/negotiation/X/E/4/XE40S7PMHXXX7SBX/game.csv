"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this item. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the item, and it's a compromise that I'm comfortable with. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950000 for the product, which reflects a significant reduction from your initial asking price. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $950000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
