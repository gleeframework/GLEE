"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's worth that much to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  I understand if you need to think about it, but I'm sure we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You have no incentive to accept Alice's offer. You're willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, and that's exactly what Alice is offering. However, you can simply buy the product from John for the same price. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer in this scenario."
