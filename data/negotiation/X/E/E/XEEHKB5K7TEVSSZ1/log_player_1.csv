"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $11,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,000 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference at $10,750.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 
 
While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is clearly anchored around the $10,500 - $11,000 range. Accepting his offer of $10,750 secures a good profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
