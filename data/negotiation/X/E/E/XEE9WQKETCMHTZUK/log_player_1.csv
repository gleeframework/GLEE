Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but I can't quite meet that $1,725,000 price.  Would you be open to $1,462,500?

```

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently aiming for a price well below my minimum.  While he's moving upwards slowly, it's unlikely he'll reach an acceptable price within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price without further risk or negotiation."
