"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $1,500,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the product for the lowest possible price. While $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's budget than the initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given the value of the product to me and my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,312,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,312,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,312,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,312,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  At this point, Bob has a few considerations:

* **Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or the deal falling apart.
* **Time:** There are only 5 rounds left. 
* **Alternative:** John is offering a guaranteed deal at Bob's maximum budget. 

Given these factors, it's more prudent for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John and avoid the uncertainty and potential wasted time of further negotiation."
