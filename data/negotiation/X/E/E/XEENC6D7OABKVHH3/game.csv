"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given the value of the product to me and my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,312,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1312500.0,Alice,5,
