{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,400,000.  It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is still a fantastic deal for you, given the product's value.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I need to be around $1,200,000 for this to work for me. Do you think we can make that happen? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is right at my minimum, but given the limited rounds left and the potential risk of further negotiation, it's best to accept his offer."
