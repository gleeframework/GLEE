"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $140. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $80. It's worthwhile to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $80.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $80.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if I can get Alice closer to my target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $95 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $102.50 is getting closer, it's still above my $80 limit. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get Alice closer to my target price, especially since I know I can buy from John for $80 if this doesn't work out."
