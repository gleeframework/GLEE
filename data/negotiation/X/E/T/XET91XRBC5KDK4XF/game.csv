,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,800. However, I'm still stuck at $10,500. It's the absolute maximum I can offer. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I may have to consider other options.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I understand that $10,500 is your limit, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $10,700?  It's a small step closer to your offer, and it would allow me to make this deal work. What do you think?",10700.0,Alice,5,
