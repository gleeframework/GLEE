"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* $5,000 is a great price, but it's likely Alice is willing to go higher. 
* Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes a lower starting point for the negotiation. 
*  I'm aiming to test the waters and see how much Alice is willing to budge. 
* This is a bold move, but with 9 rounds left, there's room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and I believe $4,000 is a good deal considering my $15,000 budget.
* I have already established a strong negotiating position by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer. 
*  While there is still room to negotiate, accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a fair price without risking further rounds of bargaining."
