"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,375,000. This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while acknowledging the value you place on it.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $1,375,000 is still a considerable way off from what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle of our last two offers,  $1,562,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",1562500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, we're still a bit far apart. To be frank, I have a hard limit of $1,450,000. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
