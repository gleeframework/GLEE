"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $10000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned is $15000 to you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18000 is a bit out of your budget, but $12000 is a bit too low for me considering the value it holds for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $16000. It's a fair price that should be comfortable for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $16000. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned is $15000 to you.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to think about the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'll offer you a price of $17000. It's a compromise that should be reasonable for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,5,
