"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8,500. Considering your willingness to go up to $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $8,750. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value.
