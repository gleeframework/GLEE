"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and based on your needs, I think that's you. I'm initially proposing a price of $11,500. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $11,500 is too high.  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so a counteroffer of $10,500 is a reasonable starting point. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still offering a significant saving for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However,  $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $11,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save money. While Alice's offer of $11,000 is lower than the initial $11,500, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This would be a good compromise for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal.  Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his ideal price but still wants to leave room for negotiation.  A counteroffer of $10,750 is a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's current offer.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I want to find a way for us to make this work.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,875? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,875 is very close to Bob's desired price point.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice backing out or the negotiation stalling is high.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best course of action, securing the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer while avoiding further potential delays."
