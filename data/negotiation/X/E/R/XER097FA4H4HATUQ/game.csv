"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and based on your needs, I think that's you. I'm initially proposing a price of $11,500. What are your thoughts?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However,  $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $11,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the product's true value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This would be a good compromise for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal.  Let's make it happen!",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I want to find a way for us to make this work.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,875? That's my final offer.",10875.0,Alice,5,
