Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'll meet you at $11,150, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,150.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has signaled this is her final offer.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll hold firm and we'll end up with a worse deal or having to go with John's offer of $15,000. Accepting $11,150 secures a significant saving compared to John's price."
