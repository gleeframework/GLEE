{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's definitely worth trying to negotiate with her.  You have a lot of room to try and lower the price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum budget.  This is a strong opening move, and it clearly signals that I'm serious about buying but won't go higher.  It also puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or counter with a more reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower, it's still above my budget.  It's worth pushing for a better price by countering again.  I have room to negotiate, and Alice has already shown a willingness to come down in price.  I'm hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,200,000. This shows that I'm still interested in buying the product but I'm not willing to go much higher. It's a middle ground between my initial offer and Alice's latest counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price point for Alice, leading to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I'll counter again, hoping to push for a better deal. I'm still committed to getting the best price possible before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to meet her halfway but I still have a limit. I'm hoping this offer will be acceptable to Alice, as it's closer to her asking price and closer to my budget than the previous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting and getting closer to my budget, I'm still hesitant to accept it. It's just slightly over the middle ground between our last offers. I believe we can still find a price that works for both of us. I'll counter again, hoping to narrow the gap further and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,400,000.  This is a compromise that shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. It's also a move closer to Alice's last offer, suggesting that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be the final offer before we reach a deal or I decide to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,490,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,490,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $10,000 lower than my last counteroffer.  At this point, we're in a stalemate, and it's unlikely we'll come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm starting to run out of time and patience.  John's offer is significantly lower and a much more secure option. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John."
