"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $600,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to negotiate, so I propose a price of $1,000,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $700,000 is getting closer, but to be completely transparent, I have a hard minimum of $800,000 for this product.  That's why I'm offering it to you at that price - it's a firm offer, but it reflects the absolute lowest I can go.",800000.0,Alice,5,
