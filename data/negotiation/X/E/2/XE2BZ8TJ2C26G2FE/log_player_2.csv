"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $600,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to negotiate, so I propose a price of $1,000,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $700,000 is getting closer, but to be completely transparent, I have a hard minimum of $800,000 for this product.  That's why I'm offering it to you at that price - it's a firm offer, but it reflects the absolute lowest I can go.
