Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product for $12,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup at $8,000 allows you to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's financial situation or how much he's willing to pay. A more personalized approach might be possible with additional information.
* This is just an opening offer.  Bob might negotiate, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower."
