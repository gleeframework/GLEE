"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love.  I'm starting at $10,000, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand that $10,000 is high, but I'm also confident in the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 just wouldn't cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure, $7,500 is still too low for me. I need to hold out for a better offer or go with John. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can find common ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this product, but $7,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $8,500. It's a compromise, and it allows me to move forward with this sale.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but $8,500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get as close to $8,000 as possible. Would you be willing to come down to $8,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,200 is tempting and getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not completely satisfied.  I believe I can negotiate a slightly higher price and still get a good deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can bridge the gap in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,300? That way, we both get a deal that feels fair.  Let's close this out!"", ""product_price"": 8300}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,300 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget, so I'm going to make one more offer. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $8,000 is a decent offer and shows Bob's commitment, I've reached a point where my time is valuable. I'm confident I can get a better price with John, who is willing to pay my minimum of $12,000. It's a no-brainer to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
