"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob and emphasizing that it's a ""great deal"" to incentivize him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message clearly conveys that I'm open to discussing the price, encouraging Bob to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell. I would like to counter with an offer of $900,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. 
* **I have room for negotiation:**  I can still make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed higher profit:**  However, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potential lower offers from Bob. I'm holding out for a better deal, but I'm aware that John's offer is a safe fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $1,100,000 to make this deal work.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but flexible:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer but I'm not completely shutting down the negotiation. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but also have a clear bottom line.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a solution that benefits both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm not giving Bob a lot of room for further negotiation, putting pressure on him to reach an agreement."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $1,100,000.
* **I have room for negotiation:** There are still 6 rounds left, so I can continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price.
* **Selling to John is the safest option:**  However, I'm still hesitant to sell to John right now. I might be able to secure a higher price than $1,500,000 if I continue negotiating with Bob. 

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I still need a bit more to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Showing progress:** I'm acknowledging that Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, showing him that I'm negotiating in good faith.
* **Final compromise:** I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous counteroffer, demonstrating willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profit.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $1,050,000.
* **Negotiation room:**  I have 4 rounds left to secure a higher price, and I believe there's still room for a small increase.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm not willing to accept an offer that is only slightly above my minimum when I've shown a willingness to compromise and I believe there's potential for a better deal.
* **John's offer is still a safety net:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup in case negotiations with Bob fall apart."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromising further:** I'm acknowledging Bob's latest offer and making a small compromise by coming down to $1,037,500. This shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm framing this offer as a compromise that's fair to both of us. This appeals to Bob's sense of fairness and makes him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Creating urgency:** I'm emphasizing that this is the final offer, hoping to push Bob towards accepting and avoid further negotiation.
* **Staying above my minimum:** This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,050,000, ensuring I'm still getting a decent profit."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're down to the final 3 rounds, and the negotiation is getting tedious. 
* **Risk of a lower offer:**  Bob's counteroffer is only $7,500 higher than my last offer, and I'm not confident he'll budge further. There's a risk he might make a lower offer in the next round.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 is a guaranteed profit, and it's significantly higher than what I can realistically expect from Bob at this point. 

I'm choosing to sell to John to secure a higher profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might lead to a lower price."
