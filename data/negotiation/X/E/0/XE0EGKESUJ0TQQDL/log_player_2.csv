"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $12,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a compromise that still reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is closer to your budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your desired price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target of $8,000."
