,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product! While it's certainly interesting, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about $8,750? This is a fair compromise considering your profit margin and my budget. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. My next offer is $9,200. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  $9,000 is a good step in the right direction, but I'm still hoping to come in a bit lower.  Would you be willing to consider $8,900?  It's a small difference, but it would make a big impact for me.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already come down quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. My next offer is $9,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value of the product.",9250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there.  $9,250 is a good offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $9,100.  I understand this is a tight margin for you, but it would make this a much better deal for me.  What do you say?",9100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,250. I've already given you a significant discount from my initial offer. If you're willing to meet me at $9,250, I'm willing to make it happen.",9250.0,Alice,9,
