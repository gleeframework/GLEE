Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning you believe it's worth a significant amount and that you're offering it to him before a public listing, you create a sense of value and exclusivity.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While you're aiming high, you don't want to scare Bob away completely.  A price of $150 gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still ensuring a profit if he accepts. You can always fall back on John's offer of $100."
