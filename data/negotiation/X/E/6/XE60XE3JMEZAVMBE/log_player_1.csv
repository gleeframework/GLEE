"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good starting point.  This price is significantly more than Bob values the product at, but I'm hoping to leave room for negotiation and still secure a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price, but still staying significantly above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also value my product highly.  Hopefully, this encourages Bob to increase his offer further."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still far below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. There's still room for improvement, and I want to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm making another slight concession, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value. This shows Bob that I'm serious about negotiating but also that I'm not desperate to sell for his initial price. Hopefully, he'll recognize the value of the product and offer something closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's still significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with. There are only a few rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for a price so far below my desired value.  I'll continue to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm lowering my price again to show good faith, but I'm also approaching my minimum acceptable value. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'll sell to John and get my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer is close, but I'm running out of time. I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a price that's still far below what I consider fair. John offers a guaranteed price that meets my minimum, so it's the safer choice."
