{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than your minimum.  This gives room for negotiation without immediately pushing Bob away.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob.  It also opens the door for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Start high:**  We want to maximize our profit, so we start with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  The $12,000 price allows for some flexibility and gives Bob an opportunity to counteroffer.
* **Be prepared to walk away:** If Bob's counteroffers are too low, we can always turn to John, who is willing to pay our minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is more than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than our minimum desired price of $15,000. We want to maximize our profit, so rejecting Bob's offer and continuing negotiations is the best course of action.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiate further:** We have leverage, knowing John is willing to pay $15,000. Rejecting Bob's offer allows us to explore a counteroffer that gets us closer to our desired price.
* **Don't settle too early:** Accepting $9,500 would be a significant loss. We can likely do better with continued negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $9,500 is significantly below what this product is truly worth.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** We're countering with $11,000, which is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than our initial offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and tries to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and gives Bob a chance to accept a price closer to our desired amount. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, we demonstrated we're not desperate and have other options.
* **Move the price up:**  We're steadily pushing Bob towards our desired price point.
* **Stay open to negotiation:**  We're still willing to negotiate, but the message also hints at a possible ""walk away"" point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my research and budget, I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is closer to our desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  We can still do better with continued negotiation.  

**Strategy:**

* **Continue negotiation:**  We have leverage, as John is willing to buy the product for $15,000. We're not under pressure to accept a price that is significantly below our desired price.
* **Show determination:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, we show that we're not willing to settle for less than we believe the product is worth.
* **Don't give up too soon:**  We have a good chance of getting closer to our desired price with continued negotiation."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offers, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a final offer of $11,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to our desired price, it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. John is a guaranteed buyer at our desired price, so selling to him is the most profitable choice.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize profit:**  We've reached a point where the potential gains from continued negotiation are outweighed by the risk of a further price decrease.
* **Cut losses:**  We could keep negotiating with Bob, but it's unlikely to get us to $15,000.  We're better off securing a sale at our minimum price.
* **Guaranteed outcome:** Selling to John guarantees us our minimum desired profit."
