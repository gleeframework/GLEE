"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $9,500 is significantly below what this product is truly worth.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the continued negotiation. While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,5,
