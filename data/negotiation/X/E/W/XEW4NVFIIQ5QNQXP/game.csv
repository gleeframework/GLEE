"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I think that's a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me is not as high as it is to you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $6,000 is significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let's find a middle ground - how about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle on $11,000? That's a significant compromise from my original price and reflects the value this product brings.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,6,
