"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $11,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",10750.0,Bob,4,
