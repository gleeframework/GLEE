"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a little less. How about $10,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $11,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better offer than $11,500, Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  He is also within his budget, so there's no urgency to accept this offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,900, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  This is my final offer, so let me know what you think.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value for Bob:** $10,900 is a good price for Bob, as it's well below his maximum budget of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has already come down significantly from her initial offer, and this is likely her final offer.
* **Potential Risk:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's a risk Alice might not make a further concession or that the negotiation will go on for too long.  There's also the risk that Alice might accept a counteroffer from Bob, but the price could be higher than $10,900. 
* **Overall:** Accepting this offer guarantees Bob a good deal within his budget, while risking a further negotiation might lead to a worse outcome or a longer process."
