"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is a better price than $120, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  

* **Alice's value:** The product is worth $80 to Alice, meaning she's willing to sell for anything above that.
* **Bob's value:** The product is worth $120 to Bob, meaning he's willing to pay up to that amount.

There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the initial offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $90, which is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  

* It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about getting a better deal.
* It's still above Alice's value of $80, leaving room for Alice to accept while still making a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $95
* **Bob's value:** $120
* **John's price:** $120

While Bob could continue to negotiate, Alice's counteroffer of $95 is a good deal for him. It's lower than John's price and is still above Alice's value, making it a win-win situation."
