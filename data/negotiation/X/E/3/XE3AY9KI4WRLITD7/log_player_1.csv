Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you there to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above $1300000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking $1200000 is a fair price for the product. Can you consider it?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but it seems like he is still a bit too low. Given that I have limited rounds left, it's better to secure a sale with John rather than risk a counteroffer from Bob that will leave me with an even lower price."
