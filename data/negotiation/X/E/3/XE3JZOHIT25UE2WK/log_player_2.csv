"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its unique features and the quality it offers, I believe it would greatly benefit your operations. For this exceptional opportunity, I am offering the product at a special introductory price of $9500. This is a limited-time offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $15,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the introductory price, I'm looking to stay closer to the $10,000 mark.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000 for this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. In light of that, I am willing to consider your offer. However, due to the costs associated with production and maintaining high-quality standards, I cannot accept the full $10000. I am proposing a price of $9750 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only $250 higher than your initial counteroffer of $10,000. This is a very small difference and likely worth accepting to avoid further negotiation. It's still a significant savings compared to buying from John for $15,000."
