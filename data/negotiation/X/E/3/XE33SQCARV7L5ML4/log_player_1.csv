Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This gives you some flexibility to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects your offer.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This price shows that you're serious about selling to Bob, but also that you value your product. 

Remember, you can always adjust the price later based on Bob's response. You can also use the threat of selling to John to incentivize Bob to accept your offer. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could we settle around $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum valuation of $1,500,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $1,200,000.  Accepting his offer would be a huge loss for me.  

I will counteroffer with a higher price, but I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet me closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but I can't go any lower than that.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly less than my minimum valuation of $1,500,000.  

I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'll make one final counteroffer. If Bob doesn't meet me closer to my desired price, I'll sell to John."
