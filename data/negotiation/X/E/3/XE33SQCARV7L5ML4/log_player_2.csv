Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but I can't go any lower than that.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still too low for me. This product is valuable, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $850,000.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll be selling to John.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm and her final offer of $850,000 is above your maximum budget. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a real risk Alice will follow through on selling to John.  It's better to secure the product at your target price with John than risk losing it entirely."
