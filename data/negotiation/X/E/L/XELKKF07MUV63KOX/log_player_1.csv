"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. My starting price is $1,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to me to make Bob aware of its importance and potentially pique his interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm conveying that I'm willing to negotiate, which makes the offer more appealing and less likely to be immediately rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:**  The product is worth at least $800,000 to me.  Bob's offer is closer, but still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:**  While selling to John guarantees $800,000, I want to maximize my profit. I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $950,000 to make this work for me.  Let's see if we can bridge that gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,000,000 to $950,000.
* **Staying Firm:** I'm still above Bob's offer, but not by a huge margin, showing that I'm serious about selling but also not desperate.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to me, subtly reminding Bob why a higher price is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $950000. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $925000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $925,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'd prefer more, the negotiation has been steadily moving in my favor. There's a good chance I could get a better offer in the next round, but there's also a risk of losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We are already on round 4, leaving only 6 rounds left. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation failures.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most prudent decision, balancing the potential for a higher price with the certainty of a good profit and the risk of losing the deal altogether."
