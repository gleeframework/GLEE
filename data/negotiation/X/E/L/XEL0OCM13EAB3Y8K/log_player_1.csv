{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,200 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $8,200 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,700, which still leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8700 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8200, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8350. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,350
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a higher price, $8,350 is a good compromise and getting closer to my minimum. It's better than selling to John and allows me to secure a deal without further negotiation."
