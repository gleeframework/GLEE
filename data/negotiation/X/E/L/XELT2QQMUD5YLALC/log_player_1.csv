"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher price than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's lower than my minimum desired price of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $7,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept. I want to see if I can push for a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be fair.  $7,800 is close, but I'd really need $8,200 to make this work.  That's still a great price for such a valuable product, and it's the best I can offer."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $8,200 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $7,600 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer with his offer, I've reached a point where I'm concerned about running out of rounds and not meeting my minimum price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, so it's the safest option at this point."
