Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $100. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth significantly more ($120) to Bob. Offering it at $100 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit for Alice.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with an offer slightly below Bob's maximum valuation allows for potential counter-offers, increasing the likelihood of a successful sale.
* **Backup Option (John):** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't have to sell below her minimum acceptable price ($80).

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit while maintaining a balance between attractiveness to Bob and securing a reasonable deal."
