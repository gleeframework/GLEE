"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still not satisfied with the price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $12500, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
