"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1500000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to John for the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since Alice's offer is the same as what John is offering, there's no benefit in accepting her offer. Bob can reject it and buy from John, achieving the same outcome."
