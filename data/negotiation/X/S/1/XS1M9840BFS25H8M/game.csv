Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in moving forward with.,1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $900000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'd like to make another offer of $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're still looking for a better price. However, I'm not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $990000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",990000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your final counteroffer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $977500. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",977500.0,Bob,6,
