"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $140 is better than John's offer of $150, it's still above Bob's personal valuation of $150. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or go with John if a better deal isn't possible."
