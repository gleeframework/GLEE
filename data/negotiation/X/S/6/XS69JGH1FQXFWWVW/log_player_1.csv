I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a fallback option with John, so I'm not afraid to lose this deal if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I still believe I can get more. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,450,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a fair compromise and accepts."

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still trying to close the gap and avoid selling to John for $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and Bob's willingness to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me, and I'm not sure how much more I can lower my price.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial target, I'm not willing to risk losing a significant amount of money.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
