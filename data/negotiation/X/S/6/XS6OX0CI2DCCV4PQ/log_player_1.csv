"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with an offer significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This anchors the negotiation high and leaves room for strategic concessions.
* **Justifying the Price:**  While the price is high, I'm framing it with an emphasis on the product's ""unique value and potential,"" aiming to appeal to Bob's desire for a good deal.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This initial high offer signals my willingness to negotiate while setting a strong initial position.  

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while gauging Bob's interest and flexibility in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant move, it's still considerably higher than his perceived value of the product. I believe there's room for further negotiation. Accepting his offer now would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table. 

I'm willing to engage in further rounds to try and reach a price closer to my target, but I'll also carefully consider my alternative option (selling to John) at each step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of this unique product."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I've made a substantial concession of $100,000, signaling my willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price well above both my minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Holding Firm:**  I'm not immediately meeting Bob's price, indicating that I'm aiming for a higher final agreement. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm again subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the high price point.

I'll continue to assess Bob's responses to gauge his price sensitivity and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'm aiming to create a sense of progress in the negotiation while maximizing my potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to my range, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. He's increased his offer by $50,000, indicating a willingness to compromise.  I'll continue to negotiate strategically, aiming for a price closer to $1,800,000. I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a potential fallback, but I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about we meet halfway - $1,825,000. This reflects my desire to strike a deal while ensuring a fair price for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By proposing a price directly in the middle of our current positions, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise and find an agreement.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  As we're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds, I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to reach a decision.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm continuing to reinforce the value of the product, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits he would gain.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal within the remaining rounds. I believe this offer is reasonable and appealing while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts in negotiating, Alice. Considering my financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $1,775,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,775,000 is now getting very close to my walk-away point. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that the final offer won't be significantly better.  

Here's why accepting now makes sense: 

* **Strong Profit:** $1,775,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and potential delays. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  There's always a risk that Bob could decide not to purchase at all. Accepting guarantees the sale. 

This decision balances maximizing profit with the practicalities of negotiation and risk management."
