"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I believe it would significantly contribute to your endeavors or personal satisfaction. After careful consideration, I propose to offer you this exceptional item at a price that reflects its true worth while allowing me to recover my investment. My proposal is to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This offer represents a fair compromise that respects the value you see in the product while ensuring a profitable transaction for me. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of bringing this remarkable product into your possession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is overvaluing the product to you.** She claims it's worth $1,500,000 to you, but you've set your maximum price at $1,500,000, meaning any extra value is irrelevant.
* **You have a backup option.** John will sell you the product for $1,500,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay her asking price. She might come back with a lower offer closer to her own valuation of $800,000. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting this offer, you aim to either:

* Get Alice to lower her price significantly in a counter-offer.
* Stick with your backup plan and buy from John if Alice won't budge."
