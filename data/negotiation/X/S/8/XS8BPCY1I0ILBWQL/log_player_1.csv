I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring I make a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

``` 

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a comfortable profit margin. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. This is a smaller reduction from my previous offer, indicating that I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaving room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm getting a bit tired of this negotiation, and John is offering me a guaranteed $1,500,000.  I'm going to sell to John and move on."
