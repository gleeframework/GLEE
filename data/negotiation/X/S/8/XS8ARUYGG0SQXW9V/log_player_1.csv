Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $13,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum potential profit:** Bob values the product at $15,000.  There's a potential to earn significantly more than your minimum acceptable price ($8,000).
* **Starting high:** This offer starts near Bob's maximum perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation if necessary, while still aiming for a high profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value to Bob, making the price seem more justified.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, with a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John, aiming high with Bob is the best strategy for maximizing profit."
