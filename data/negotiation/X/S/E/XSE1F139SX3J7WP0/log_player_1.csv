Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we split the difference and meet at $12,500?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would be a final offer, and a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10800 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $11,500, Bob's offer of $10,800 is getting close to my desired price range. It's also better than selling to John for $10,000. I'm going to accept this offer."
