"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product is only worth $10,000 to me. How about $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep for you, but $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Alice, while $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me.  How about we try $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 was still a bit high for you, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll give you a bit more room to negotiate. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,,
