{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than the product's value to Bob, but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate while still ensuring a decent profit for me.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm mentioning the product's value to Bob to emphasize the potential benefit of the deal for him.
* **Encouraging response:** I'm using an encouraging tone and asking for a response to keep the negotiation moving."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's close this now."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time to leverage John:** With 6 rounds remaining, I can afford to continue negotiating with Bob.  If I'm not able to get a better offer from him, I can always sell to John.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing him I'm not desperate and  that I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't come closer to my price. This might encourage him to increase his offer further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,500.  However, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
