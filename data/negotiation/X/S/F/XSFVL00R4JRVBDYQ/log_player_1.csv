"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and John's offer ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""incredible value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high initial price.
* **Alternative:** Having John's offer as a backup provides a strong bargaining position, making me less likely to settle for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still significantly below both my minimum ($1,500,000) and my initial asking price. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value that I'm confident will benefit you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've significantly lowered my price from the initial offer, signaling willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  The $1,850,000 price aims for a middle ground between Bob's offer and my previous asking price.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message reiterates the product's value, hoping to justify the still-high price tag. 
* **Time Consideration:** We're still in the early rounds, so I'm not overly concerned about time pressure from John's standing offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit far from my budget. How about we try to find a compromise at $1,500,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Offers:** Bob's offer now matches John's standing offer. 
* **Strong Position:** While I could potentially push for more, there's no guarantee Bob would go higher. Accepting ensures I don't risk losing the sale altogether and ending up with nothing. 
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids further negotiation rounds and potential delays."
