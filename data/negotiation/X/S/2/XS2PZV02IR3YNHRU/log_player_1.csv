Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit lower. How about $16,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,800

``` 

While a higher price is still possible, Bob is consistently moving towards a compromise, and we are already above John's offer. Accepting at $16,800 locks in a good profit.  Continuing carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation failing altogether."
