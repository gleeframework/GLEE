"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it will greatly benefit you. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $11,000 for it. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore counteroffers and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Considering the value of the product and aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome, I would like to propose a price of $10,750 for the product. This offers a slight compromise, allowing for a fair transaction for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,750 is lower than the initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try and bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,750 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,600.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}
