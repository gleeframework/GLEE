Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($18,000) to maximize my potential profit. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Enthusiastic Tone:** Using positive language like ""fantastic"" and ""very interested"" helps create a more positive atmosphere for the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** Based on Bob's response, I'll decide whether to counteroffer, accept, or move on to John.  
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** If Bob counters, I'll consider his offer and my own minimum acceptable price ($12,000). I may counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but I'll try to remain above my minimum. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as an option at $12,000 gives me a fallback point if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Than Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $14,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This means I can potentially get more.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There is still room to negotiate with Bob. I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John for $12,000 would be the safe option, but I'd be leaving money on the table.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than his.  I'll try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  $14,000 is a bit low for me right now. How about we split the difference at $16,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  I'm offering a price that's in the middle of our two previous offers. This shows I'm willing to compromise and be reasonable.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  Emphasizing that it's a ""fair price for both of us"" helps to build a sense of partnership and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** Depending on Bob's response, I'll decide whether to:
    * Accept his offer if he agrees to the counteroffer.
    * Counteroffer again if he rejects it, but staying above my minimum.
    * Sell to John if I feel the negotiation is going nowhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $15000. Let's see if we can finalize a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $15,000 is very close to my initial counteroffer of $16,000.  It's a good deal for me and well above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or a lower price, potentially leaving me with less money than I'd like.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting Bob's offer is a safer option than risking further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John for $12,000.

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the sale with Bob at $15,000 and move on to other opportunities."
