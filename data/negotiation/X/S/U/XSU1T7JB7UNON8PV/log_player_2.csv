"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high. You can potentially get a much better price by negotiating.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting and counteroffering is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. The goal is to push Alice towards a price closer to her minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  It's important to start aggressively to establish a good bargaining position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still worth trying to push for a lower price. You still have several rounds left, and there's a good chance you can secure a deal closer to $800,000.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 is a last resort if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 820000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small step up from your previous offer but still significantly lower than Alice's offer. The goal is to show Alice that you are serious about getting a good deal while remaining within a reasonable range.  This move also indicates that you are willing to compromise, which could lead to a faster agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $840,000 is very close to your target price, and you're now halfway through the negotiation process.  While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal to John or continuing the negotiation for a very small gain is not worth it.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and allows you to move on."
