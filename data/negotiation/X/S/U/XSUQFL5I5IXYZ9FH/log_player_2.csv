{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have 9 more rounds to reach a deal with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to lower the price by $450,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also willing to walk away if the price isn't reasonable. We have 9 rounds left, so there's room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price. I have 7 rounds remaining before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $1,450,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying, but I'm still holding firm on my budget. I'm hoping she'll accept this offer, as it's only $50,000 above my ideal price.  We have 6 rounds remaining, so there's still time to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $50,000 over my target price. While it's tempting to accept and save time, I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price in the remaining rounds. I have 5 rounds left, and I'm feeling optimistic that I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going all in with my final counteroffer. It's my target price, and with only 4 rounds left, it's time to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway.  If she rejects this offer, I'll be forced to buy from John, but at least I'll have tried to get the best possible deal."
