# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's a good deal for her, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about $925,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is still higher than my budget, but it's getting closer.  I'm not willing to pay that much yet, so I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price. I'm still hoping to get the product for closer to my $800,000 target."
