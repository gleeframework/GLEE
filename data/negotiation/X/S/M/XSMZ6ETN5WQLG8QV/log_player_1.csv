"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its value, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay.
* **Anchoring:** This initial high price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind, potentially making subsequent offers seem more reasonable. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm aware that I have John as a backup buyer, giving me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $1,500,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is substantial, it's still significantly below my initial ask.  Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and allows me to counter with a price closer to my target. I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?"",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($1,500,000) and my previous price ($1,800,000). 
* **Signaling Flexibility:**  By moving down, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still aiming high to ensure I maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant profit above my minimum ($1,200,000). 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, showing serious interest and a willingness to compromise.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation further might not yield a significantly better outcome, and it carries the risk of Bob losing interest. Accepting now secures a good deal."
