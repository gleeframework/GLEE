"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's split the difference - I'll come down to $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
