"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit above your minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but significantly lower than what Bob values the product at. This gives Bob an incentive to accept, while still giving you a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's still below your desired profit margin. You have several rounds remaining and can potentially negotiate a higher price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $11,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still not quite there. You have 6 rounds remaining and can likely push for a higher price.  It's important to remember that you have the option to sell to John for $8,000 at any time.  This provides a safety net, allowing you to take some risks with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750.  It's a good middle ground, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  I'm still trying to stay within my budget, and  $10,500 is the highest I can go at this point.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is only $500 less than your last counteroffer, and it's getting close to your minimum acceptable price. You've got 4 rounds left.  At this point, it's wise to accept the offer, as further negotiation could lead to a lower price or even the possibility of Bob walking away. You're also securing a profit, which is the primary goal."
