Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential profit margin between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of that profit margin as possible. However, being too aggressive could make Bob reject the offer. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while securing a significant portion of the potential profit for you.
* **Value-Focused Message:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""significant benefits"" reinforces the product's worth in Bob's mind.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the offer's fairness. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,350,000).
* **Relationship Value:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly less aggressive offer to foster goodwill.
