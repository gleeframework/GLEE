"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $9,500?  It's a fair compromise, and still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than what he'd pay John ($12,000).  While he could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal, and it's likely Alice won't budge much further.  Accepting the offer saves time and ensures Bob gets the product for a good price."
