Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $800,000 to you at a slight premium.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, Alice, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is tempting, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I have 8 rounds left and John is a reliable backup if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is a bit below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $825,000?  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $775,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I'm hoping we can agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $775,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I have 6 rounds remaining and I think I can push for a slightly better deal.  I'm still hopeful we can reach an agreement without having to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $775,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's the value you place on the product.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $800,000. I think $775,000 is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $787,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this deal if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob is becoming stubborn and I only have 4 rounds left. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal,  I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. John is a secure option, and I can guarantee the $800,000 price."
