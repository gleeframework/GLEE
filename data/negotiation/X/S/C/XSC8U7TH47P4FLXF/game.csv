"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $800,000 to you at a slight premium.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your product, Alice, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is a bit below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $825,000?  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $775,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I'm hoping we can agree on a price.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $775,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's the value you place on the product.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $800,000. I think $775,000 is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $787,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this deal if we can agree on this price.",787500.0,Bob,6,
