Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1325000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this asset.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  While $1,325,000 is closer to your desired price, you can still try to lower it further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your proposal, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $1287500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1315000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it holds, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,315,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,315,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While you can likely continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price, Alice's offer of $1,315,000 is getting very close to your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation could risk losing the deal entirely and forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's a calculated risk to accept the offer and secure the product."
