"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1325000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this asset.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit too high at $1325000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1287500? This is a fair compromise for both of us, and allows for a successful transaction.",1287500.0,Bob,4,
