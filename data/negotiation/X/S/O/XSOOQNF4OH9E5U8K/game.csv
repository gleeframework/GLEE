"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line.  This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet halfway at $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,375,000 is the right price. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I've already come down significantly from my initial offer.  To be frank, I have other potential buyers interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe you would benefit greatly from this product.  My final offer is $1,325,000. This is a firm offer.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you have other potential buyers interested, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,312,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",1312500.0,Bob,6,
