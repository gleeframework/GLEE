{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm only willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
