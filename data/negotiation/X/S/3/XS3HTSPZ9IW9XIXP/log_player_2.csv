"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible. While $115 is cheaper than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. That's still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $120 to you.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $110 is less than your maximum price of $120.
* **You've already negotiated:** You've lowered the price from Alice's initial $115. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might not budge.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject, Alice might walk away or increase her price again. 

Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiations."
