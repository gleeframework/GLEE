"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. That's still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $120 to you.  Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,3,
