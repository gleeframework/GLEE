"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price that's significantly below its true value to me.  I understand you value it at $800,000, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Consider it, and let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget. You can get a much better deal from John."
