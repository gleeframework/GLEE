"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for my product. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
