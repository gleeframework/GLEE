Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825,000.

Alice has come down to $815,000, which is a good deal for Bob, considering his goal is to save as much money as possible.

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids any potential complications with further negotiations."
