"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by rejecting the offer and counter-offering.  Here's why:

* **Alice's motivation:**  Alice is motivated to sell the product for more than $8,000.  There's room for negotiation.
* **Bob's risk:**  The worst-case scenario is Alice rejects the counteroffer, and Bob buys from John for $12,000. This is still within Bob's budget. 
* **Potential savings:**  By counter-offering, Bob has the potential to save $2,000.

By rejecting, Bob signals his willingness to negotiate and potentially secures a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $9,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it leaves some room for me to save."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. $9,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,750? That way, we can both be happy with the outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $9,750 is still within Bob's budget and significantly better than John's price of $12,000.
* **Risk:** While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to sell or that negotiations will drag on.
* **Potential for Loss:**  By rejecting the offer and counter-offering again, Bob risks Alice walking away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.

In this scenario, accepting Alice's offer provides Bob with a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing the product or paying more."
