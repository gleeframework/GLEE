Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially setting the price at $15,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher offer of $15,000 allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Gauge Interest:** The message aims to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. His response will give you an idea of whether he's willing to pay above $10,000. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning that you'll list it publicly if Bob declines creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing him to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. Depending on Bob's response, you can adjust your price accordingly in further negotiations."
