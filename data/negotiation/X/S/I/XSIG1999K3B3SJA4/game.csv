"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $18000 for it.  It's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $15000.  What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer.  However, $15000 is a little too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $16500.  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $16500 is closer, but still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to pay $16000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",16000.0,Bob,4,
