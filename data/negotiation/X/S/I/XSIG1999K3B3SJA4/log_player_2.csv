"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $18000 for it.  It's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is above my maximum budget of $15,000. It's better to reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer.  However, $15000 is a little too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $16500.  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's counteroffer is still above my budget. I can try to negotiate further to see if I can get a lower price. I can still buy from John for $15,000, so I have a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $16,500 is closer, but still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to pay $16,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
