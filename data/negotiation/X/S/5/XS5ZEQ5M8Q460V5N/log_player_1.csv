Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can justify paying $1,500,000 for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750,000. Can you consider my counteroffer?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'd like to propose $900,000. Can we meet at this price?

You have three options:

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear he's hesitant to meet my valuation.  It's not worth risking losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
