"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know is worth a great deal to you. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. While I'm not at liberty to disclose the details yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1.5 million to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount for a product of this caliber. Let's talk further about this incredible offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly employing pressure tactics by exaggerating the product's worth to you. You know your upper limit is $1,500,000, and you have a guaranteed option with John at that price.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or even get John to come down a bit."
