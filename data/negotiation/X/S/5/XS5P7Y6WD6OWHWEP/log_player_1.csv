Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $10,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your initial offer, $20,000 is closer to my bottom line for this product.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
