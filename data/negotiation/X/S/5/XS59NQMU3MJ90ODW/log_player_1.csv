Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm a bit constrained by my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed offer.  There's no point in further negotiation with Bob, as it's unlikely he'll go above $1,500,000. Accepting John's offer ensures I get the maximum value without the risk of prolonged negotiation."
