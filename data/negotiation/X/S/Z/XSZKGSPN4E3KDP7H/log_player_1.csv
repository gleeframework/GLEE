Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for potential negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, giving you the chance to still land above your minimum price. 
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers adds pressure for Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your offer.

**Important Note:** While this is a starting point, observing Bob's reactions and being prepared to slightly adjust your price during the negotiation could increase your chances of a successful sale."
