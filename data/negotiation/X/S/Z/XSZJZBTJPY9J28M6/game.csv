"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $100.  How about we meet in the middle at $107?",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $107 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $111? It's a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's make a deal!",111.0,Alice,5,
