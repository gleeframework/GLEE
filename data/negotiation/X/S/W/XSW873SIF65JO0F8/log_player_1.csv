Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a steal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and uses language like ""fantastic"" and ""steal"" to make the offer appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I've left the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with keeping the negotiation open and engaging Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $14500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but still below my minimum:** While $14,500 is closer to my minimum of $10,000, it's still not a price I'm willing to accept.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Since Bob is interested and willing to negotiate, there's potential to get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is a last resort:**  While selling to John for $10,000 is an option, I'd prefer to try and get a better deal with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I value the product highly, I'm willing to come down to $14,750. This reflects the product's quality and the value you'll get from it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to see the value in a slightly higher price. 
* **Open to Agreement:** The message emphasizes reaching an agreement, indicating a willingness to continue the negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still positioning me for a favorable outcome."
