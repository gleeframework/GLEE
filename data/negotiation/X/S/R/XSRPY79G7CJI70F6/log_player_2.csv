"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9000 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $9,500 is less than Bob's maximum of $12,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  While Bob could try to counter again, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob keeps rejecting offers, he risks Alice getting frustrated and choosing not to deal with him, or going back to her original asking price.
* **Time constraint:**  Bob only has 10 rounds to make a deal.  

Accepting the offer secures the product at a decent price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
