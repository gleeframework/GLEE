"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that I think is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1200000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to go up to $800000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1200000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'll make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $875000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm afraid I've reached my limit, Alice. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm going to have to go with my backup plan and buy the product from John for $1200000. I'm not willing to go any higher than $825000. This is my final offer.",825000.0,Bob,6,
