"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This allows for some profit for you while staying within my price range. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
