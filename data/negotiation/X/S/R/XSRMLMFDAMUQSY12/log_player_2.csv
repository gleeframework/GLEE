"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there is room for negotiation to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. He's willing to pay up to $850,000, and Alice is at $900,000. A counteroffer closer to his desired price could potentially seal the deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking for a bit more flexibility, but I'm not willing to go as high as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has already made a significant concession, moving from $850,000 to $875,000. Alice, however, is only willing to budge down to $920,000. At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice might be futile, especially considering that she's already offered a final price. 

It's now more cost-effective for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. While it's a higher price, it eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations and the risk that Alice might not budge further."
