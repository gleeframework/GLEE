"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $110. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $110 is still a little high for my budget. How about we split the difference again and settle on $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $105. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",105.0,Alice,5,
