"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $10200 is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9800, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10500, which is still a great deal considering its value to you. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose a price of $9950. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9950.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $9950 is still a bit above my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10300, which is the best I can do. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I think this is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",10300.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any higher than $9950. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $12000.",9950.0,Bob,8,
