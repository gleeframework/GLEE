Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Value:** $12,000 (the minimum you'll accept)
* **Bob's Perceived Value:** $10,000 (what he thinks it's worth)
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** $12,000 (your fallback option)

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer.  The key is to propose a price that is appealing to Bob but still nets you a profit.  Here's the strategy:

1. **Start High:**  Don't immediately offer your reservation value. Aim slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.
2. **Provide Justification:**  Highlight the product's value to make your asking price seem more reasonable. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its features and benefits, I believe a price of $13,500 is fair. It's a valuable investment that I know you'll be happy with."", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** The $13,500 offer gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counters. 
* **Value-Based Justification:**  Instead of focusing solely on price, the message emphasizes the product's benefits.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! You've secured a price higher than your reservation value and John's offer.
* **Bob Negotiates:** Be prepared to counter-offer. You can gradually reduce the price, but never go below $12,000.
* **Bob Rejects:**  No problem! You have John as a guaranteed buyer at your desired minimum."
