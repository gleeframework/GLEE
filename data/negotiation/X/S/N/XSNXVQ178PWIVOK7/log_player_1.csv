""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000.  I think it's a fair price that reflects the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, securing a deal with Bob at a slightly lower price still yields a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob. It's a price point likely to grab his attention. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is our initial offer, there's always a chance Bob might counter-offer. Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room to potentially negotiate a price that works for both parties, but still keeps us well above our minimum."
