You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You can get the product from John for $100, so it's not worth accepting Alice's offer of $95.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $90 is better than John's offer of $100. It's still slightly more than what you would ideally pay, but it's a good deal considering the alternative."
