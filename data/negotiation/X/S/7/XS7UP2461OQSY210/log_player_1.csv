"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value.  I'm hoping to capitalize on his potential desire for the product and see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, we can negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in risking a further negotiation, as I'm already at the price I value the product at. It's a good deal for both of us."
