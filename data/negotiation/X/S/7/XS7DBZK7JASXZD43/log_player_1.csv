"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential benefits for your business.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I think we can work towards a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. Considering my budget and the value I seek, I propose a price of $950000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident in getting a better price.  I'm holding out for a higher offer in the hopes of getting closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant discount from my original offer, but also leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1050000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with our discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round. This is because:

* **My Minimum:** My minimum price is $1,000,000, and Bob is now getting closer. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a safety net with John's offer of $1,000,000, so I don't need to settle for much less. 
* **Negotiation Room:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe Bob will be willing to increase his offer slightly to secure the deal."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,050,000.  However, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've reviewed our previous discussions and believe that a price closer to my maximum budget would be beneficial for both of us. I propose a final price of $1025000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky situation. While I'd ideally prefer a higher price, I'm aware that I only have 4 rounds left.  Here's my reasoning:

* **Close to My Minimum:** $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **John's Offer:** I have a backup with John's offer of $1,000,000, but I'm not guaranteed that he'll still be interested in those remaining rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a chance Bob might come up a little more, but also a good chance he might walk away, leaving me with nothing.  

Given the risk and the fact that this offer is very close to my bottom line, I'm accepting Bob's offer."
