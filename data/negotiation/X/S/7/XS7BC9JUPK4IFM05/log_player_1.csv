Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think you'll find it's a great deal."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a quick and profitable sale.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The $115 offer leaves some space for Bob to counteroffer if he wants, allowing for potential negotiation while still staying above my minimum acceptable price ($100). 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware that I have John as a backup buyer at $100, so I won't go below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Profitable:** Bob's offer of $105 is still more than my minimum of $100. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a $10 gap between his offer and my initial asking price. I believe I can negotiate for a better deal.
* **John as Backup:** I'll keep John in mind as a safety net, but I'm confident I can get closer to $110 with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's a very competitive price for this product."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By suggesting $110, I'm splitting the difference between his offer ($105) and my previous asking price ($115). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Firm but Fair:** The tone of the message remains friendly and open to negotiation, but I'm clearly signaling that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm still keeping John's $100 offer in mind as a fallback option if Bob continues to push for a significantly lower price."
