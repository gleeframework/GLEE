"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are aiming to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still a significant amount over your ideal price.
* **There are still 9 rounds left.**  This gives you ample time to negotiate a better price.
* **Buying from John is not the best option yet.**  John's price is your absolute ceiling, and you should try to do better if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at $875,000. This is still a great deal, considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's come down, it's still above your desired price point. 
* **You have room to negotiate further.** With 7 rounds remaining, you have time to see if you can get closer to your target.
* **Buying from John is still not the best option.**  You're making progress with Alice, and you're better off continuing to try to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  However, $875,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $860,000.  This is a fair compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $860,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product at $870,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer, but still not ideal.**  You're only $10,000 away from your target price, which is a significant amount.
* **You have time to negotiate further.**  You still have 5 rounds left to try to get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still not the best option.**  You're making good progress and have the potential to get a better deal with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $870,000, but I'm getting closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $865,000?  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 865000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $865,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product at $880,000. This is the final price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting close to your target.** You are only $20,000 away from your desired price. 
* **You are running out of time.**  With only 3 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal increases.
* **Buying from John is still too expensive.**  Although you could still get a deal with John, you're closer to your goal with Alice.

While it would be great to get closer to $850,000, it's becoming increasingly likely that you'll be unable to get Alice lower.  Accepting the offer now ensures a deal, and you're still getting a decent price."
