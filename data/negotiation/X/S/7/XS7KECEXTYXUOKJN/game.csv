"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at $875,000. This is still a great deal, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  However, $875,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $860,000.  This is a fair compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $860,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product at $870,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",870000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $870,000, but I'm getting closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $865,000?  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.",865000.0,Bob,6,
