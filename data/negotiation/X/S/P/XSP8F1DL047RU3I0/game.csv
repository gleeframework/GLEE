"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $11000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to buy it for $10500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to work with you, $10500 is still a bit below my desired price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10750? This would still be a good deal for you and allow me to make a fair profit.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $10750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10600.  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",10600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  While $10600 is a good offer, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  Let's try $10650.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach a win-win situation.",10650.0,Alice,5,
