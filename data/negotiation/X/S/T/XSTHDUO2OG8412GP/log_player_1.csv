I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.  I believe this is a good starting point to see if Bob is genuinely interested and what his budget might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to accept it right away.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I hope this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob is now offering significantly less than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and John is offering a price that meets my minimum. Therefore, I will sell to John."
