"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd be willing to buy it for $850,000. Let me know if that works for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value to you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
