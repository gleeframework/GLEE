I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,100,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd be willing to buy it for $850,000. Let me know if that works for you.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit short of my target.

This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
