"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its high quality and unique features, it's valued at $100 by many of our customers. Considering its worth to you, I believe we can come to an agreement. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $95? This is a special offer tailored to appreciate your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $100.  It's better to reject her offer and purchase from John, even though it means paying the full price."
