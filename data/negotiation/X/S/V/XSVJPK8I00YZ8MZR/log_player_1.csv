Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you a strong negotiating position.
* **Targeting Above Your Minimum:**  You absolutely don't want to sell for less than $800,000 (your guaranteed price from John). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,200,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" to justify the high price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he counters your proposal."
