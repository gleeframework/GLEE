"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Even though Alice's offer is above her value ($800,000), it's still significantly lower than the price John is offering ($1,500,000).
* **Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.** Accepting Alice's offer means saving $300,000 compared to buying from John."
