"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I believe that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $9,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,000. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
