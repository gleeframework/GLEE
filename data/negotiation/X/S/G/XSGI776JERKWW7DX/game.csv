"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $11,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as close to $11,000 as possible. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $11,300, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11300.0,Alice,5,
