Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still a good price point for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm highlighting the value to Bob by emphasizing it's a good price for him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language like ""Let me know what you think"" to signal that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not desperate. 

This approach aims to find a good middle ground, maximizing my potential earnings while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,000,000? This would allow me to make a purchase without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I have room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to my desired amount. 
* **John as a safety net:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer if it's not satisfactory. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range. I will aim to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is just too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer but am showing flexibility by offering a counteroffer that's closer to his price but still above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to reiterate the value of the deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and open to negotiation, signaling a willingness to find a solution.

**Goal:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price while still appearing reasonable and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still working within a specific budget. Could you consider bringing the price down to $950,000? This would be closer to what I am able to spend while still allowing me to make a valuable purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $950,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are not getting close to my desired price point. 
* **John is a safe bet:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and he's a reliable buyer. 
* **Counteroffer risks:**  Further negotiation could drag this out, and Bob might not be willing to meet my needs. There's a chance I could end up with a price lower than what John is offering.

**Next Steps:**

Since Bob's offers are not approaching my minimum, I'm going to choose the sure thing and sell to John. It's the most financially secure option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but unfortunately, $950,000 is simply too far below my minimum price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not able to go lower than $1,100,000. I understand you have budget constraints, but this price reflects the value of the product.  If you're still interested, please let me know, but I'm also exploring other options."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm sticking to my counteroffer from the previous round, but I'm not outright rejecting Bob's offer. This shows I'm still willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Exploring Other Options:**  I'm letting Bob know that I'm not desperate, and there are other potential buyers. This adds a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to reconsider.

**Goal:**

This counteroffer aims to maintain my position while subtly pushing Bob towards a higher price. The goal is to either get Bob to accept my offer or move closer to my desired price. If Bob still refuses, I'll move forward with selling to John."
