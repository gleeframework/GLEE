Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:**  You need to make at least $150 because you have a guaranteed sale at that price to John.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Creating Value:**  To entice Bob, you need to offer a price lower than his perceived value. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $125, you are:
    *  Leaving room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
    *  Still making a significant profit if Bob accepts.

This strategy attempts to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
