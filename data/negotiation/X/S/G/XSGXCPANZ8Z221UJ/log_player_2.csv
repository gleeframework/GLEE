{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $130. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, so you can try to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a good backup option.** If you can't get a better price from Alice, you can always buy from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting with the best price:** I'm offering the maximum price I'm willing to pay. 
* **Testing the waters:** This lets Alice know I'm serious about buying, but I'm not willing to overpay.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** There's still room for Alice to come down a bit, especially if she wants to close the deal quickly."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to my price, it's still above my maximum. 
* **More room for negotiation.** With 7 rounds left, I can continue to try and get a better price.
* **John remains a good option.**  If I can't get Alice to budge, I can still get the product from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer to the middle:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Keeping some wiggle room:** This gives Alice some room to counter without going too low for her.
* **Maintaining my limit:**  I'm still staying below my maximum price of $100."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice is getting closer to my target price:** The offer is only $5 above my maximum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try for a lower price, there's a chance Alice might reject my next offer, and I could lose out on the deal.
* **Time is ticking:** With only 5 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement is increasing.
* **Buying from John is still an option:** If I need to, I can still buy from John for $100. However, it's worth taking this slightly better offer from Alice, especially with limited time."
