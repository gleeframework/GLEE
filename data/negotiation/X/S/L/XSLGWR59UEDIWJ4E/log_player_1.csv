Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, even though I know you have other options."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High, but not ridiculously so:**  While I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, I start higher to leave room for negotiation. $14,000 gives me bargaining space while still potentially being within Bob's acceptable range.
* **Confidence and Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the value proposition to make the price seem more justifiable, even though it's above Bob's perceived value.
* **Alternative Mention:**  Subtly reminding Bob I have other options (John) adds a slight pressure point without being overly aggressive. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts, I get more than my minimum.
2. **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:** His response will indicate how much he's willing to pay.
3. **Control the Negotiation:**  I set the initial price anchor, influencing subsequent offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. His message suggests willingness to compromise (""meet in the middle""). Rejecting now allows me to counter and potentially secure a slightly higher price, even if it's just a bit above $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and finding a middle ground is definitely something I'm open to. How about we settle on $12,800?  This reflects my willingness to be flexible while ensuring the deal is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12800}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):**  I'm coming down from my initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, I'm not dropping directly to his $12,000.
* **Justification:**  I'm framing the price as fair and balanced, not just a concession.
* **Leaving Room:**  The $12,800 price point allows Bob to potentially counter slightly lower (e.g., $12,500) while still getting me a profit above my minimum.

This approach aims to:

1. **Encourage Agreement:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm making it more enticing to close the deal.
2. **Maintain Some Profit Margin:** I'm still striving for a price above my absolute bottom line.
3. **Control the Negotiation Pace:** I'm setting the stage for a potential final round of offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I understand your position, but I would like to keep the price closer to what I initially offered. How about we aim for $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer is a reasonable compromise. Here's why:

* **Solid Profit:** $12,500 is a $500 profit over my minimum acceptable price and a significant gain from his initial offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could try to push for a bit more, it's unlikely Bob will move much higher. Further negotiation risks him walking away entirely.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to haggle delays the sale. Accepting now secures the profit and allows me to move on to other potential deals. 

Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate fairly, and this offer represents a good balance between maximizing my profit and securing a deal."
