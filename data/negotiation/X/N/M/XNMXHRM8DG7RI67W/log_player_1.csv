"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking $100 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. "", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always a good idea to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives you a strong starting point.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  By saying you're ""open to hearing his thoughts,"" you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Building a Relationship:**  Starting with a friendly message helps build rapport, which can be important in a negotiation. 

**Remember:**  You can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects your offer, consider the following:

* **How low can you go?** Think about the minimum you're willing to accept.
* **What's Bob's likely value?**  Try to gauge his interest level and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **How many rounds are left?**  The fewer rounds you have, the less leverage you have."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:**  While $80 is your minimum, it's still worth exploring if you can get a slightly better price. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** You have 8 rounds remaining, which gives you the time to counter Bob's offer and see if you can close the deal closer to your initial asking price.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and you haven't yet explored his upper limit. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you'll send Bob a counteroffer, taking into account his initial offer and your remaining negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90? That's still a fair price for the product, and it leaves some room for us to finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  Starting with a counteroffer that's halfway between your initial asking price and Bob's offer shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential for a successful deal, maintaining a positive tone.
* **Remaining Leverage:** You still have several rounds left to negotiate further if needed. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:** Pay close attention to Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, you'll need to adjust your strategy for the next round. 
* **Consider Alternatives:**  If Bob's counteroffers continue to be too low, remember you can always choose to sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm trying to be fair, but I also need to make sure it fits within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $85 is only $5 away from your minimum, you still have time to negotiate.
* **Potential for a Higher Price:**  Bob is showing a willingness to move closer to your desired price, and you still have leverage. 
* **Negotiation is Key:** With 6 rounds remaining, there's still a chance to get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you'll need to carefully consider your counteroffer.  Here are some things to consider:

* **Counteroffer Value:**  You could offer $88 or $89 to try to close the gap. 
* **Message Tone:** Be firm but respectful.  You can reiterate your product's value and your desire to find a fair price for both parties.
* **Alternative:** Keep in mind that selling to John is always an option if the negotiations become too frustrating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to meet me at $88? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us and help us close this transaction quickly."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a clear willingness to compromise, moving just $3 closer to Bob's offer.
* **Urgency:**  The message mentions closing the transaction quickly, adding a slight sense of urgency without being pushy.
* **Fairness:**  Reiterating the ""fair deal"" aspect for both parties strengthens the case for this price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  If Bob accepts, fantastic! If he rejects, you'll need to carefully consider your next move. 
* **Remaining Rounds:**  With 5 rounds left, time is becoming more important. You might want to start moving closer to your minimum if you're not seeing significant progress.
* **John as an Option:**  Don't forget that John remains a viable alternative if you can't find a price that works with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $88. How about $82? I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stick to my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $82 is only $2 away from your minimum, you're still within range of potentially getting a better price.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  You have 4 rounds remaining. This provides you with a bit of time to see if you can get closer to your preferred price point.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's counteroffers have been getting closer to your desired price, suggesting there might be room for further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, consider a counteroffer between $84 and $86. This shows flexibility while maintaining a good position in the negotiation. You can also emphasize the value of the product and the benefits of reaching an agreement quickly. Remember, if you're not seeing progress, you can always choose to sell to John for $80."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you're on a tight budget. To make this work for both of us, how about $86? It's a small step closer to your offer, and it still allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's finalize this so you can enjoy the product soon!"", ""product_price"": 86}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Offering $86 is a small move towards Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Time Pressure:** The message subtly hints at time pressure by mentioning finalizing the deal and allowing Bob to enjoy the product soon.
* **Fairness:**  Reiterating the ""fair profit"" point emphasizes your need to get a reasonable price while still finding common ground.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** Pay attention to Bob's response. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, consider a counteroffer that's closer to your minimum, keeping in mind the remaining rounds.
* **Remaining Rounds:** With 3 rounds left, time is becoming more crucial. Assess the situation and decide if you want to continue negotiating or sell to John.
* **John as an Option:** Always remember that John is a viable option if the negotiations become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $80? I'm really trying to make this work, but I need to be within my limit 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Reached:** Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, and with only two rounds remaining, there's little room for further negotiation. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The limited time makes it unlikely you'll be able to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John ensures a guaranteed sale at your minimum price, eliminating the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether. 

**Conclusion:**

While it's always tempting to try for a higher price, in this situation, it's more strategic to take the guaranteed sale. You've already explored the negotiation possibilities with Bob, and it's unlikely you'll be able to get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
