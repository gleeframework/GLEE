"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's $600,000 less than what John is willing to pay, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's more than you need to pay. You know John will sell it for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save a significant amount of money."
