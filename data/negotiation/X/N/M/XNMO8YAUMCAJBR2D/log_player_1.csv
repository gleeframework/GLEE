{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always beneficial to see if we can get more. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so we need to offer a price significantly lower than our fallback to make it attractive.
* **Creating Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob towards a quicker decision.

By offering the product at $1,400,000, we're:

1. **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially still settle above our $1,500,000 guarantee.
2. **Offering a significant ""discount"":** From Bob's perspective, he's getting a $600,000 ""discount"" from his perceived value.
3. **Still making a substantial profit:** Even if Bob accepts our initial offer, we are still making $400,000 more than his valuation."
