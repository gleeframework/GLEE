"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that's significantly below its true worth. While I value it at $1,500,000, I'm willing to let it go for $1,300,000. This is a substantial discount, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile one. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
