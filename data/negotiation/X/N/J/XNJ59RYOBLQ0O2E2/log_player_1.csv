Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is far above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, given its potential.  I believe this is a fair offer considering my own valuation and the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,900,000 is still beyond what I'm able to pay. Given my initial offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This shows my sincere interest in this product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering our valuations. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
