"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations and prove to be a worthwhile investment.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is far above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, given its potential.  I believe this is a fair offer considering my own valuation and the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the $850,000 price doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point strikes a better balance between its worth and your initial assessment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,900,000 is still beyond what I'm able to pay. Given my initial offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This shows my sincere interest in this product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering our valuations. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  However, the value I place on it is significantly higher. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This is a firm offer, as it represents a substantial compromise on my end.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I acknowledge your commitment to the product's value, $1,600,000 is still outside my financial constraints. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000, which reflects a significant step towards your proposed price. I believe this demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product.  Let's work together to bridge this remaining gap.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
