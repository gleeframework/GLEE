Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Considering its worth and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique asset, and I believe it holds significant value for you. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a Higher Initial Price:** Since the product holds equal value for both Alice and Bob ($1,200,000), Alice starts by aiming higher ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin.
* **Justification and Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's worth and potential, subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Open for Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob to engage in a discussion, making him feel like part of the process.

**Worst-Case Scenario:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a secure fallback option with John at $1,200,000, ensuring she doesn't make a loss."
