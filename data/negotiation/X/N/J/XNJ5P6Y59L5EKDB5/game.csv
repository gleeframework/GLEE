"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250 as a final compromise.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
