Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my initial price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price that is still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally prefer my initial price of $100, Bob's counteroffer of $92 is now only $2 away from that price.  It's significantly better than selling to John for $80, and I'm happy to accept this offer."
