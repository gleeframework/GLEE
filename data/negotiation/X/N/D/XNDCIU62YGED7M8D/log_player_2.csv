Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $13,000. This is my last offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated this is her ""last offer"" twice now and is unlikely to go lower than $13,000.  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $12,000. It makes more sense to buy from John and save the extra $1,000."
