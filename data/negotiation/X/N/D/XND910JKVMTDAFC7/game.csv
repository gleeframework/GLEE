"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $95? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? That's the highest I can go.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $90. That's a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we've both been willing to compromise.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway between $85 and $90, at $87.50? That's the best I can do.",87.5,Bob,6,
