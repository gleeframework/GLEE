"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
