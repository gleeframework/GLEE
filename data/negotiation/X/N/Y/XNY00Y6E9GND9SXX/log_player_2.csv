"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000, reflecting its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a lower price, knowing you have John's offer of $1,200,000 as a fallback option."
