Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  $800,000 (You'll sell to John at this price if Bob refuses).
* **Bob's Perceived Value:** $1,200,000 (He benefits significantly if he gets the product).
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $800,001 and $1,199,999 works for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA, but avoid being too greedy and risking Bob rejecting your offer.  

**Possible Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000, reflecting its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** By highlighting the product's value to Bob, you set a positive tone.
* **Confident Price:** $1,100,000 leaves you with a significant profit margin while still offering Bob a discount from his perceived value.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong offer, it leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes, giving you further opportunity to maximize your profit.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach. Depending on your negotiation style and any additional information you have about Bob, you might adjust your offer."
