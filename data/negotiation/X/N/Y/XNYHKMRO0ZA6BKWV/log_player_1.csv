Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a small buffer for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a strong fallback position, allowing for a more confident negotiation with Bob."
