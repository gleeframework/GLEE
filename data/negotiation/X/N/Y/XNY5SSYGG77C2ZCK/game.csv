,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $90?  It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I can offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
