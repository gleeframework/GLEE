"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $10,500. It's still a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $9,750? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,750 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $10,200. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations. Let me know what you think!",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $9,900. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $9,900. I'm willing to make one more concession to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $10,100. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations. Let me know what you think!",10100.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price.  Let's make this simple - I can do $10,000. It's my final offer, as I need to move forward soon with one of the options I have.  What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $10,000. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to give up any more value. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $10,250. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know what you think!",10250.0,Alice,9,
