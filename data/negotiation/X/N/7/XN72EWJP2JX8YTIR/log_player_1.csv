Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
 
This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price is $8,000** (because I have a backup buyer in John).
* **Bob values the product at $10,000.** This means he's willing to pay more than my minimum.
* **I want to maximize my profit.**  Offering $9,500 leaves a good margin for Bob while still giving me a profit significantly higher than selling to John. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
