"Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering its unique features and benefits.  Let me know your thoughts.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my expenses. Can you meet me at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12000 is unfortunately below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $15000 for the product.  This is still a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $15000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $13500. Can you consider this offer?",13500.0,Bob,4,
