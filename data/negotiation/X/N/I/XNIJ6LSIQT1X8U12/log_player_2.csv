Bob should reject the offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.

Bob should reject the offer again.  While it's a little closer to his ideal price, there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal. He can likely get Alice down to a price closer to $8,500."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I like the way you think! I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but I can do a little better than that. How about we meet at $8,900? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $8,900 is a good price, and it's likely that further negotiation will just take more time and potentially lead to Alice getting frustrated. It's a better deal than John's, and it's not significantly higher than Bob's ideal price."
