"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $11,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to still make a profit. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll offer you the product for $10,750.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to come to an agreement.  I'm hoping you'll accept this offer, as it's the best I can do.",10750.0,Alice,5,
