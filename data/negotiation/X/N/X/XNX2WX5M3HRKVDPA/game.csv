"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9000, which is a significant discount from my original price. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8750? That's closer to my budget and would be a great deal for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $9200, which is my best and final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",9200.0,Alice,5,
