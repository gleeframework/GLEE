{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  I'm also using friendly language to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Selling to John would result in the same profit, so accepting Bob's offer is the best option."
