Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a fair price for both of us. It's higher than my minimum, but still below the value Bob places on the product. This gives him incentive to accept, while still leaving me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can do better.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm confident I can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counter-offering with $95. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's lower offer while still remaining profitable for me. I'm hopeful he'll accept this price, as it's still well below his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $90, which is very close to my counteroffer of $95. At this point, continuing to negotiate is unlikely to get me a significantly higher price. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit close to what I aimed for."
