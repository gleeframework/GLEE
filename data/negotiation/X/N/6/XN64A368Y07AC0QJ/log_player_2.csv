"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11500. This is a special opportunity to acquire an item that holds significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its true worth while allowing us to reach a fair agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to let it go for $10,500?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and I'm eager to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, I am willing to consider $10800 as a compromise. This price reflects the value of the product while also considering your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,800 is lower than the $12,000 Bob would pay John.  This is a good deal for Bob, as he's saving $1,200.  While there's always the chance he could negotiate even lower, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ending up paying John $12,000 outweighs the potential reward of a few hundred dollar savings."
