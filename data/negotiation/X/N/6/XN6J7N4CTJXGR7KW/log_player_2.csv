"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  $1,200,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000 and a better deal than buying from John.
* **Bob saves money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $300,000 compared to buying from John."
