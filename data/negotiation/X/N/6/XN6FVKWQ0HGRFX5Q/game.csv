"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd like to offer $1100000 for the product.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1150000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1150000.  I'm still a bit above my budget. To make this work, I'd need to come in at $1125000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.  Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1140000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market demand. What do you think?",1140000.0,Alice,5,
