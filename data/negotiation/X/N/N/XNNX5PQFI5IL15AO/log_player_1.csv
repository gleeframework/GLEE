Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000, reflecting its true worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice wants to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation. Offering a price slightly below that maximizes her potential profit.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but Alice has room to go down while still staying above her $1,200,000 minimum. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message projects value and confidence in the product, subtly reinforcing the price justification.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob to be a tough negotiator, she might want to start even higher.
* **Market Factors:** Are there other potential buyers similar to Bob? If so, Alice might be more firm on her price."
