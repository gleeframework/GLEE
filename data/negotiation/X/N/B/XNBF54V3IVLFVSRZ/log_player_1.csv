Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I get a price significantly higher than my minimum value of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is more than my minimum value, it's still lower than my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm countering with $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to be flexible while still aiming for a good price."
