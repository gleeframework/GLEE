Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
 ""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your minimum:** You need to make at least $120 because John will buy it at that price.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd theoretically be willing to pay anything below that. 
* **Maximizing profit:** You want to get as close to $150 as possible without going over, to ensure Bob accepts. 
* **The offer:** $140 leaves some room for negotiation (if needed) while still securing a significant profit for you."
