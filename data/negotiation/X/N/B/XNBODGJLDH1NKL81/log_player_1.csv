Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a truly unique opportunity with immense potential.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Positive messaging:**  My message is friendly and highlights the potential of the product. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $800,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my floor of $800,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  I can likely get a better price by continuing negotiations. 
* **Avoiding immediate sale:** I want to maximize my profit. While selling to John for $800,000 is safe, I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping for a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal work.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:**  I've lowered my price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, this is still above Bob's offer and closer to my ideal outcome.
* **Positive and open language:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and suggesting the possibility of finding a middle ground.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I haven't dropped to my minimum yet, so I still have some bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $950,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I would prefer to sell for closer to $1,000,000, there's a chance Bob might budge slightly higher if I push further. However, there's also the risk that he'll walk away. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale that's significantly higher than selling to John.  The potential gains from further negotiation might not outweigh the risk of losing the deal entirely."
