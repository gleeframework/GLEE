{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary. I've also made the message friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage in a back-and-forth.  

Remember, my goal is to get as much as possible, but I also need to be mindful of the risk of losing the deal.  John's offer is my safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Is there any wiggle room on your end? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While it's tempting to take the $8,000, it's not worth losing a substantial amount.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $8,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
I'm countering with $9,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing good faith, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting his offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations. Selling to John for $10,000 is still an option, but accepting Bob's offer guarantees a quicker transaction."
