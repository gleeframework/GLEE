"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [Product Name] for $11,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than what you can get it for from John ($12,000). By rejecting her offer, you leave open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or ultimately buying it from John for less."
