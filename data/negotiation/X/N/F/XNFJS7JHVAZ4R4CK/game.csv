"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $850000.

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer you the product for $825000.

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775000 and $825000, so I'm proposing a price of $800000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,6,
