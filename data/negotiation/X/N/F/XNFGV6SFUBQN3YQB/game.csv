"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  your asking price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $17,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $17,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,5,
