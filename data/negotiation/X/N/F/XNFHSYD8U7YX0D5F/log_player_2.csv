It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $90."

I'm offering $85. This is a fair price, considering the product is worth $80 to Alice and $100 to me."

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge on her price.  At this point, it's more efficient to just buy from John. While it's not the best price, it's still within my budget and saves me the hassle of further negotiation."
