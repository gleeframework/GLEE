"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value, but I was hoping to keep the price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,500 is already a competitive price. Could you meet me halfway at $13,750?"", ""product_price"": 13750}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

``` 

At this point, Bob is firm on his offer and unlikely to move much higher.  Taking $13,000 is still a profit over John's offer.
