I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is a compromise, still higher than my absolute minimum but significantly lower than my initial offer. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to go any lower, and it seems like he's not going to meet me halfway. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
