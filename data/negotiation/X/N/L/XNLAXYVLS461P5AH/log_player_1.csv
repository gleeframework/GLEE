Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price of $950,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, giving Bob room to negotiate.  

**Why not go higher?** 

* **Unknown value to Bob:**  I have no information on Bob's perceived value of the product. A higher price could scare him off, especially if he's unsure if it's worth it.
* **John's offer:**  While I want to maximize profit, I have a guaranteed buyer in John. This gives me some leverage to be slightly more aggressive with my price to Bob. 

**Next steps:** 

* **Observe Bob's reaction:**  If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome. 
* **Negotiate if needed:**  If Bob rejects, I can counter-offer depending on how strongly he expresses interest. 
* **Fall back on John:** If negotiations fail, I'll accept John's offer and secure my minimum price."
