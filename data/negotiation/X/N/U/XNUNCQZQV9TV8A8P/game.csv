"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. Considering the worth of the product to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a revised price of $1,025,000.

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a better deal, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you a revised price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make it a profitable deal for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
