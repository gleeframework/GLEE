"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $950000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $950000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'd be willing to pay $700000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm not sure I'll be able to find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750000. It's a fair price, considering my initial offer and your previous counteroffer. Let's see if we can close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $775000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $775000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $762500. This would be a fair compromise, considering our previous discussions. What do you think?",762500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $775000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $772500.
