Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $850,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

It's time to cut bait. Alice is very unlikely to go below $850,000, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000. There's no point in risking further negotiation when you have a better offer on the table."
