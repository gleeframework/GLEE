"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the exclusivity of this offer, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum budget and what John is offering.  There's no reason to even attempt a counter-offer in this scenario. Buying from John gets you the product at the best price."
