Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $14,000. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you, and this offer is a great opportunity to acquire it at a favorable price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so there's no risk of losing money. This strengthens our position. 

**Important Note:**  If Bob counters with an offer below $15,000, it's in your best interest to politely decline and proceed with selling to John."
