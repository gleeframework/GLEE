"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$500,000 is a very good price, but there's a chance Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting allows you to explore that possibility and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong negotiating position.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this right away, but it will hopefully force her to consider a lower price in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $400,000 is a good price, I'm still not convinced Alice won't go lower.  I want to see if I can get her closer to my initial counteroffer of $300,000.  There are still several rounds left, so rejecting and counter-offering again is a reasonable strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $350,000.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm serious about getting a good deal.  This number is still significantly lower than Alice's offer, so it gives her room to compromise without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $450,000 is getting closer to my desired price range.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that she'll get frustrated and refuse to budge further.  Additionally, with only 5 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  $450,000 is still a good price, and I'm confident I've saved a significant amount compared to buying from John."
