"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm offering it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.
