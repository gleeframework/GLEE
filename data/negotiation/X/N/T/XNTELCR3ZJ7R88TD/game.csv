"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $13,000. How about we meet at $11,500? I think that's a more reasonable price for me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,500.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,500. I'd be willing to go up to $12,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,6,
