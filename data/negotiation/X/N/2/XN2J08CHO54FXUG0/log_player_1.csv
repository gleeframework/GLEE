**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is offering the same amount as John ($800,000). There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will result in a higher price. It's best to take the sure profit and sell to John.  Continuing with Bob has a risk of a lower offer, and time is a factor in this scenario."
