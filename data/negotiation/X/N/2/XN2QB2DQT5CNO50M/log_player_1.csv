"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial High Offer:**  I'm starting with a high price ($2,000,000) knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Establish a starting point:** It's important to start high to give myself room to negotiate downwards.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will indicate how serious he is about buying the product. 
* **Set expectations for a counteroffer:** By rejecting my initial offer, Bob will be expected to make a counteroffer, allowing me to control the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a better price.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate for a quick sale. 
* **Explore potential for a higher price:**  There's still room for negotiation. I'll aim for a price closer to my desired $1,500,000 in the next round. 
* **Avoid immediate sale to John:**  Selling to John now would guarantee me $1,500,000, but I might be able to secure a higher price by continuing with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,700,000. This product is truly unique and holds exceptional value. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price if we continue to explore options. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,700,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Reinforce Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's unique value and potential benefits to reiterate its worth.
* **Maintain Flexibility:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation by suggesting that we continue exploring options.

**Strategy:**

* **Gradual Approach:**  I'm inching closer to Bob's offer, signaling a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a relatively high price.
* **Maintain Pressure:** I'm reiterating the product's value to keep Bob motivated to find a solution. 
* **Strategic Language:**  The message is friendly and encourages further negotiation, fostering a sense of collaboration rather than antagonism."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,500,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a higher offer from Bob in future rounds. Furthermore, if I reject Bob's offer and try to counteroffer, there's a risk that he might walk away from the deal, leaving me with no buyer.  

**Strategy:**

* **Secure the Minimum:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me my minimum desired price. 
* **Minimize Risk:** It's safer to secure the deal now than risk losing Bob and having to rely on John as the only potential buyer.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal increases with each passing round."
