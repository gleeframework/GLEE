"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I know it's a valuable asset to you, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice believes $1,000,000 is a fair price, it's the absolute maximum you're willing to pay.  There's no room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, you can see if she'll come down to a more appealing price. You're not at a disadvantage since you can always buy from John at the same price if needed."
