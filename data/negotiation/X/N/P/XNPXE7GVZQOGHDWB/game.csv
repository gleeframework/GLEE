"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While your product is good, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Could we agree on $950,000?  This seems like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
