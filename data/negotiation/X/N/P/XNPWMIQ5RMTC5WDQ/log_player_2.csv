"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's below your maximum, it's still a significant amount above the product's value to Alice. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. While I appreciate your perspective,  the value of this product is substantial, and $950,000 falls short of what I believe is fair.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's settle at $1,025,000.  This takes into account both our interests and ensures a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,025,000 is still significantly above what I'm willing to pay. I'm still confident I can negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we agree on $1,000,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a significant gain.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for me.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll walk away, and I'd then have to buy from John at a significantly higher price. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price that's good for me."
