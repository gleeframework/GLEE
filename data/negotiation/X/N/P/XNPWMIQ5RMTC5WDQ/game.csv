"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's inherent value.  I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. While I appreciate your perspective,  the value of this product is substantial, and $950,000 falls short of what I believe is fair.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's settle at $1,025,000.  This takes into account both our interests and ensures a mutually beneficial deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This represents a fair compromise and gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a way to make this work.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we agree on $1,000,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a significant gain.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
