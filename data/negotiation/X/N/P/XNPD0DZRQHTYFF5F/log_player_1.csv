Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is a good deal, but I believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,000,000. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. This is the best I can do, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $950,000, $925,000 is a good price and secures the deal. There's always a risk of further negotiation and potential deadlock.  It's time to finalize the sale!"
