"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I'd like to offer you. It's a high-quality item that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $120, and Alice is offering the product at that price, it's the best option to accept her offer. You're getting the product at your price limit, and you don't need to go through the hassle of buying from John."
