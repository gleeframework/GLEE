"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer stands until [Set a reasonable deadline], after which I'll be moving forward with another interested party. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can leverage the offer from John and potentially negotiate a better price from Alice or secure the product for the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
