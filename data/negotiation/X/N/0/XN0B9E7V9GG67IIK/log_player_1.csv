{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving room for negotiation. The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the conversation. I'm aiming to secure a higher price while still being open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value of $8,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. There's still a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $8,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000?  That way we both get a fair deal, and I can get this product without having to go elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum value. I'm happy to accept it, as it's a fair deal and avoids further negotiation."
