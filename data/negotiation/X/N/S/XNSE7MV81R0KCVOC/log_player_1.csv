"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a decent margin, but I'm also aware that I might have to negotiate lower if Bob is unwilling to pay that much.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to play ball at a higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm not willing to accept that offer. I'll counter with a price closer to my value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm going to stick with my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for further negotiations. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll have to assess whether to lower my price further or sell to John."
