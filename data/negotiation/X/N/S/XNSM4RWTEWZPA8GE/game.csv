"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $850,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  How about $750,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
