"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's definitely worth more than $8,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a great price for a product worth so much to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think!

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to go down to $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. This is still a great deal for a product that's worth so much to you. I'm confident you won't regret this purchase.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to negotiate down to his $8,000 budget, but Alice has only come down to $9,500.  This is still above his limit, and he has reached his negotiation limit.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
