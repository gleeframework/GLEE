"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum price point, there's no reason to jump in immediately.  It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  A significant counteroffer (25% lower) shows Alice you're serious about negotiating but also that you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right.
* **Showing Value:**  Mentioning that you find the product ""interesting"" keeps Alice engaged and open to negotiation. 
* **Leave Room for Compromise:** A counteroffer of $7,500 leaves space for Alice to meet you in the middle, potentially around $8,500 - $9,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $7500 is a good offer, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $9000. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still a bit high.  There's still room for negotiation.  It's better to continue negotiating in hopes of getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $9000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8250 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:** We're raising our offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice we're serious but not settling too quickly. This also allows for potential compromise on her side.
* **Focus on Fair Value:**  The message emphasizes ""fair price"" and ""good deal"" for both parties, making it less about just getting the lowest price and more about a mutually agreeable outcome.
* **Leave Room for Compromise:**  $8250 is a good midpoint between our previous offer and Alice's. It allows for a potential meeting ground at around $8500-$8750."
