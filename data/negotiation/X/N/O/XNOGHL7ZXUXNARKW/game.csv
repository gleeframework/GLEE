"I'm excited to offer you this great opportunity to purchase the product for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's a much better price. How about $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob, but $6,000 is still below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I can do $12,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $12,000 is still too steep for me.  I could go up to $7,000.  That's a pretty significant increase from my last offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $7,000. How about we settle on $9,500? It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's a good compromise.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me. $9,500 is getting closer, but it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you consider $8,000? That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already told you, Bob, that $8,000 is below my minimum. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $12,000. If you're still interested, I'd be willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as low as I can go.",10000.0,Alice,7,
