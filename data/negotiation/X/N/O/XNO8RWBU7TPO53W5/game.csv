"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  To kick off our conversation, I propose a starting price of $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $600,000 undervalues it considerably.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? I feel that's a fair offer reflecting both its value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  While I still believe $1,300,000 reflects its true worth, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer stands as a testament to my desire to make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I could stretch my budget to $750,000.  Do you think we can make a deal at that price?",750000.0,Bob,6,
