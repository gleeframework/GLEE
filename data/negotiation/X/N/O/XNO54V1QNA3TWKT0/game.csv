"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $17,000, so I'll offer $14,500. Can you consider that?",14500.0,Bob,4,
