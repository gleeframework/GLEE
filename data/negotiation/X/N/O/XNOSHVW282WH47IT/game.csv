"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly significant, and $2,300,000 is a fair reflection of that. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. I believe this offer represents a good balance between its intrinsic worth and a price that makes sense for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. However, $2,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
