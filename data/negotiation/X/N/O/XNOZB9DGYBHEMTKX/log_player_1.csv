"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price.  I'm confident the product's worth to Bob justifies this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum price, and I'm not willing to settle for that. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's proposal. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrates the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can do better. I'll counteroffer again in the next round.  I'm not ready to settle for anything less than $1,200,000 yet, and I have John as a backup if negotiations fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm nearing my minimum price. I'm hoping this will tempt Bob into accepting, but I'm also prepared to move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price. I'm satisfied with this deal, and it's better than selling to John."
