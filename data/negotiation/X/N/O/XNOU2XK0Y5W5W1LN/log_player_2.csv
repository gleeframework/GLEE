# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, $1,800,000 represents a significant discount from my initial valuation.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of this product and the potential returns it offers.
