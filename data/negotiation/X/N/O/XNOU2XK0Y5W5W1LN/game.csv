"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,800,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you given its value to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, $1,800,000 represents a significant discount from my initial valuation.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of this product and the potential returns it offers.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want a good price, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant amount and reflects the potential value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
