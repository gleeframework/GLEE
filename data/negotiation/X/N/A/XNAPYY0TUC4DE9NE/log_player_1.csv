Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Space for Counteroffer:**  I'm hoping Bob will counteroffer, but I've given him enough incentive to at least consider my initial offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm always aware of John's offer, so I won't be pressured to accept a price I'm unhappy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $9,000 for the product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my $15,000 minimum.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** I can try to get a better price from Bob by making a counteroffer. This is a negotiation, and I want to maximize my profit.
* **John's Offer is a Backup:** If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can always sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $11,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to benefit from a successful transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Bob's Offer:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer to show willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a Margin:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not giving away the farm.
* **Strong Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the price (value and benefit). 
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still unable to meet you at $11,000. My maximum budget remains at $9,000. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is firm on his $9,000 offer, and I've already reduced my price significantly. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome for me.
* **John's Offer is Superior:**  John is offering me my desired price of $15,000. This is the best possible outcome financially.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will eventually agree to a higher price. By selling to John, I'm locking in a profitable sale with certainty."
