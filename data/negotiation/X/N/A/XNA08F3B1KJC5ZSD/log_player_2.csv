"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get an even better price from Alice.  There's a chance Alice is willing to go lower, especially if she wants to close the deal quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $800,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's still a reasonable offer. This counteroffer tests Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secures a better price for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good compromise.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible.  It's also a significant savings compared to buying from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting the offer secures a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the product."
