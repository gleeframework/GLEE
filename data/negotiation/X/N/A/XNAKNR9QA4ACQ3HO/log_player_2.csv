"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You want to save as much as you can, so rejecting the first offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy.  You are likely to get a better price than $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? I'm sure you'll still find it a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still aiming to save as much as possible. While $132.50 is better than $140, you can likely push for a lower price.  You're willing to pay up to $150 for the product, and you have some room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $132.50 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $130, which is right in the middle. Let's close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 130}
