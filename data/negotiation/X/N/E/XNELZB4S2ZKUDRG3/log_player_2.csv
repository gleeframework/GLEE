# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high.  Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should reject this offer and counter-offer again. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better deal closer to his desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,025,000 is still too high for Bob. He's very close to his budget limit and should counter-offer again. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to budge a bit more to finalize the deal.  The alternative of buying from John for $800,000 is still a better option, but Bob can likely get a better deal than $1,025,000 with a final counter-offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,015,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has negotiated as much as he can with Alice, and the price is still above his target. While Alice is willing to make another concession, it's clear she's not going to go much lower.  The risk of further negotiation is that Alice might actually sell to John for $1,200,000, leaving Bob with no product.  

It's now in Bob's best interest to take the guaranteed deal with John for $800,000. This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further risk."
