Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,500,000.  I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly valuable. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the Value:**  I know the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000) and have a firm minimum price ($1,500,000). 
* **Anchoring:** I start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,900,000). This sets a high anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a good chance I'll land above my minimum.
* **John as Backup:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at my minimum price, giving me leverage in the negotiation. I don't need to be desperate.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob might counter-offer, and I'll need to be prepared to negotiate. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a long-term relationship with Bob is important, I might adjust my approach to be less aggressive."
