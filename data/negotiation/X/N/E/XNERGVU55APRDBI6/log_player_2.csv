"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000, there's room to negotiate and potentially save money. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a profit and me a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  At $1,300,000, Bob is still saving $200,000 compared to buying from John. While there might be a slight chance to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and then having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
