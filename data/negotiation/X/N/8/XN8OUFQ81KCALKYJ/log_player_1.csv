Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is the highest possible price I can offer, as it is the minimum I am willing to accept. If Bob rejects this offer, I will immediately sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject Bob's offer. While it is close to my minimum, I can still potentially get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, as it's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll reconsider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is only $75,000 less than what John is offering.  It's not worth risking losing the sale and potentially getting a lower offer in the next round. I will accept Bob's offer."
