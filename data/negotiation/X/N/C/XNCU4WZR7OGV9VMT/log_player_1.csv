Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit if he accepts.
* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,450,000 is still significantly high, reflecting the product's value to you.  It leaves Bob with a potential $450,000 gain, making it tempting.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.

This strategy balances securing a high profit with a reasonable chance of Bob accepting the offer."
