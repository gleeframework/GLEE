"Bob, I believe this product is a valuable asset for you, given its potential to generate significant returns.  I'm offering it to you for $1000000, a price that allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the pricing. While I value your offer,  $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true potential of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $950000? This price acknowledges your value and still allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to go up to $920000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",920000.0,Bob,4,
