I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and forces her to either accept a lower price or risk losing the deal."

Alice is still above my maximum price, but she's come down a bit. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."

I'm making a final counteroffer at my maximum price. It's a fair offer considering John is willing to sell for the same price. Now it's up to Alice to decide if she wants to close the deal or risk losing it."
