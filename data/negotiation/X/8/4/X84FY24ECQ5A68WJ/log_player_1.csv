Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob is interested in the product, and I'm willing to work with him, but I'm also prepared to walk away and get my desired price from John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but a significant drop from my initial price. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired price, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to reject his offer and make one final counteroffer.  If he doesn't accept this offer, I'll sell to John to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is only $50,000 more than my minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept. If he doesn't, I'll be happy to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally met my minimum price.  While I would have preferred to get a little more, it's not worth risking losing the deal and having to sell to John for the same price.  I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
