Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $825,000. I hope this proposal is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $825,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** This price is still a $25,000 profit over my minimum and John's offer.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging negotiations could lead to losing Bob and potentially missing out on John's offer as well. 
* **Negotiation Trend:**  Bob is clearly willing to move, and it's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer in later rounds."
