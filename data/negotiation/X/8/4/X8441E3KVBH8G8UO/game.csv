"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your asking price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000 to make this a worthwhile deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that should be more acceptable to both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $10,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,5,
