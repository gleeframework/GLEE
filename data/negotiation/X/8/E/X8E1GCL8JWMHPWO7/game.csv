"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with this price. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make, but I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  This would be a significant investment on my part, but I believe in the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
