Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $875,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing the value you place on this product, and I want to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $887,500? This allows me to get closer to my initial target, and still provides you with a great deal."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $887,500, but I'm still just a bit too high for my comfort zone. Let's split the difference and settle at $881,250. This way we both get a bit closer to what we want, and we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $881,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $881,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer is quite close to my desired price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting $881,250 secures a substantial profit above my minimum, and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or walking away."
