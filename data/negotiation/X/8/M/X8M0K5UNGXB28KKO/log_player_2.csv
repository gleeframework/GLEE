Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll counteroffer at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good deal. It's a significant discount from my initial budget of $1,200,000, and it's a good compromise between our previous offers. Accepting this offer will save me $350,000 compared to buying from John."
