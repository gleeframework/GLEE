"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight.  I can offer you $90.  Let's see if we can make this work.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $90 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $95? It's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's try to make this happen.",95.0,Alice,5,
