"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate, especially since you're aiming to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the initial offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong negotiating position. It's unlikely Alice will accept this right away, but it forces her to consider a lower price and start the negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price.  It's likely Alice is willing to come down further, especially since we're still early in the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,150,000. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but I'm still pushing for a good deal. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Alice's latest offer,  hopefully, this will encourage Alice to come down a bit more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is getting close to my target. While I'd prefer a lower price,  we're now halfway through the negotiation process.  Accepting this offer means I can secure the product and save $250,000 compared to buying from John.  There's a risk that I could get a better price if I keep negotiating, but the chances of a significantly lower offer from Alice are becoming slimmer. It's time to weigh the potential for further savings against the risk of losing the deal and having to buy at a higher price from John."
