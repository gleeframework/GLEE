"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a high starting price, reflecting the value of the product to me. It also leaves room for negotiation, which is important as I don't know Bob's valuation. This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest while still aiming for a high profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and has a good chance of being accepted by Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm hopeful that we can reach a deal through further negotiation, especially since I have more rounds available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again, but just slightly. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, while still ensuring I receive a price that's closer to my desired minimum."
