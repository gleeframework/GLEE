Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down from my asking price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:** This ensures you won't lose money on the deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, you can still lower the price slightly to reach an agreement. 

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, based on my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price by counter-offering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price, given the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. After careful consideration, I can offer $1,125,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,125,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too far below my goal. At this point, it's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my needs.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I get the value I want."
