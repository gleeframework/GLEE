"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really like. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice is offering it for $95, which is still more than your ideal price.  Since you can buy it from John for $100, you can reject Alice's offer and save $5."
