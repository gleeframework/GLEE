Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value for the product, but not so high that he'll immediately reject it.  This gives us room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product and am interested in purchasing it. However, I can only afford to pay up to $120 for it. Would that be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

```

Bob is offering the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It's better to sell to him now than risk further negotiation or selling to John for the same price."
