"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to you ($1,500,000).  It's also significantly lower than the product's worth to Alice ($1,000,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  My counteroffer is a good starting point because it's closer to the product's worth to me ($1,500,000) than Alice's initial offer.
* **Room for negotiation:** It also leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise. 
* **Avoiding John:**  It's still cheaper than buying from John, so I'm not sacrificing my goal of saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Better than John:** Alice's offer is significantly cheaper than buying from John, putting me closer to my goal of saving money.
* **Reasonable compromise:** While the price is still higher than Alice's initial offer, it represents a reasonable compromise, meeting halfway between our previous positions. 
* **Time is valuable:** Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice changing her mind or losing time that I could be using elsewhere."
