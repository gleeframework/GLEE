"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140.",140.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,142.0
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $142 for it.",142.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $142 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135.  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the deal.",135.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,139.0
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $139, which is a bit lower than my last offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",139.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $139 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on $135. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now.",135.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,138.0
"I understand you're firm on $135, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway between $135 and $139, which is $137. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",137.0,Alice,7,,
