"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,200. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic value.",10200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price again. I'm still not quite there yet. Would you be willing to accept $9,500? That's a fair compromise, and it's closer to where I can comfortably go.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,
