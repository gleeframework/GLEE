Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  This is a great deal, as it's well below what it's worth to me. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000), but still lower than my minimum ($15,000). This gives Bob room to negotiate, but also indicates that I'm serious about selling.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" for Bob, making it more appealing. 
* **Leaving the door open:** I'm not overly aggressive, allowing for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:**  My goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Negotiation:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I can likely get closer to my desired price by counteroffering. 
* **John's Offer:** While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I'm not desperate. By counteroffering, I might still be able to secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $13,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm emphasizing the speed and ease of closing the deal, creating a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,800? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $12,800 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still too low.  Further negotiation might be possible, but I'm not sure I can get much higher. 
* **John's Offer:** John is willing to pay my minimum, and likely more. This is a secure way to ensure my desired minimum profit.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and might not lead to a significantly better offer.  

It's always good to remember that the potential risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is minimized by John's offer."
