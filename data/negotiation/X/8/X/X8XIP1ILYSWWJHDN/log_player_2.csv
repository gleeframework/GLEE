"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000, considering its quality and potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and your maximum valuation of the product. It makes sense to negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $8,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in a negotiation. It leaves room to gradually increase your offer while staying well below your $12,000 limit.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This low offer will help you understand how much Alice is willing to negotiate. If she completely rejects it, you'll know you need to increase your offer significantly. If she counter-offers, it suggests there's room for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $16,000 is still above your budget and your maximum valuation.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Alice didn't accept your low offer, her counter-offer suggests she's open to negotiation. You can likely get the price down further. 
* **John as Backup:**  Remember, you can always buy from John for $12,000. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $10,000? That's a significant offer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** This counteroffer shows Alice you're serious about negotiating by increasing your offer by a substantial $2,000. 
* **Staying Below Limit:**  The $10,000 offer keeps you well below your $12,000 maximum and gives you some bargaining room.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help you gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's willing to go lower than $16,000, you might be able to reach a deal. If not, you're still in a good position to walk away and go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, and I understand you're trying to find a fair price.  To be honest, $10,000 is too low for me to consider. However, I'm willing to make a significant move to close this deal.  Would you consider $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer, But Still Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to your budget, but it's still above your $12,000 limit.
* **Leverage of John's Offer:** You have the option to buy from John for $12,000, giving you a strong bargaining position.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, dropping her price from $16,000 to $14,000. There's a chance she might be willing to go lower still."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, my absolute limit is $11,000.  If you're okay with that, we have a deal. If not, I completely understand, but I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counter-offer conveys that you're serious about buying but have a firm budget. 
* **Slightly Above John's Offer:** Offering $11,000 is slightly above what John is offering, showing Alice you're willing to pay a premium for a deal with her.
* **Introducing a Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other options"" subtly lets Alice know that you're not afraid to walk away from the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your limit. I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be fair to myself as well. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,500? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Firm:** Her language (""final offer"") suggests she's unlikely to budge further.
* **Above Budget:**  Even with her compromise, $12,500 is still above your $12,000 maximum.
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $12,000.  

It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John.  You've negotiated well, but sometimes the best outcome is knowing when to walk away."
