"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm asking for $170 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'd like to reject the offer. The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is asking for $170, which is too expensive. I'll look elsewhere.
