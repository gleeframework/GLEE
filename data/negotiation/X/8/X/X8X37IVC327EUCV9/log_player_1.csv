Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm asking for $170 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 170
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay significantly more. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $170 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly highlights the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more amenable to a higher price.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John for $120. It's a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale."
