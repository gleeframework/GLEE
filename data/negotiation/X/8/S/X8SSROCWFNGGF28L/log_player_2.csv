Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you at $85, which is a fair compromise. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85. Since you can get the product for $80 from John, it makes more sense to cut your losses with Alice and buy from John."
