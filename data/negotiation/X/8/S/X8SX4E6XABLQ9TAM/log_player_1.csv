Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential benefit, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a price higher than your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In reality, multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers would likely occur."
