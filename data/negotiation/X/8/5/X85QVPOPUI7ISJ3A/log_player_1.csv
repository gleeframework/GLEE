Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it provides significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to, but still ensures a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't have to go below that price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale."
