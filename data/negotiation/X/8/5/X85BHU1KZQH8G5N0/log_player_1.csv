Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high point, aiming to secure a good price. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm raising the price slightly to $950,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about getting a price closer to my desired range, but it also demonstrates a willingness to compromise. Let's see if this gets us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm willing to accept $925,000 as a fair price."
