"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it."", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 
This is a starting point in the negotiation. I'm aiming significantly lower than my actual maximum price to give room for negotiation and try to get a great deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but she's still significantly above my target price. I'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $7,000?  I think that's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer, but staying well below her current price. This leaves room for further negotiation while still pushing for a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is still a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

This is getting close.  Alice is now only $500 above my alternative, so it might be time to signal I'm close to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $8,500 is very tempting, but to be honest, my absolute top price is $7,500.  If you can do that, we have a deal."", 
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

This does several things:

* **Signals a hard limit:**  By saying ""absolute top price"" I'm letting Alice know I'm not budging much from this point.
* **Keeps some room:** While close to my $8,000 alternative, there's a chance Alice will split the difference for a quick sale.
* **Maintains a positive tone:** I don't want to sound demanding, as that could derail the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,500 is your absolute top price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,500. I can offer it to you for $8,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met my maximum price!  There's no point in rejecting and risking her going higher, or in going to John when I can get the same price from Alice. This closes the deal successfully."
