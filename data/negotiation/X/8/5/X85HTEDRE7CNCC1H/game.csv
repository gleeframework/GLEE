"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $7,000?  I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $8,500 is very tempting, but to be honest, my absolute top price is $7,500.  If you can do that, we have a deal.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is your absolute top price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,500. I can offer it to you for $8,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",8000.0,Alice,7,
