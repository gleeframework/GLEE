"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I have to make a living too. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $16000 to make this deal worthwhile. How about we meet at $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can we try $13500? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, I've already made a significant concession by meeting you at $14000 in the previous round. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to make at least $16000 to make this deal worthwhile. How about we meet at $14500?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I've already made a significant concession by being willing to pay $13500. I'm not willing to go above that price. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I've already made significant concessions and I'm still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $14000. I'm willing to meet you at $13500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,8,
