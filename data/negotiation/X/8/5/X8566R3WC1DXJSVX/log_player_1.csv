I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit greater than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I'll be closely watching Bob's reaction and adjusting my strategy based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable value, but shows I'm willing to negotiate. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, hopefully encouraging Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.  While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk going back and forth for much longer. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000."
