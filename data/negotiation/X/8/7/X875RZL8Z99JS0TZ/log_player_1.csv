"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $150. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I can sell the product to John for the same amount without further negotiation. This saves time and potential haggling."
