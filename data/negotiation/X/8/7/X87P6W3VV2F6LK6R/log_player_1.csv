Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit well above your $10,000 floor.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob knows the product is worth $15,000 to him, so there's room for him to counter and for you to potentially meet in the middle.
* **It shows you're serious:**  A lower initial offer might make Bob think you're not truly interested in selling to him. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is still a decent profit, there's room to push for a better deal.  Bob recognizes the value of the product, so it's worth seeing if we can get closer to our initial offer.  We'll counter with a price closer to our desired amount and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $12,750?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12750} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:**  We're not sticking to our initial offer rigidly, showing flexibility.
* **Is a reasonable compromise:**  We're only $750 above Bob's offer, indicating we're serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Still profitable for us:** This price is still well above our minimum, ensuring a healthy profit. 

Let's see if Bob is ready to close the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get a higher price, Bob is not willing to come up much further.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to move on and secure the sale."
