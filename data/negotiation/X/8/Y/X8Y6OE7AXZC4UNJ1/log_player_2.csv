"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a steal for something worth that much to you.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be moving on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice knows the product is valuable to you and her opening offer leaves you no room for savings.  By rejecting her offer, you force her to either lower the price or risk losing the sale. You have a backup option with John at the same price, so there's no immediate risk in rejecting Alice's initial offer."
