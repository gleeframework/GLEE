"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset that will benefit your business. As we're just starting our negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiations. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. Could we work something closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, Alice.  To be honest, anything above $900,000 is going to be a hard sell for me. Would you be willing to come down a little more?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth $1,000,000 to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
