Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me a good margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob.  I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $80 if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $85 is close enough to my minimum that it's worth accepting. It's better than selling to John for $80, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a wasted effort."
