Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

You've already offered $105, and Alice rejected it. This time, you're increasing your offer slightly to $110, showing that you're willing to compromise but also that you won't budge too much. This approach keeps the negotiations moving while keeping you within your price limit."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still too high. You're aiming to get the product for under $120, and you have more rounds to try.  While you could buy from John at $150, you're determined to get a better deal through negotiation with Alice."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still too high, you are getting closer to a deal. Since there are only a few rounds left, you want to keep negotiating. If you reject the offer, you can make a final counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. You are close to your target price range, and you don't want to give up on the negotiation just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers have been consistently higher than your desired price point.  You're now willing to meet her halfway at $120.  This is your final offer, and you're hoping Alice will accept it. If she rejects it, you'll have no choice but to buy from John."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is higher than your target price and leaves very little room for negotiation. You only have one round left.  While you'd prefer to buy from Alice, it's not worth risking not getting the product at all.  You're better off buying from John for $150 to ensure you get the product within your budget."
