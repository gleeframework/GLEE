"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to the value of the product for me.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product holds significant value for you.  How about we settle on $975,000? That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $975,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, at $1,012,500. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal, but it's the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle this at an even $1,000,000? That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
