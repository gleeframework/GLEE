"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is still a significant discount from what it's worth to me. I believe this is a fair compromise, and it gives you a good value for the product. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $650,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $725,000? This would give you a good price, and allow me to move forward with the sale. Let me know your thoughts.",725000.0,Alice,5,
