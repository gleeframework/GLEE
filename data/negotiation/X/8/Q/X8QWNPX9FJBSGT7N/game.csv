"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $7,000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider that price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable selling at $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,750. It's a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",7750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $7,750 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $7,250.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to secure the product within my budget.",7250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable selling at $7,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $7,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",7500.0,Alice,5,
