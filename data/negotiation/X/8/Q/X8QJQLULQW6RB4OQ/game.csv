"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I need to make a significant profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than $700,000. What are your thoughts?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This represents a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make a profit. Can we discuss this further?",750000.0,Bob,4,
