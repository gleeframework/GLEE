"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1800000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1400000. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1600000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
