Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $130.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $130. This is a compromise between my minimum value ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($120). It gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to earn more than I would from John.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and highlighting that I'm willing to negotiate.  This approach can help build rapport with Bob and encourage him to accept the offer."
