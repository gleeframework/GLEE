Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,150,000 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer and reflects the value I see in your product. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer would result in a lower profit than selling to John.  It's time to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
