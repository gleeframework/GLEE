"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate, especially since Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum price. You can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price that's about 2/3 of Alice's original offer. This gives us room to negotiate while still leaving a significant amount of profit for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is a good price, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm going to try and negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith, but still staying below Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,200 is a good price, I'm still aiming to save a little more. Let's see if I can push Alice a bit lower with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800}
```

I'm going to inch up my offer again, demonstrating flexibility and showing I'm serious about buying the product. This should hopefully get us closer to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $8,100 is within my price range and a significant savings from my initial maximum of $15,000. It's also a reasonable compromise considering the back-and-forth negotiations. While I could try to haggle further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price is too high."
