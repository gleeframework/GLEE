"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we settle on $9,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $9,000 is a fair price based on my budget. However, if you're willing to meet me halfway, I'd be open to discussing a price of $9,250. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9250.0,Bob,4,
