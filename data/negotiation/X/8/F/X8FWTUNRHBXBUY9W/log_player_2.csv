"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal compared to John's $1,000,000 offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice values the product at $800,000, meaning there's potential to get a lower price. By rejecting the initial offer, Bob can try to secure a price closer to Alice's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is halfway between Alice's value of $800,000 and the initial offer of $900,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  It shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also that he's willing to push for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer is higher than her previous offer and closer to John's price. However,  it's still a better deal than John's offer.  Bob should continue negotiating to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again offering a price that is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows that Bob is willing to compromise, but also that he is not willing to pay Alice's asking price.  This price also keeps some space for potential negotiation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $918,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $918,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily increasing her offer, getting closer to John's price.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are minimal.  It's more beneficial to accept John's offer and avoid the risk of Alice continuing to increase her price."
