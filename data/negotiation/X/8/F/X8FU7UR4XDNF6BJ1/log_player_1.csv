Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still exceeding our minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially getting us closer to $120.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency (""limited time"") might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. If he rejects the offer, we have the safety net of selling to John for our minimum price."
