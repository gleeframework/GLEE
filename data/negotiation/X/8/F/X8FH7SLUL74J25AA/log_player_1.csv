{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to make a deal with you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a high price, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a profit greater than $100. I'm also being friendly and hoping to build rapport to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum value. I will counter Bob's offer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm confident this product is worth that much to you."", ""product_price"": 130}
