"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would give us both a good deal, and I'm still willing to negotiate.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to agree on a price of $11,500 for the product? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11,500 is still quite a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to keep the cost closer to my budget. Would you consider $12,000 as a fair compromise?",12000.0,Bob,6,
