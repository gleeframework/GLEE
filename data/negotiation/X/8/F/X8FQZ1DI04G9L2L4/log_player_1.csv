{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. By offering a lower price than what I value the product at, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would give us both a good deal, and I'm still willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to agree on a price of $11,500 for the product? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can push for a higher price.  I'm not willing to settle for anything significantly lower than my minimum, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11,500 is still quite a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to keep the cost closer to my budget. Would you consider $12,000 as a fair compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is the best offer Bob has given so far, and it's getting close to my minimum.  While I would prefer $12,500, I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and having to settle with John for a lower price."
