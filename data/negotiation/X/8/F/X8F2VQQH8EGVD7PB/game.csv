"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to your price point, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
