"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can save $500 by negotiating with Alice, so it's worth rejecting the first offer and trying to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $7,250. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's counteroffer of $7,250 is a good deal for Bob. He can save $750 compared to buying from John. It's likely that further negotiation might get a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and the potential for a longer negotiation is not worth the potential small saving."
