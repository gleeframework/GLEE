"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $10,000? That feels like a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more in the $10,500 range. Would you be open to that?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price down to $10,500, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for sticking with me on this. I know we're getting close. What if we split the difference and land at $11,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm still not ready to give up on getting a better price. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $11,100. This is the last time I'll move on the price, so I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",11100.0,Alice,7,
