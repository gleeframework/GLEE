"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth $12,000. We're confident this investment will pay off greatly for you. Let's discuss how we can make this opportunity work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $12,000, and John is selling the product for exactly that price, it's the most logical choice.  There's no need to negotiate with Alice if you can get the product at your desired price from another seller."
