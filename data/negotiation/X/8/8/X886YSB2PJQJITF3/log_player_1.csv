Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's lower than Bob's perceived value but higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90? That's still a good price for you, and it fits my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than $80, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $100.  How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
