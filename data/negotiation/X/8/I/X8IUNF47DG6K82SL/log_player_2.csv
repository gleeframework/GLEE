"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to me.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $13,000 is still too high for him. He wants to save as much as possible and can get it for $8,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his target, he can still get the product for $8,000 from John. He should keep negotiating with Alice and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $10,500. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than what John is offering. Given that John's offer is within Bob's budget and represents a significant savings, it makes more sense for Bob to go with the more favorable deal and secure the product for $8,000."
