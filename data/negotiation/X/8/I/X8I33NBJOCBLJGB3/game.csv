"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a budget in mind, Bob, but I'm afraid the product's value is much higher than $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $1200000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1400000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I still think you're undervaluing the product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to think about my next move. Let's try $1600000. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the bottom of the barrel, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000, but I'm willing to meet you at $1500000 is too high for me now. Let's try $1400000 is still too high, so let's try $1350000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to find a sweet spot, but I'm still thinking that we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're in a bit of a stalemate, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000, but I'm willing to make one last concession. Let's try $1300000, but this is my final offer. I'm not willing to go any lower.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not willing to go above $1200000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm not willing to budge any further. I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,10,
