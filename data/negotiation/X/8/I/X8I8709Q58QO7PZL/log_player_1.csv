Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I know it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for Bob, highlighting the value he'll receive. 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm not going for the maximum price immediately.  I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  
* $12,000 is a good starting point as it allows for some back-and-forth without me needing to go too low. 
* My floor price is $15,000 (John's offer). If Bob won't go higher than $12,000, I can simply accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $15,000. While it's tempting to take $10,000, I'm not willing to settle for less. 

**Reasoning:**

* I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000. 
* There's still potential to negotiate with Bob and get closer to my desired price. 
* By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and see if he's willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $11,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $12,000, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $10,000.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price and my final offer. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept.

**Reasoning:**

* I'm trying to find a middle ground between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. 
*  $11,500 is a good compromise that still allows for a decent profit for me.
* By stating it's my final offer, I'm hoping to push Bob to accept rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,000 for the product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to go lower than that.

**Reasoning:**

* I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay me $15,000.
* Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a higher price.
*  It's not worth the risk of losing time and potentially losing John as a buyer."
