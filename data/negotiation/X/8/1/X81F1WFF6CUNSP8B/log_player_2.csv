"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I think you'll really appreciate the quality and benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than your maximum price and more expensive than buying from John. You can save $2,000 by going with John."
