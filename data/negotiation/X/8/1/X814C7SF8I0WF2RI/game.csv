"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $750000 is still a bit below my target price.

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $840000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",840000.0,Alice,5,
