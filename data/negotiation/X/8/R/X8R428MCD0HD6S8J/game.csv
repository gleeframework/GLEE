"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you think the product is valuable to you, but I'm not sure I'm willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $950000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $950000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're running out of time, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any lower, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm at my limit. I'm afraid I'll have to stick to my previous offer of $1000000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for the full $1000000.",1000000.0,Alice,9,
