"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",145.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $145 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $130 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $137? It's still a good deal for both of us.",137.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $137 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $133.  This would give us both a good deal. What do you think?",133.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $133 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $135.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",135.0,Alice,5,
