I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it?,110.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,105.0
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $110. How about $102.50?",102.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $102.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $98.75? I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",98.75,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,105.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet in the middle between $98.75 and $102.50? That would be $100.625, but I can round down to $100.50. What do you think?",100.5,Alice,5,,
