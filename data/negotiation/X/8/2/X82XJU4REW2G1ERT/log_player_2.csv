"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would greatly benefit and enhance your endeavors. This product holds immense value to me, but I am confident it can be even more valuable to someone like yourself who can truly appreciate its potential.

I am offering you the chance to purchase this product at a special price of $1,100,000. This represents a significant saving compared to its true worth, which I estimate to be around $1,200,000, making it an exceptional deal for you. I trust that the product's capabilities and benefits align well with your needs and goals, potentially offering you a return on investment that far exceeds the initial cost.

Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. I am looking forward to the possibility of working together and seeing this product contribute to your success.

Best regards,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John at $1,200,000.  There's a chance you can get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. Alice might be bluffing about the product's true worth to you."
