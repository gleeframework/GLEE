"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's make this happen!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget in mind. Could we agree on $7,750? It's a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you have a budget, but $7,750 is still below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's a fair compromise, and a good deal for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $8,000?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,6,
