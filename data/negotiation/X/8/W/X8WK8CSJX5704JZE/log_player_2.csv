"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $11,000 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product,  $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his ideal value of $8,000, but knows he needs to be realistic.  By offering $9,500, Bob demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further bargaining. This counteroffer also keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $9,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,250 is a significant step down from her initial price of $11,000 and brings the price closer to Bob's desired range. While Bob might prefer a lower price, accepting this offer still allows him to save $1,750 compared to buying from John.  At this point,  further negotiation might not result in a much lower price and the risk of losing the deal to John is high.  It's a good compromise that achieves Bob's goal of saving money."
