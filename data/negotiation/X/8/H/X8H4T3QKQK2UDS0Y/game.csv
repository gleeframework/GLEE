"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a fair price. How does $12,000 sound?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I need.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to come down a little more to $10,250. That's a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's close this deal! ",10250.0,Alice,5,
