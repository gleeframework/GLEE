"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your confidence in the product, but $16,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $14,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $15,500 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $15,250 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.",15250.0,Bob,4,
