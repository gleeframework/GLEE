Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, you can afford to start with a high offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Target Above Bob's Value:** Offering the product at $20,000 aims to maximize your profit. Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a chance of securing a price significantly higher than $15,000. 
* **Keep it Simple:** A straightforward message avoids revealing too much information and keeps the focus on Bob's potential interest.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob might reject an offer above $8,000. However, the potential for a higher profit justifies the risk in this scenario."
