Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I think I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll see what counteroffer I can get from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $13,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  It's a decent profit margin and it avoids the hassle of dealing with more counteroffers."
