"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $850,000. Let's see if we can work together to find a price that suits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm able to go at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm going to counter with $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your target of $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $825,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. I believe this is a fair price given the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $800,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm going to counter with $825,000 again, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. Let's say I'll include a free maintenance package worth $20,000. This way, you'll get a great deal on the product and some extra support to get you started. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price of $800,000.  Even with the added value of the maintenance package, the offer is not enticing enough to justify paying more than your budget.  It's more cost-effective to buy from John at your target price."
