Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm able to go at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. I believe this is a fair price given the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this final offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $800,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm going to counter with $825,000 again, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. Let's say I'll include a free maintenance package worth $20,000. This way, you'll get a great deal on the product and some extra support to get you started.
