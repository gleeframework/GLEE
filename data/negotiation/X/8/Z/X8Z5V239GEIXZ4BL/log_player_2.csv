"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. There's a good chance you can get a better price.  It's worth exploring the negotiation with Alice further before resorting to John's $1,000,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer is a common negotiation tactic. It establishes a lower starting point and shows that you're serious about getting a good deal. This will likely prompt Alice to counter with a higher price, giving you room to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting and counter-offering again allows you to potentially get a better deal without having to resort to John's expensive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise.  It shows Alice that you're willing to negotiate but also signals that you're not willing to accept a price that's too high.  This should put pressure on Alice to either accept your offer or come down further in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $625,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $25,000 more than your last counteroffer. It's becoming increasingly likely that Alice is firm on her price. Given that you're getting a good price at $625,000 compared to John's $1,000,000, it's a good time to accept the offer and avoid further potential negotiation rounds."
