"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider this price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair price for such a great product.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $145. Would you be willing to go down to $130? I think that's a more reasonable price for the product.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower but $130 is still too low for me. How about $140? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for such a fantastic product.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $140, which would be $135. Can you consider that?",135.0,Bob,6,
