"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a price that more accurately reflects the true value of this product. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to lower my price to $1,112,500. This would give us both a good deal and allow us to move forward with the transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",1112500.0,Alice,3,
