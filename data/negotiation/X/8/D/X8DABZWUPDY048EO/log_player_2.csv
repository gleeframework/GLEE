How about $1,325,000? This is a small compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for you. Let me know what you think.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's not his ideal price, it's still a good deal.  He can save $25,000 compared to buying from John, and he's likely to be able to negotiate a lower price if he continues to reject offers."
