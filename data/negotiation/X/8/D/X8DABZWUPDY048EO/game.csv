"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,250,000 for the product. That's still a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and gives you a strong profit. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still gives you a good deal and ensures a fair profit for me. Let's see if we can agree on this figure.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within budget and you to still make a significant profit.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  $1,300,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still aiming for a bit more to ensure a reasonable profit. How about $1,325,000? This is a small compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for you. Let me know what you think.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
