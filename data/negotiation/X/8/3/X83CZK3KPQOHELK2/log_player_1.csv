Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique and lucrative investment opportunity for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This would still give you a decent profit and allow me to make a worthwhile investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and I believe the product's value to you is worth the investment. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
