"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique and lucrative investment opportunity for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This would still give you a decent profit and allow me to make a worthwhile investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and I believe the product's value to you is worth the investment. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000. This is a good price for Bob, as it's well below his maximum price of $1,000,000.  While there might be a chance to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price is too high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids potential delays or complications."
