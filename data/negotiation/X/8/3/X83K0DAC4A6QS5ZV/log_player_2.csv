{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $800,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and shows my seriousness about buying the product but sets a clear limit.  It's likely Alice will counter, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,750,000 is still above my budget.  There's room for more negotiation. I'll reject the offer and see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $800,000 to $1,000,000. This shows willingness to compromise while still staying within a reasonable range.  It's a middle ground that might be more appealing to Alice than my previous offer and pushes the negotiation further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,600,000 is a lower offer than before, it's still outside my budget. I'm determined to get the product for as close to $800,000 as possible.  I'll reject this offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $1,200,000. This shows continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still firmly pushing towards my target price. This middle ground might be more tempting to Alice than the last offer, and it keeps us moving closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to my target price, I'm still determined to get it closer to $800,000 if possible. I'll reject the offer and see if we can reach a better price. The deal is getting closer, but I'm not ready to accept anything above my budget yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,300,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm serious about reaching a deal. However, it's still below Alice's offer, and I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my target price. With only a few rounds left, it's time to get close to a deal, but I'm not ready to accept anything above my budget."
