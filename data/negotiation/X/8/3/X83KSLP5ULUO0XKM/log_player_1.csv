Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  This is my top price, as I can purchase the same product from John for that amount.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hesitant to go above $9,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.
