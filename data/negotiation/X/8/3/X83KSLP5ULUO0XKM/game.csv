"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  This is my top price, as I can purchase the same product from John for that amount.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is quite low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and its value to me.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that's closer to our respective values, and I hope you'll consider it.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you a price of $11,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our values, and I hope you'll consider it.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hesitant to go above $9,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. ",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $11,500. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product and the value I place on it.",11500.0,Alice,7,
