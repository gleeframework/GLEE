I'm starting with an offer of $1,250,000.  This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit over my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident I can get a higher price, but I want to see how Bob reacts first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I won't accept it.  I'll counter with a higher price, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,150,000. This is a compromise, coming closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a reasonable profit for me. I believe this price is fair and will likely entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to waste more time.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's the best option for me at this point."
