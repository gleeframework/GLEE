"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $13,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my desired outcome, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly opening makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **Highlighting value:** Mentioning the product's value reinforces its desirability.
* **Room for negotiation:** Leaving space for Bob to counter allows for a more collaborative process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Could you consider meeting me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $10,000. I want to see if I can squeeze out a better price.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  I have 10 rounds, so there's time to keep negotiating.
* **Potential for a higher price:** Bob is clearly interested, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000,  which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value reinforces the rationale behind the price.
* **Collaborative approach:** Emphasizing finding a solution that works for both of us creates a more positive negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $11,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum price of $10,000.
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  If I keep rejecting offers, I risk Bob getting frustrated and walking away, leaving me with only the $10,000 option from John.
* **Opportunity cost:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and move on.

**It's important to note that this is a calculated risk. If I had more time or if Bob was showing stronger signs of willingness to pay more, I might have continued negotiating.**"
