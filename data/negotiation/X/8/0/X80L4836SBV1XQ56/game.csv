"Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a product that I believe would significantly enhance your business operations or personal endeavors. Given its value to you, I understand it's worth $15000 to you. My offer to you is to purchase this product at a price of $12000. This represents a fair compromise between the value you see in the product and my valuation, while also allowing me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I look forward to your consideration of this offer.",12000.0,Alice,1,
