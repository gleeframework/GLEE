"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant price reduction for a product worth much more to me.  It's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a price that's still below its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This still allows me to make a significant profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further. You can potentially get a better deal by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This would provide you with a substantial profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential for a quick sale.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I value your persistence and appreciate your offer.  However, $1,000,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go below $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the opportunity for a quick sale.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but $1,100,000 is still outside your maximum budget of $800,000. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of going over your budget increases. 

It's a better strategy to buy from John at $800,000, ensuring you stay within your financial limits and secure the product."
