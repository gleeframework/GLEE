"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,800,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while staying within my financial constraints.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  While I'm confident in the product's value at my initial asking price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $2,050,000?",2050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to accept $2,050,000. Could we possibly discuss a price closer to $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to stay above $1,900,000 for this to make sense for me.  Would you be willing to meet at $1,975,000?",1975000.0,Alice,5,
