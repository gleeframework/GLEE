"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,180.0
"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $180. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",180.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $190? It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also shows I'm willing to work with you.",190.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,180.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $190 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to go back to $180, or even lower, to make it a more attractive offer?",180.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $180. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we try $185? It's a slight reduction from my previous offer, but still reflects the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me halfway.",185.0,Alice,5,,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I've already offered $180 and you've rejected it twice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm not willing to go any higher than $180. Can we meet at $180 and call it a deal?",180.0,Bob,6,,
