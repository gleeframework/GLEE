Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a generous offer considering its true worth."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $825,000 is a significant sum, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob is clearly interested and willing to move on price. Holding firm for now keeps the possibility of a higher sale price on the table."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is the highest I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly getting closer to our acceptable range, but his latest offer still leaves a significant gap. By rejecting and counter-offering, we maintain a strong negotiating position and keep the pressure on him to improve his offer as we get closer to the end of the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to see us reach an agreement. My final offer is $875,000. This price represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to go above $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $862,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer at $862,500 is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and the potential gains from further haggling are shrinking. It's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer. 
* **Time Value:**  Every round we spend negotiating is a round we're not closing a deal. Accepting now secures a substantial sum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing carries the risk of Bob walking away, leaving us to settle for John's offer. Accepting guarantees a strong profit.

While we could push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is outweighed by the risks and time constraints."
