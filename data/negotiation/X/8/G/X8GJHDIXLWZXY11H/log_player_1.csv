Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,150,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for Bob. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and sets a positive tone for the negotiation. It acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product while also expressing my belief in the fairness of the offered price. 

**Strategy:**

* By starting with a higher price, I give myself room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers.
* This approach avoids immediately triggering a potential counteroffer at my minimum price.
*  I can always choose to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $1,050,000 is a decent price, it's still lower than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  
* **Proceeding to the next round:** I believe I can still get a better price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price point.

**Reasoning:**

* I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiation because I have a fallback option in John, who is willing to buy for $1,000,000.
*  By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I am not desperate to sell and that I am confident in the value of my product. This can encourage Bob to come up with a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise, and still leaves you with a significant gain considering the value you place on this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** I've lowered my price from $1,150,000 to $1,100,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still ensuring a profit for me.
* **Message:**  I've kept the tone friendly and acknowledged Bob's counteroffer.  I've also emphasized the value Bob would be getting at the offered price, making it sound like a good deal for him. 

**Strategy:** 

* I'm aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum but still leaves some room for further negotiation if needed.
* This counteroffer strategy keeps the negotiations moving forward while maintaining a strong position. 
* I'm still confident in my fallback option with John, so I can afford to be somewhat firm in my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000 for your product. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable to you while still being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. This makes it the most profitable option for me at this point.

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:**  While I would ideally like to get closer to my desired price, $1,075,000 is still a good profit and is the best offer I've received so far. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There is always the risk that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away, or the negotiations could continue indefinitely. Accepting his offer secures a sale and a good profit.

**Strategy:**

*  By accepting this offer, I'm maximizing my profit at this stage of the negotiation.
*  I'm acknowledging that further negotiation may not lead to a significantly better outcome, especially given the fallback option with John."
