,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $17,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
