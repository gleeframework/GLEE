Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your operations.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aim for a price that captures the most value between your minimum and Bob's valuation.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $925,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but still secures a significant profit for you. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly highlights the product's benefits, justifying the high price.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
