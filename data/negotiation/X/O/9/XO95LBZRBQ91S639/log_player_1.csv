{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also provides a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher price. Remember, I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price.  While I'm open to negotiating, I won't accept such a drastic drop. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still allows for a good profit for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm proposing a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still protects my minimum price.  We'll see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $950000. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm going to reject his offer and try one more counteroffer. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement, but if not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 just isn't enough for me. Let's split the difference one last time. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll be moving on.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This is my final offer, and it's the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'm trying to be as fair as possible, but I need to ensure I get a reasonable price for my product. If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $990000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm going to sell the product to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price and ensure I get a good deal."
