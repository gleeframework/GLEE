"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This price still allows for a good profit for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950000 just isn't enough for me. Let's split the difference one last time. I'm willing to accept $1000000. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll be moving on.  Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
