"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum. This should encourage him to consider the offer and potentially counter-offer, allowing for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $9,500? This price is still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John for $12,000. I'm confident that I can still make a reasonable profit with this offer."
