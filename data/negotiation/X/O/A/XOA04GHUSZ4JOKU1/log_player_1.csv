Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $140 is higher than your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $140 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), giving him a reason to consider buying. 

This strategy aims to create a negotiation where both of you can potentially benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $140 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $130 is still above your minimum selling price of $120. Accepting his offer means you will earn a profit, and it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only lead to more back and forth, potentially decreasing your potential profit."
