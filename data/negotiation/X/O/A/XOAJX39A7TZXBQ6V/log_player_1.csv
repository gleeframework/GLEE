Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price, while still exceeding my minimum value of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm countering with $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, aiming to reach a middle ground that is still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I would prefer a higher price, $110 is still above my minimum value of $100 and a decent compromise with Bob. There's a risk of further negotiation going lower, and I want to avoid the chance of getting stuck with $100 from John."
