{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** $120 is still a significant profit for me, while leaving space for Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly tone may encourage Bob to engage in a more positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $90 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:** I can likely still get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Potential for Better Outcome:**  Even if Bob rejects my counteroffer, I have the option to sell to John for $150, which guarantees my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price from $120 to $105. 
* **Still Profitable:**  $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still unable to meet at $105. I would like to propose $95 as my maximum offer. I hope this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $95 is close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Time is Money:**  Further negotiation with Bob could potentially drag on, costing me time and opportunity.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is my minimum acceptable value and secures a profitable outcome."
