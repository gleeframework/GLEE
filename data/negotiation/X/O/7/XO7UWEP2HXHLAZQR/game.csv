"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great value at the right price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, considering it's a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I can reasonably afford right now. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. I'm thinking of a price of $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can agree on this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
