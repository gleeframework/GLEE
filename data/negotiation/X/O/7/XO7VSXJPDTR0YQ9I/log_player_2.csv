Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,750,000 is more than his budget of $1,000,000, and it's worth negotiating further to see if he can get a better price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,250,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price.  He should try to negotiate further to see if he can get closer to his desired $1,000,000."

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's offering $1,100,000, which is halfway between his ideal price and Alice's last offer. This shows he's serious about buying but still wants a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $1,150,000 is still within his budget, and it's likely that Alice won't go lower. There's a good chance that further negotiation will only result in more back and forth, potentially wasting time and increasing the risk that Alice will lose patience and refuse to sell.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product."
