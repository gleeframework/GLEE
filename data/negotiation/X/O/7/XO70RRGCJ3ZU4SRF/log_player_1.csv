Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above our minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring we don't miss out on a sale entirely."
