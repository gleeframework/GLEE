"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe a price of $600,000 is more in line with my budget. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually agreeable price.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  I believe this price reflects the value it offers while acknowledging your budget considerations.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate our ongoing discussion and your willingness to find a compromise. While $700,000 is still below my initial assessment, I'm ready to make a significant move to finalize this. I propose a price of $850,000. This represents a considerable reduction on my part and feels like a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, and I think we're very close.  Given your last offer, I'd be willing to close the deal at $800,000. This seems like a fair price that respects the value of the product while working within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,6,
