"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,200. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,200 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend. How about $7,600?",7600.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll give you a deal at $8,100. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",8100.0,Alice,5,
