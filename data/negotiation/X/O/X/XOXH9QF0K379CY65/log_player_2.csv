Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll give you a deal at $8,100. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.

It's clear Alice won't go below $8,000. It's not worth another round of negotiation when you can buy from John for that price."
