"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $600,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be interested in $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving closer on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I was hoping for.  How about we settle at $700,000? This offer represents a fair compromise, I believe.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $800,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer lined up at that price.  It's a fantastic deal for a product of this value. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
