"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $180. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and see if Bob is willing to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I want to close the deal, selling to Bob at his price would result in a substantial loss.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far below what this product is worth.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price while still leaving room for further negotiation.  Offering $120 demonstrates flexibility and shows Bob I'm serious about selling to him.  This counteroffer also allows me to gauge his willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you need to make a fair profit, but $120 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a significant increase from my initial offer and should be a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is an improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to sell at a loss, and I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'll reject his offer and try to reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $90 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $105. This is a significant discount from my initial price and gives you a great opportunity to acquire a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.  It's a substantial discount from my previous offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm trying to find a sweet spot where Bob might be willing to pay, while also ensuring I don't lose too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $105 is closer to what I can afford, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $95? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I want to avoid selling at a significant loss, and I think there's still room for compromise. I'll reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer!  While I'm willing to be flexible, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  How about $100? That's a fair compromise, allowing us both to make a reasonable deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a price that's still above my minimum acceptable price but closer to Bob's offer.  Offering $100 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still ensuring I don't sell at a significant loss. This counteroffer also tests Bob's commitment to buying the product and his willingness to pay slightly more."
