Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Let me know what you think."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far below what this product is worth.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that you need to make a fair profit, but $120 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a significant increase from my initial offer and should be a reasonable compromise."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $90 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $105. This is a significant discount from my initial price and gives you a great opportunity to acquire a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $105 is closer to what I can afford, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $95? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer!  While I'm willing to be flexible, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  How about $100? That's a fair compromise, allowing us both to make a reasonable deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

```

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $100, and you have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $80 from John.  You've negotiated well, but sometimes the best deals are made by walking away."
