{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  By starting high, I allow Bob to counteroffer, which gives me the opportunity to negotiate down to a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Plan B:** I have the option to sell to John at $15,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer than his first offer, $9,000 is still below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Negotiating room:** I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  
* **John's offer provides a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $15,000. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm open to negotiation, $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great price considering the value this product offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer closer to my minimum:**  I'm offering $11,000, which is a significant jump from Bob's offer, but still lower than my desired price.
* **Maintaining flexibility:**  I'm leaving room for further negotiation if Bob still finds the price too high.
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.

By counteroffering at $11,000, I'm trying to find a middle ground and hopefully reach an agreement with Bob while still ensuring I receive a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $10,500 is still below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Room for improvement:** I believe I can still push for a higher price.
* **John's offer is my fallback:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $15,000.

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum, aiming for a final price that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to compromise.  However,  $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closer to my minimum:**  I'm offering $11,500, which is a slight increase from my previous offer but still below my ideal price.
* **Signaling commitment:** I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum.
* **Maintaining negotiation room:**  I'm leaving a small amount of space for Bob to potentially counteroffer, but I'm confident in my position.

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be persuasive enough to convince Bob to accept, but if not, I'm prepared to sell to John for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is well below my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is unlikely to succeed:**  Bob's last offer shows that we are too far apart in price expectations. 
* **John's offer provides a better outcome:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $15,000. 

Given Bob's persistent unwillingness to meet my minimum price, it is more advantageous for me to sell to John, securing a significantly higher price and avoiding further negotiation with Bob."
