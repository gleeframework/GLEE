"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm open to negotiation, $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great price considering the value this product offers. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to compromise.  However,  $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,6,
