"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
