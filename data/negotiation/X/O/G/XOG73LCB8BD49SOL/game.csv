"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $1,350,000 to start the conversation.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,225,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe we can close this transaction.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,180,000?",1180000.0,Alice,5,
