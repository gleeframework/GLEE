"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $1,350,000 to start the conversation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's below your maximum, you can likely negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $1,225,000 is still higher than your target. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,225,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe we can close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,180,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,180,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $1,150,000. Accepting this offer would be a good deal for you as it's still well below your maximum of $1,000,000. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to compromise, and you could end up paying more. Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product at a reasonable price."
