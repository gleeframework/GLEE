"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob! However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $8,500 for the product. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? That would be a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to get closer to my target. I can do $8,600, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",8600.0,Alice,5,
