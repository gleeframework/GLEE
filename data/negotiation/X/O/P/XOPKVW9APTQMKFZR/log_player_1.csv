Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $119 is just below your guaranteed price and leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **""Limited Time"" Tactic:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 

**Important Note:** While this strategy aims to maximize profit, there's a chance Bob might reject the offer. However, you're still guaranteed your minimum price with John."
