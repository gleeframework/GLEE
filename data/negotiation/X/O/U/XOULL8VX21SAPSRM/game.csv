"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $10,500? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,125. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to come to an agreement. What do you say?",10125.0,Alice,5,
