I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I'm hoping to get a good deal and leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still a good price for me, and I'm hoping it will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not a good deal for me, and the negotiation process is getting tedious.  John is a sure thing for $1,200,000, and it's time to cut my losses and move on."
