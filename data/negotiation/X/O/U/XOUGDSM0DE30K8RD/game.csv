"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for your needs, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it.  I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations.  What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it looks great, $22,000 is way beyond my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. This product has a lot of value and I'm confident it can bring you a lot of benefit.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $7,000, but that's my absolute limit. What do you say?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to myself as well.  $7,000 is too low.  Would you be willing to consider $15,000?  That's a significant price drop and reflects my strong desire to find a solution for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  While $15,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $9,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",9000.0,Bob,6,
