"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to $18,000 as possible, as that's the maximum value Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price and  my initial offer. It's too low to accept. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."

I'm counteroffering with $16,000. This is a good compromise, as it's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum price, but I'm showing willingness to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum price, but it's getting closer. However, I'm not ready to accept yet. I'll counteroffer again in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

{""product_price"": 15500}

I'm counteroffering with $15,500. This is a strong price point, considering my minimum price is $15,000. I'm showing that I'm flexible but I'm also not willing to go much lower."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below it. I'm not ready to accept yet and believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and while it's likely he'll continue to increase his offer with each round, I don't want to risk going too low.  I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer and will pay my minimum price.  It's not ideal to not get the highest price, but it's important to know when to walk away.  I'm going to sell to John."
