Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it's still a price that is significantly above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and potentially get a quick deal, but I'm also prepared to go through a few rounds of negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is my absolute minimum, but I'm hoping to get a little more. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter Bob with $13,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum. I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  It's a guaranteed deal and ensures I don't lose out on any profit."
