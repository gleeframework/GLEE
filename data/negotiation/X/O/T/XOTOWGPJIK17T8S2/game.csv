"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500?  That way, we both get a fair price.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too far apart from $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",8250.0,Bob,4,
