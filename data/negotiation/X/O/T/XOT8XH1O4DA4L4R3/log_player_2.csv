"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're the only ones with access to it, I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $800,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's a good price, there's still room for negotiation to save even more."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's counteroffer of $725,000 is a good deal.  You're still getting the product for less than what it's worth to you ($800,000), and you've already saved a significant amount.  It's likely that further negotiation will only result in small savings, and you could risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option at this point."
