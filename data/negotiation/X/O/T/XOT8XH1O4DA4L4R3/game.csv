"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
