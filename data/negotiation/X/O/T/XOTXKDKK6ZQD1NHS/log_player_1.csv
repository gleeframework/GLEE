Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a compromise between my minimum value ($15,000) and Bob's maximum value ($8,000). It's likely to be appealing to Bob while still earning me a significant profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value proposition for Bob, highlighting the potential benefits of owning the product. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes that:

* You have no information about Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* You are confident that John will buy the product for $15,000 if Bob rejects your offer. 

In a real-world scenario, you might need to adjust your offer based on your understanding of Bob's negotiation style and your risk tolerance."
