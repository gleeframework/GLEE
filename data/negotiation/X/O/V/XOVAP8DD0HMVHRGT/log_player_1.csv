"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher final price.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This offer will help determine how eager Bob is to purchase the product. His response will indicate his willingness to negotiate within this range or if a different approach is needed. 
* **Alternative Option:**  The safety net of John's offer allows for a bolder opening strategy. If Bob outright rejects this initial high price, it might be more beneficial to move on to John instead of engaging in protracted negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his stated value. While his counter-offer was expected, accepting a price this low would leave significant money on the table. It's worth negotiating further to find a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counter-offer positions the price closer to the midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's counter-offer but leans slightly more in your favor. This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a strong profit. 
* **Maintaining Firmness:**  While willing to negotiate, this counter-offer emphasizes that you won't settle for a price drastically below your minimum.
* **Time Consideration:**  There are still several rounds left, allowing room for further negotiation.  If Bob remains unreasonable, the option to accept John's offer is always available."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer, but $1,150,000 is still under our safety net of John's offer.  Bob has shown a willingness to move upwards in price, so there's room for further negotiation to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's aim for a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we settle at $1,275,000? This ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're moving closer to John's offer but still holding a strong position. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while reinforcing the product's value. 
* **Time Factor:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds.  This offer encourages Bob to take a more serious stance and recognize we have other options.
* **Anchoring:** By consistently staying above $1,250,000, we are anchoring the negotiation above the guaranteed offer from John, aiming for the best possible outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to do $1,200,000.  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met our absolute minimum price, which also happens to be equal to John's offer. While we could try to push for more, Bob has stated this is his final offer.  Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing both offers by pushing too hard."
