"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $135? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $120 was a bit low, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $135. How about $127.50? Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",127.5,Bob,4,
