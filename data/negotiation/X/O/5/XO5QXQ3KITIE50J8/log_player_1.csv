Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's high demand and your other options, justifying the high price without revealing your absolute bottom line.
* **Urgency and scarcity:**  The ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**This strategy aims to:**

1. **Maximize profit:** If Bob accepts, you earn a significant amount above his perceived value.
2. **Maintain the fallback option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell to John at your desired price."
