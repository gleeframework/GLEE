"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1400000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a decent starting point, it's still above Bob's desired price of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1350000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to give up on the value of the product just yet. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $1320000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is still above Bob's desired price of $1,200,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that Alice is not willing to go much lower.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for his target price. This ensures he gets the product while staying within his budget."
