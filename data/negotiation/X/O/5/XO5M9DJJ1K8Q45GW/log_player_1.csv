Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
