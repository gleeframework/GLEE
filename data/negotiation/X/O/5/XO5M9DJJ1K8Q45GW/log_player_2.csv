"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, it's still higher than Alice's value of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to your business. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's value:** $1,075,000 is only $25,000 more than Bob's maximum budget.  
* **Further negotiation may not be worth it:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk Alice will reject and the deal could fall apart.  
* **Time is a factor:** With only 10 rounds, it's important to consider the opportunity cost of continued negotiation.  

Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price that's within Bob's budget and minimizes the risk of losing the deal."
