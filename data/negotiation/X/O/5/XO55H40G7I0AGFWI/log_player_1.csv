Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm willing to compromise. I can then adjust my price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $65 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
