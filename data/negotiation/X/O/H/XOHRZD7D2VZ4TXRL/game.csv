"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
