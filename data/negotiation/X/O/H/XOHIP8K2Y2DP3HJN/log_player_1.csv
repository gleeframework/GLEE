{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best price I can offer at the moment."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering $115, which is a bit more than Bob's value of $100, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Goal:**  I want to maximize my profit, so I'm starting high, but not so high that Bob will immediately reject the offer. 
* **Flexibility:**  By leaving some room for negotiation, I can potentially get closer to my minimum value of $120, or at least secure a good deal with Bob. 
* **John as a Backup:**  The knowledge that I can sell to John for $120 gives me confidence to push for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is offering $105, which is closer to his value but still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to explore a counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** While I'm open to negotiating further, I know I can always sell to John for $120 if this negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about $110?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $110, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm reminding Bob that $110 is still a good deal for him, as it's below his estimated value of $100.
* **Move Towards Agreement:**  By narrowing the gap, I'm increasing the chances of reaching an agreement with Bob without having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we meet at $108? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  While his offer is getting closer, there's still room for me to push for a higher price. I believe I can potentially get him up to $110, which would be a more acceptable outcome.
* **John's Safety Net:** As always, knowing that I can sell to John for $120 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $108 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 109}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that $109 is my final offer. This adds pressure to Bob to accept or walk away.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between our previous offers, which demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Minimizing Loss:** $109 is still closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120 than Bob's last offer.  I'm willing to take a small loss to close the deal rather than risking getting nothing from Bob.
* **John's Backup:** I still have the option to sell to John for $120 if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable going up to $109. I'm willing to go up to $107, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if you're willing to meet me at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $107 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  The negotiation has gone back and forth, and there's limited room for further negotiation. I've already made significant concessions.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, where Bob and I reach an impasse, and I end up losing time and potentially the sale to John.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $120 ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids any further risk."
