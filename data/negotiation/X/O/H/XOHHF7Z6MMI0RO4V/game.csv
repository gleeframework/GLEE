"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $9000. My minimum price is $11000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
