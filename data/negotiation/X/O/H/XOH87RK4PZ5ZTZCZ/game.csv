"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but  $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,325,000?  Let's make this happen.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down from $1,400,000 to $1,325,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to $1,300,000. How about we try $1,315,000?",1315000.0,Bob,4,
