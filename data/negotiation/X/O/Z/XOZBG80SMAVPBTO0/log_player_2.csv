"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $120.
* Alice is offering it for $100.
* You can potentially get it for less.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise.
* It's important to show Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but also that you're not going to accept her initial price without negotiation. 
*  This price is still higher than Alice's minimum, so there's a chance she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You still have the potential to get the product for a lower price than $95, as Alice is willing to negotiate.
* You are only willing to pay up to $120, and Alice has already come down to $95. There is room for further negotiation.
* While buying from John for $120 is an option, it's still more expensive than Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy the product today. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer and Alice's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* It's still a decent saving for you compared to buying from John.
* The message emphasizes a sense of urgency and readiness to close the deal.
* This leaves some room for Alice to potentially counter with a slightly higher price, but still keeps you in a good bargaining position."
