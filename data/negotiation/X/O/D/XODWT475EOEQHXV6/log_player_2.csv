"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm asking for $11,500 for, which is a fair price considering its worth to me and the potential benefits it could bring you.  Let me know your thoughts!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is slightly above Alice's perceived value, it's still less than your maximum budget of $12,000 and the price offered by John. Accepting this offer saves you $500 compared to buying from John."
