""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, we want to get as close to that as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping us well above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident Presentation:** The language used is positive and emphasizes the product's value, aiming to influence Bob's perception.

By aiming high but not unreasonably so, we increase our chances of securing a deal close to Bob's maximum valuation, while still having the safety net of John's offer."
