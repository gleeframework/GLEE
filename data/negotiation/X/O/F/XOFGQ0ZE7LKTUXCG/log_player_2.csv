"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is better than $12,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his maximum budget as possible. Offering $8,500 is a significant drop from Alice's $10,000 offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. This price is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $12,000, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now closer to Bob's budget:**  $9,500 is only $1,500 over Bob's maximum of $8,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer could lead to a stalemate, forcing Bob to buy from John at $8,000. 
* **Potential for a deal:**  There's a chance that Alice might be willing to negotiate further if Bob rejects the offer, but the risk of getting stuck at $8,000 outweighs the potential savings. 

By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product at a reasonable price, even if it's not the absolute lowest possible."
