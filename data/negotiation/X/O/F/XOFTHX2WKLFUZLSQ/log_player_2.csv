"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to Bob.  Alice's offer is significantly higher, so it makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant move. It's unlikely Alice will accept this offer, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation and shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still higher than his ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting allows Bob to continue exploring a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer continues to move towards Bob's ideal price while remaining realistic. It's a compromise that shows Bob is willing to pay more than his initial offer but still expects a substantial discount from Alice's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's limit, it's still above his ideal price. There's still a small gap to close, and rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's last offer and Bob's ideal price, showing a willingness to meet halfway.  It's a significant step closer to a deal while still leaving room for negotiation."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Alice's offer is very close to Bob's limit, he's still determined to save as much as possible.  There's still a small amount of potential savings, and rejecting allows for one last attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This final counteroffer aims to close the deal by offering Bob's maximum price.  It's a bold move, but it's a calculated risk given the limited rounds remaining.  If Alice rejects, Bob can always buy from John, guaranteeing he gets the product at his limit."
