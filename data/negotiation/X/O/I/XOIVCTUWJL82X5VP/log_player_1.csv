"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation but also reflects the minimum value I place on the product.  I want to see if Bob is interested in paying a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a little more. I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a deal in the next round.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100 if I don't get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to stick with my strategy of making small compromises to encourage Bob to meet me halfway. $120 is a bit closer to Bob's last offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if I can close the deal in this round."
