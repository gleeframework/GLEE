Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer aims for a good starting point. It's a bit higher than the product's value to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to make him more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe I can't exceed $12,000 for this purchase. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

Bob is offering the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price. It's also faster to close the deal now, avoiding potential further negotiations."
