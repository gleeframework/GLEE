"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still leaves you a healthy profit margin. What do you say?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is simply not enough for me. This product is worth more, and I'm confident I can find a buyer who values it accordingly.  I'm willing to make one final concession,  $1,125,000. This is my absolute bottom line. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move on to other opportunities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,125,000.  While getting the product for a bit less than $1,125,000 would be ideal, it's risky to continue negotiating. We know we have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000, which saves us a significant amount. It's time to cut our losses and secure the better deal with John."
