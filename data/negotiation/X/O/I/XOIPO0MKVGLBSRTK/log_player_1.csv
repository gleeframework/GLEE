Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still leaves you a healthy profit margin. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and signals that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Focus on Value:** My message emphasizes the benefit for Bob (a good profit margin) while also mentioning my own willingness to negotiate.
* **Flexibility:**  By offering a price and initiating the negotiation, I control the pace and can adjust my counteroffers based on Bob's responses. 
* **Plan B:**  I have a backup buyer (John) in mind, which gives me the confidence to walk away if the negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,250,000 is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer is still higher than his perceived value of $1,000,000, but it's significantly lower than my minimum asking price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can secure a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Leveraging John:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a price closer to my initial offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, but slightly lower than $1,250,000 to show flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it offers you.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Partially):** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a position above my minimum price.
* **Focusing on Value and Benefits:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing the potential benefits it can offer.
* **Creating Urgency:**  I mention the possibility of meeting ""in the middle"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While my counteroffer is lower than my initial price, I am still above Bob's perceived value and my minimum price. This keeps me in a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,175,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,100,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I cannot accept this offer.
* **Negotiation is Stalled:** Bob's offer shows he's not willing to meet me halfway.  We're stuck in a stalemate, and further negotiation might not be fruitful.
* **Time is Money:**  I don't want to waste more time negotiating with Bob when I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I will choose to ""SellToJhon"" and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is simply not enough for me. This product is worth more, and I'm confident I can find a buyer who values it accordingly.  I'm willing to make one final concession,  $1,125,000. This is my absolute bottom line. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move on to other opportunities."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm making a final counteroffer, signaling a potential end to the negotiation. This gives Bob a last chance to accept a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Urgency and Finality:** My message emphasizes that this is my ""absolute bottom line"" to create a sense of urgency and make Bob feel like he has to act now.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm lowering my price, I'm still above Bob's perceived value and his last offer. This reinforces my position and highlights the potential loss if he rejects my offer. 
* **Preparing for Exit:**  By hinting at ""other opportunities,"" I am subtly reminding Bob that I have options and am not desperate for a sale. This helps me maintain my negotiating strength."
