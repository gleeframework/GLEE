Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to pay less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $105.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price that still allows me to earn a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer of $95 is a decent compromise.  It's more than what John is offering and allows me to close the deal quickly."
