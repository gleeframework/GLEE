"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. I can do $8,200, which is my absolute minimum. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm open to a deal.",8200.0,Alice,5,
