"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is better than Alice's asking price, it's still above your maximum budget. You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above your maximum budget. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while setting a clear limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1250000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial partnership. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $1,350,000 is still above your maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to both get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're increasing our offer to show willingness to meet halfway, but still staying within our maximum budget.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** Highlighting the ""significant jump"" from the previous offer reinforces that we're making a genuine effort.
* **Open-ended question:** This invites Alice to consider the offer and potentially counter with a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $1300000 is still a bit short of what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000, which is a good compromise for both of us. This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it will be mutually beneficial for our long-term partnership. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's clear that Alice is not willing to go lower, and further negotiation might lead to a deadlock.  Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative in John, it's the most prudent decision to purchase the product from John for $1,200,000 to secure the product within his budget."
