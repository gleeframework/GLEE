"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening Offer:** I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a decent starting point, as it's a bit lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and professional, emphasizing fairness and inviting Bob to discuss the offer.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** My goal is to get as close to my minimum of $1,500,000 as possible, but I'm willing to concede a bit to close the deal. I'll assess Bob's responses and adjust my counteroffers accordingly. 
* **Backup Option:** It's important to remember that John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not under immense pressure to close with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1400000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I want to close the deal, accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. 

I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price point.  The option of selling to John for $1,500,000 remains a valuable backup if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial partnership. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is still above Bob's initial offer but significantly lower than my opening price. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints but emphasize the value of the product and the potential for a long-term relationship. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** My goal is to continue inching towards my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm still aware that selling to John is always an option, giving me leverage in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to both get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not desperate for a sale, and I'm confident I can get a better price. 

I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  I'll continue to use the option of selling to John as leverage to push for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit short of what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it will be mutually beneficial for our long-term partnership. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's last offer, showing my commitment to getting closer to my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm positive but firm, reiterating the value of the product and emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial partnership.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm trying to push Bob towards my minimum acceptable price. This offer might be close enough to trigger a deal or lead to further compromise from Bob.
* **Backup Plan:** The option to sell to John is still on the table, which gives me confidence to negotiate further."
