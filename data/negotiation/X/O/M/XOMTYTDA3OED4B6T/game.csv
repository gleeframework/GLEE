"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1400000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1250000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial partnership. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to both get a good deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $1300000 is still a bit short of what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000, which is a good compromise for both of us. This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it will be mutually beneficial for our long-term partnership. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
