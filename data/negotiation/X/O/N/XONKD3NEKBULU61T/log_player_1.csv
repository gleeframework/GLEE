Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given its value to you, I believe a price of $1,300,000 would be a fair starting point for negotiation.  What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
