"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given its value to you, I believe a price of $1,300,000 would be a fair starting point for negotiation.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, I'm also confident in the product's value exceeding $1,300,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. Let's try $1,325,000. It's a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. What do you think?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your persistence. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,337,500? It's a strong offer that reflects the product's true worth.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
