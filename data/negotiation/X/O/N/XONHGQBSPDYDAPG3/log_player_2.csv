Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  I believe this is still a fair price that allows us both to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this deal work.  Let's find some common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, which is a good sign, but it's still above my desired price point. I have more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can get closer to my target of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work, but I can't go any higher. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 still isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be at least $1,350,000 for this to work. Let's get closer to finding a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but it's still not within my acceptable range.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I don't want to jump to $1,350,000 just yet.  I'll counter with a price closer to my target, hoping to find a compromise in the remaining rounds."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  However, I'm willing to bridge the gap and offer $1,300,000. This reflects a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that will allow us to both walk away satisfied. Let's reach a deal in these final rounds."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
