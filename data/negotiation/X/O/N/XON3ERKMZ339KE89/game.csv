"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm more comfortable in the range of  $700,000.  Would you be willing to consider something closer to that?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I could consider $875,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its value.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I agree the product is valuable, $875,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $785,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",785000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I've done some calculations on my end, and the absolute lowest I can go is $825,000. This is a firm offer, as it barely covers the value this product represents.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price.  If you're willing to consider $800,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
