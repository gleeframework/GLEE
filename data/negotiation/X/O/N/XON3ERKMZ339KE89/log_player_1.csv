Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm more comfortable in the range of  $700,000.  Would you be willing to consider something closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I could consider $875,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I agree the product is valuable, $875,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $785,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but $785,000 is still below John's offer. It's worth risking another round to try and get Bob closer to $800,000 or higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I've done some calculations on my end, and the absolute lowest I can go is $825,000. This is a firm offer, as it barely covers the value this product represents."",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price.  If you're willing to consider $800,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has met our minimum acceptable price, which is equal to John's offer.  There's no benefit to further negotiation or risking losing the sale."
