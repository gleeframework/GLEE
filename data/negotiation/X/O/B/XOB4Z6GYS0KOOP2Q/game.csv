"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase the product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think, Bob?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, $13500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $17000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the new offer, Alice. I understand that you need to get closer to your minimum price. However, $17000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you halfway between our last offers. I'll offer $14500. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to accept it, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000.",14500.0,Bob,6,
