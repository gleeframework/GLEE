# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $950,000 is a step closer, it's still below what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the significant value you'll gain and provides a good starting point for our discussion.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
