"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This reflects the potential benefits, but also acknowledges the need for a mutually agreeable price. Let's see if we can work something out.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $950,000 is a step closer, it's still below what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the significant value you'll gain and provides a good starting point for our discussion.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while also allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
