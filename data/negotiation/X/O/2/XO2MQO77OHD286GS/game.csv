"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but I think $900,000 is a bit high. How about we bring it down to $700,000? I think that's a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",800000.0,Alice,5,
