"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, given its value to me. Let's work together to find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which is a significant step closer to my budget. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering our previous negotiations. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
