"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has tremendous potential and I'm confident you'll love it. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to start with an offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your optimism about the product's potential.  However, $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer you $1,200,000, which is still significantly less than the product's worth to me. I believe this is a fair price, considering your asking price and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $1,200,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on the product and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at this time.  To make a deal, I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering we're both willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you. However, I'm not ready to accept $1,250,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on the product and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
