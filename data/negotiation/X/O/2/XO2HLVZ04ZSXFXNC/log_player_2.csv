"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has tremendous potential and I'm confident you'll love it. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to start with an offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me ($1,500,000). I'm going to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your optimism about the product's potential.  However, $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer you $1,200,000, which is still significantly less than the product's worth to me. I believe this is a fair price, considering your asking price and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $1,200,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on the product and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to try to push for a lower price before considering buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at this time.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you. However, I'm not ready to accept $1,250,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on the product and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm running out of time.  $1,300,000 is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to me and the fact that John is asking for $1,500,000.  I'm going to accept Alice's offer to avoid risking losing the product to John."
