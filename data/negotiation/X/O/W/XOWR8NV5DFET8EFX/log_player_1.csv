"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that I have a fallback option with John for $12,000. This will give me room to negotiate and see if Bob is genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe it has great potential value. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose an offer of $15000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my starting price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This reflects the value I place on the product, and it's a fair price considering its potential. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding out for a significant profit.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to try and convince Bob that the price is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my considerations, I would like to propose an offer of $15500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit and I'm worried about running out of rounds.  I'm also starting to think that Bob may not be willing to go much higher."
