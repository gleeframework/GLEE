"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9250?  This price reflects the value I know you'll get out of it, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's try $9000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
