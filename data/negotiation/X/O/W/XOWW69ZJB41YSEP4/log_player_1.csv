``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially lead to a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my goal."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8800? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get out of the product.

You have three options:

While $8,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's try $9,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $9000. How about we try $8500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob seems unwilling to budge on his price.  While I'd prefer to sell it to Bob, I don't want to keep negotiating and risk losing out on a guaranteed $10,000 from John.  I'm going to sell to John."
