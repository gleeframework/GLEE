Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's my offer to Bob:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you something incredibly valuable to both of us. I know you'll benefit greatly from this, even more than my minimum price represents. How about we make this a win-win and settle on a price of $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, it's worth trying to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $900,000 creates a significant profit margin for me while still leaving Bob with a potential $100,000 of perceived value (his $800,000 valuation minus the $900,000 price).
* **Win-Win Framing:** The message emphasizes mutual benefit, suggesting that the deal is good for both parties. 
 
This approach balances securing a sale with maximizing my potential profit."
