"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $110 is really pushing my bottom line. How about we split the difference and call it $115? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $115 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $110, that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge past $110.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a strong chance he's firm on this price. Selling to John for $120 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of a lower offer from Bob in later rounds."
