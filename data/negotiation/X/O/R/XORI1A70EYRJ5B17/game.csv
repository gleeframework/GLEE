"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $130. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $165.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $165 is still a little too high for me.  How about we settle on $145? I'm pretty sure that's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $155. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",155.0,Alice,5,
