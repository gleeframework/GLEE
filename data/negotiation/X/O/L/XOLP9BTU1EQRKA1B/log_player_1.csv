"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This gives me some room to move down if needed. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and using positive language to make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** By starting with a higher price, I create an opportunity for Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Leaving room for Plan B:** I'm aware of the alternative buyer (John) and am not afraid to walk away from the negotiation if it doesn't benefit me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** I need to make at least $15,000 to consider this worthwhile. While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm not desperate. I can continue the negotiation, knowing I have a backup buyer in John. This gives me leverage to potentially get a better price from Bob.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if I can reach a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective.  $9,500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. "", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. This shows I'm open to a deal but still maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll gain from owning it.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm lowering my price, I'm still above Bob's initial counteroffer, giving me leverage in case he needs to counter again. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below the minimum I need to make this worth my while.  I need to make at least $15,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's still room for negotiation. I can offer a counteroffer and see if we can come to an agreement before I have to resort to selling to John. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get a better price closer to my desired outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This is my final offer. If you're serious about getting this product, I encourage you to accept. Otherwise, I'll have to move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm making a small concession by lowering my price from the previous round, showing I'm willing to meet halfway, but still maintaining a profit above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Alternative:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the possibility of selling to John, creating urgency.
* **No Room for Further Negotiation:** By making this my final offer, I remove any room for further negotiation, forcing Bob to either accept or move on. 

This counteroffer is a calculated risk. It's my last attempt to secure a deal with Bob while still ensuring I meet my minimum profit target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Edge:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We're in round 6, and I'm running out of time to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Guarantee Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit of $15,000. 

While I'd like to get a better price, it's not worth risking further negotiation when I have a guaranteed deal with John. I'm choosing to sell the product to John to ensure my desired profit."
