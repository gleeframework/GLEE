Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, but we also want to make sure Bob is likely to buy.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100. Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price with John creates a strong incentive for Bob to buy. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is already attractive, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly eager.  

This strategy aims to secure a sale at a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value while still remaining attractive enough to avoid going to the backup buyer."
