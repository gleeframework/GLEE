Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer you, as Alice, can send to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Strong but Not Greedy:**  $1,150,000 gives you a significant profit ($150,000) while still offering Bob a good deal compared to his valuation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher. If he's more easygoing, this offer might be spot on.
* **Urgency:** If you're not in a rush, you can afford to hold out for a higher price. If you need to sell quickly, you might adjust downwards."
