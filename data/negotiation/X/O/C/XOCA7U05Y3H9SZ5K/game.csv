"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exceptional opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $9000. I'm willing to consider $12000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I can see that you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, which is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $11000, so I'll offer $10500. Can you consider this price?",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the terms of the sale. I'll sell the product to you for $10500, but I'd like to throw in some additional support and maintenance services, which I value at $500. This way, you'll get the product and some extra benefits. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extra services, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I'd like to discuss the terms without the additional services. Can you consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,8,
