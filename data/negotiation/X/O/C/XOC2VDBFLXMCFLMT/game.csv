"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $8,800 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,150?  That way, we both get a fair price. What do you say?",9150.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,600 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it's the best I can do.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
