"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. It's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but I want to see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to lower the price slightly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $7,500 is too low for me, and I think I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's a step in the right direction and closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, $7,000 is still too low for me. I'll counteroffer in the next round, but I'm also going to start considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8250}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $8,250. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and a good middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping he will accept this time. If not, I might seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, he might walk away entirely.  I've reached a point where it's better to secure the guaranteed $8,000 from John than to risk losing out altogether."
