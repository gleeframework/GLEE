{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum of $100 but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value and accept, but if not, I'm prepared to counter his offer or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I'd like to get.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $110? I think that's a more reasonable price for the product.

While $110 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $110 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

I'm going to sell to John. Bob has made it clear he's not willing to go higher than $110, and while that's better than nothing, it's not worth risking more negotiation rounds. I'd rather secure the sale to John for $100 and move on."
