"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm starting the price at $130, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is within your budget, it's still too high. You want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's still within my budget but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to overpay. It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That would still leave you with a good deal, and I wouldn't have to lower my price too much. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $120 is a good compromise. It's still within my budget and allows me to save $10 compared to buying from John.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product while saving money."
