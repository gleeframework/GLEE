Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little too high for me.  How about we bring it down to $700,000?

We're still below John's offer, and Bob has shown a willingness to move. Let's see if we can negotiate him a bit higher."

Bob has met our minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee we can get more out of him, and waiting carries the risk of him lowering his offer.  We should accept."
