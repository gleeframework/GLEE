{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $130."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my $150 value as possible, but I'm willing to compromise to make the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $85 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $100? That would be a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $90?  That's the absolute most I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before deciding to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is still a bit too low.  How about $95? I think that's a fair compromise that we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  How about $92? That's the very last offer I can make. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd love to sell the product to Bob, his final offer of $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price of $150, I'll go ahead and sell to him."
