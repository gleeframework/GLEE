,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $85 right now.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $100? That would be a fair price for both of us. ",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $90?  That's the absolute most I can do.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is still a bit too low.  How about $95? I think that's a fair compromise that we can both agree on.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  How about $92? That's the very last offer I can make.",92.0,Bob,6,
