"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its true worth.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth to me. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,150,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my initial asking price.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
