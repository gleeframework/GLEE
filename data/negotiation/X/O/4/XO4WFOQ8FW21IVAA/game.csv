"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. Let's make this happen!",140.0,Alice,3,
