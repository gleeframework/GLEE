"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. I'm hoping Bob sees the value of the product and is willing to pay a premium. However, if he rejects this offer, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$700,000 is far too low. While I want to close the deal, I'm not desperate. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000.  This is still a significant profit for me and I hope Bob sees the value in closing the deal.  If he rejects this offer, I'll be forced to seriously consider selling to John at $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$900,000 is still too low, even though it's getting closer. I'm going to counter again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'm not sure how much lower I can go without seriously considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, as it's the same price I can get from John. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John.  I'm hoping he realizes this is a fair price and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit. Bob's offer of $850,000 is simply not enough, even though it's the highest he's offered.  I've already made it clear that $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum, and he's not willing to meet that.  I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John."
