"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm starting the bidding at $2,000,000.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Open to Agreement:**  The message emphasizes finding a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" indicating a willingness to negotiate.

By starting high, Alice anchors the negotiation in her favor.  While Bob is unlikely to accept this initial offer, it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. This product holds value for me, but closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below Alice's minimum acceptable price. While selling to John is always an option, Alice still has plenty of room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,800,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's potential."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:**  Alice starts by acknowledging Bob's offer, showing she's engaged in the negotiation.
* **Firm but Fair:**  She reiterates that his offer is too low but makes a significant counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Justification:** Alice subtly reminds Bob of the product's value to justify the high price.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price closer to Alice's target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate you coming down, $1,800,000 is still out of my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to be realistic about the price. How about $1,250,000? I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still significantly less than John's offer and a considerable amount less than Alice's ideal price.  Alice has leverage as she knows she has a guaranteed buyer. It's worth countering again to test Bob's willingness to move closer to her desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground. If you're willing to meet me at $1,600,000, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Goal-Oriented:** Alice cuts to the chase, proposing a specific price and making it clear this is her target for agreement.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By phrasing it as ""we have a deal,"" Alice implies this is her final offer, encouraging Bob to act.
* **Strategic Concession:**  The offer is a significant drop from $1,800,000, suggesting a willingness to compromise but still well above both Bob's offer and John's offer. 

This strategy aims to pressure Bob to make a decision while keeping the potential profit margin substantial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work. I'm hopeful we can find an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing more willingness to negotiate, his offer increases are incremental. At $1,350,000, he's still significantly below John's standing offer of $1,500,000.  

* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a cost. Each round increases the risk that he walks away or that they don't reach a mutually agreeable price within the 10-round limit.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John represents a guaranteed sale at Alice's desired minimum price.

Alice is better off taking the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than risking a lower final price or a stalemate with Bob."
