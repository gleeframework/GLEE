Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but there's a good chance he'll accept to avoid missing out on a product he values highly. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $9,500 is a considerable profit compared to the $8,000 backup offer from John."
