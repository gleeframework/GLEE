Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is above the product's worth to Bob, but still gives room for negotiation. This approach aims to:

* **Start strong:** Shows confidence in the product's value and sets a high starting point.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Allows for Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain leverage:** If Bob rejects, you can always move on to John, ensuring you don't lose out on a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is below our ideal price, it's still within a reasonable range considering his stated willingness to pay. Rejecting his offer allows us to:

* **Maintain leverage:** We demonstrate we are not desperate for a sale and are willing to stand our ground.
* **Potentially achieve a better price:** By making a counteroffer, we might be able to close the gap and secure a higher price than Bob's initial proposal. 
* **Explore all options:** Selling to John is always a safe fallback, but we haven't exhausted all negotiation options with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to my initial proposal. Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000? This would allow us both to achieve a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Compromise:** We've lowered our initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a higher value:** We're still offering a price higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, pushing for a more favorable outcome.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects, we can still lower our price slightly in future rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I respect your position, I would like to suggest a price closer to my budget. Could we agree on $1,050,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to our guaranteed value from John, and it's reasonable considering the negotiation progress. Accepting his offer secures a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which could lead to a lower price or a prolonged process."
