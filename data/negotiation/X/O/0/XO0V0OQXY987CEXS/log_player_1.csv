Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** My message emphasizes the value to Bob, creating an incentive for him to consider the offer.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm aware of John's offer, which gives me a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. 
* **Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer that's more in line with my desired price point.
* **John's Offer:** Although John's offer is significantly higher, I want to see if I can secure a better price with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, I can potentially reach a more favorable outcome without completely abandoning the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:**  My counteroffer of $1,250,000 represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  The message frames this price as a ""middle ground"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to consider my proposal.

This counteroffer aims to:

*  Maintain leverage: It's still higher than Bob's offer, suggesting I'm not desperate.
*  Move closer to a deal: The lower price may encourage Bob to accept or counteroffer with a more reasonable amount.
*  Avoid John's offer:  I'm seeking a better price than John's, but I'm prepared to sell if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is only $25,000 away from my previous counteroffer of $1,250,000. 
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** While I could counteroffer again, there's a chance Bob might not budge further.
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing the negotiation risks losing valuable time and potentially losing John as a buyer.
* **John's Offer:**  While John offers a higher price, accepting Bob's offer still brings in a significant amount of money.

Considering all factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical and beneficial decision. It secures a high price without risking a lengthy negotiation that could lead to a less favorable outcome."
