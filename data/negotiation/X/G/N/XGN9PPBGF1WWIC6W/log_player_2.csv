"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $110, which is above Bob's maximum price of $120. 
* **John's Offer:**  $120, which is Bob's maximum price.

Since Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum, it's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  While John's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Bob's desired price. Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Starting Point:** Bob's counteroffer starts at $95, which is still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Bob is aiming to establish a starting point that is closer to his desired price range. 

By offering $95, Bob shows that he's serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a better deal. This counteroffer provides a starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $102?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $102, which is still higher than Bob's desired price, but closer to his maximum.
* **John's Offer:** $120, which is Bob's maximum price.

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $102 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $98.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 98.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible, but also be reasonable to close the deal.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Bob is offering a price that is halfway between his previous offer ($95) and Alice's latest offer ($102). This shows a willingness to compromise and meet in the middle. 
* **Fairness Appeal:** Bob emphasizes the fairness of his offer, suggesting it's a good deal for both parties.

By offering $98.50, Bob maintains a strong negotiating position while also demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement."
