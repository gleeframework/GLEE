"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $10,000 is considerably below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
