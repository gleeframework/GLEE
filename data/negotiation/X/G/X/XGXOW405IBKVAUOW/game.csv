"I understand your hard limit, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to compromise further. I'll meet you at $875,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to consider. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're willing to budge, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $875,000.
