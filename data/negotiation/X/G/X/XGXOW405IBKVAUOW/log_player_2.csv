Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're willing to budge, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers, which would be $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We're getting close to our limit:** Alice is now at $850,000, which is a reasonable compromise.  Going much lower could risk alienating her.
* **Limited rounds:** We only have a few rounds left. While we could push a little harder, there's a chance we won't reach a significantly better price.
* **Saving money:**  Even at $850,000, we are still saving a substantial amount compared to John's offer of $1,200,000.

This deal makes sense and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity with Alice."
