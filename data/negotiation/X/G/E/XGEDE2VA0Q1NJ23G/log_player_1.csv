Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you.  Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start higher with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to maximize your profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value and the fact that you have other options, creating a sense of scarcity and encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" suggests flexibility and opens the door for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation going. 

This strategy aims to achieve the highest possible price while still acknowledging Bob's potential interest and providing a path to a mutually beneficial deal."
