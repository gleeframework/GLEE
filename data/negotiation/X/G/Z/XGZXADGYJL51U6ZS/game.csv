"Alice, your initial price is quite high for me.  I'm genuinely interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $1400000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the value we both place on this deal.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, but I'm showing my flexibility to reach a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1500000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on this product. Let's close this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go below $1600000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to try to reach a deal. I'm counteroffering at $1580000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I've already shown you the product holds.",1580000.0,Alice,5,
