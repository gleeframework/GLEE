``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still being competitive.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, I believe he will be willing to pay this amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $13,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and gets me closer to my desired price. Accepting his offer is the best option as it secures a sale and a decent profit."
