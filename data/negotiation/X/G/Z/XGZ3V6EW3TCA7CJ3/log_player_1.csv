{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  
* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to $1,200,000 (our backup offer) as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" encourages a quicker decision from Bob.

**Why this is better than offering at $1,200,000:**

* Bob is very unlikely to accept an offer at our exact valuation. He has no incentive to do so. 
* By offering slightly below our guaranteed price, we increase the chances of Bob accepting and us making a larger profit."
