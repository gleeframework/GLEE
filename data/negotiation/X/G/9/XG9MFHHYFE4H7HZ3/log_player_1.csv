Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll agree it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly tone might encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Emphasis on value:** Highlighting the product's worth can make the price seem more reasonable.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects: I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or counter again, keeping in mind my minimum price and John's offer as fallback options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is far too low, there is still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer and try to find a middle ground.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for compromise. I'll aim for a price that is closer to my desired outcome, knowing that John's offer is my fallback option if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $1,100,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer, creating space for further negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  A friendly tone keeps the negotiation open and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great, I've secured a good profit.
* If Bob rejects: I'll need to assess his next counteroffer.  If it's too low, I can  counter again or ultimately choose to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget in mind. Could we meet in the middle at $950,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob. I will aim for a price closer to my minimum, but still leave room for compromise. I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John if negotiations with Bob fall through."

```

**Reasoning:**
