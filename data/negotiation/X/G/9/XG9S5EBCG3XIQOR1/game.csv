"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, so let's meet halfway. How about $1,200,000? This price reflects both the product's worth and my willingness to negotiate a fair deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet at $900,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still below my bottom line. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000?  This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your perspective on the price, and I want to find a solution that works for us both.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,050,000. I believe this is my final offer, and it represents a substantial compromise while still reflecting the significant value this product brings.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
