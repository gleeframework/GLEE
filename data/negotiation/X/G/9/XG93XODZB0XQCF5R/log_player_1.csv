Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum but also significantly above my fallback option. I should counter to see if there's room for negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said,  $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $1,075,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and is moving closer to my price. Accepting now is a sure gain of $275,000 over my fallback.
