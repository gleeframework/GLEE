Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

My reasoning:

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($100) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The $95 offer gives me room to negotiate down if Bob pushes back, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price ($80). 
* **Confident Tone:** The message implies the product's value and encourages Bob to accept the offer.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $88 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, but Room for More:** Bob's offer of $88 is above my minimum ($80), but I believe I can still negotiate a better price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this offer, I'm gauging how much further Bob is willing to go.  It's possible he values the product even more than he's letting on.
* **John as Backup:** I'm keeping the option to sell to John ($80) open, but I see potential for a higher profit with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm looking for something closer to $92.  This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."",
""product_price"": 92
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** I lowered my price by $3, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but not drastically. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the higher price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer keeps me above Bob's initial counteroffer while staying within a reasonable range of his perceived value.  I'm aiming for a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see your point, Alice. I value your product highly, but I'm sticking to my budget. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $90 is a great price, exceeding my minimum by $10.  
* **Bob's Limit?:**  Bob increasing his offer twice suggests he's nearing his maximum price. Holding out further risks losing the sale.
* **Time Value:**  Every round of negotiation takes time. Accepting now secures the profit and allows me to move on to other deals."
