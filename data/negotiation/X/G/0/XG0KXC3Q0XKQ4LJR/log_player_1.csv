"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message helps establish rapport and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning the product's value to Bob strengthens the offer's appeal.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to close the deal quickly with a reasonable price. However, if Bob rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds. If the negotiations stall or I feel like I'm not getting close to my desired price, I'll switch to selling to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my desired $10,000, but still taking into account Bob's budget concerns. If he continues to refuse, I'll assess the situation in the next rounds and consider selling to John if the negotiations become unproductive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is still a great deal considering the value to you. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with Compromise:** I'm countering with a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify the higher price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** I'm using language that encourages further negotiation and finding a solution that works for both of us.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to meet Bob halfway while still protecting my minimum profit margin. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to consider a more aggressive approach in the following rounds, potentially even going down to my minimum price. However, if the negotiation starts to feel unproductive, I'll switch to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,250, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle on $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is close to my previous offer of $9,250 and well above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 6 rounds left, I need to make a decision to maximize my profit.  Accepting this offer ensures a good return.

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer secures a profitable sale and avoids risking further negotiation. There's a chance Bob might not budge further, and I might lose out on a sale altogether. With limited rounds remaining, accepting this offer seems like the most rational choice."
