"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to part with it for $900,000. This reflects the true value of what's being offered.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $700,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still a significant gap from where I see the product's value. I'm willing to consider a final offer from my side: $850,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's worth.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",750000.0,Bob,6,
