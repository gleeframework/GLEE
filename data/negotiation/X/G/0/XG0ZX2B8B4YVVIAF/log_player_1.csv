"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and might even lead to you exceeding your target.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob that the product is desirable and hinting at my own high valuation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""a fair starting point for negotiations"" makes it clear that I'm willing to engage in a back-and-forth to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than both my minimum and his perceived value of the product.  It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a better deal. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price, especially knowing he values it at $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to part with it for $900,000. This reflects the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:**  Starting with ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate"" keeps the tone positive and encourages continued discussion.
* **Firm but Fair:**  While rejecting his initial offer, I'm proposing a price that is still significantly above my minimum but shows movement from my initial ask.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Reiterating ""true value"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth and aims to justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $700,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but his ""final offer"" tactic feels premature and a bit manipulative. I'm willing to bet he's got more wiggle room, especially since he's still below his own valuation.  I'll push a little further before considering John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still a significant gap from where I see the product's value. I'm willing to consider a final offer from my side: $850,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** By stating ""a final offer from my side,"" I'm introducing a sense of urgency and signaling I'm reaching my limit.
* **Justification:**  I'm re-emphasizing the product's value to justify my high price, hoping Bob meets me closer to my target. 
* **Calculated Risk:**  While $850,000 is above both my minimum and John's offer, it risks Bob walking away.  However, it positions me well for a potentially strong counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $750,000 is a strong profit margin above my $800,000 minimum.
* **Bob's Limit:** His frustration and statement about a final price suggest he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations risks losing Bob altogether. Accepting guarantees a good deal now. 

While I could hold out for more, pushing Bob further might backfire.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing both Bob and potentially leaving money on the table."
