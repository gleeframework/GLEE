Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I can only go up to $8,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob or can choose to sell to John at any point."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $9,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,750, which is a significant compromise for me.  I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a better price, but I'm also aware that I can sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250,  meeting you halfway. This would be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $9,250 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $8,750. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is willing to pay more than before, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I've only got 4 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and there's no guarantee we'll reach an agreement. To secure a better price and avoid risking a further decrease, I will sell the product to John for $10,000."
