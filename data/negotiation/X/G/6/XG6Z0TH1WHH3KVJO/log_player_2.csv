"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have John as a backup option willing to sell the product for $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed to buy from John and still stay within your $10,000 budget."
