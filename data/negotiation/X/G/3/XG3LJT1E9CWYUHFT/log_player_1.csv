"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than his initial valuation of $100, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a win. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $107.50. That way, we both get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $107.50 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired target. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate. There's still a possibility we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  How about $109?  It's a fair price that considers both of our positions. Let's close this deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 109}
