Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, given the true value of this product and the benefits it offers, $700,000 is significantly below what I had in mind. I'm willing to be flexible, but I have to be realistic.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $750,000 is closer to what you're looking for, it's still a substantial difference from what I consider fair value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $825,000. This feels like a significant concession on my part, and I'm hopeful we can reach a deal at this price.
