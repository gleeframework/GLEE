Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is significantly higher than my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It gives Bob a good starting point, allowing him to feel like he's getting a good deal while still providing me with a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the first offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the value of the product.  This should show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to undervalue it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $50,000 less than what I can get from John.  It's not ideal, but it's a quick and relatively safe sale.  I'll take it and avoid any further risk of the negotiation falling through."
