"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value and uniqueness of the product you're offering. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $800000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer at this price?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $800000.

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $1100000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
