"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer before I consider other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is better than buying from John, but you can likely get a better deal by rejecting and potentially negotiating with Alice further, or even considering other options."
