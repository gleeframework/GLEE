"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,250,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,280,000. Can we meet in the middle?",1280000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,280,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,315,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1315000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  How about $1,300,000? I'm really trying to work with you here, but I can't go much lower.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the potential for growth.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
