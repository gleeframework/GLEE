"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $11,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This gives you a great deal, and it's fair for me.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $12,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12,250?",12250.0,Bob,4,
