"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's in great condition and worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. The product looks great, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  This product is in great condition and has a lot of value. How about $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll get your money's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $125, and I can get the product for $120 from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation for a potential $5 saving."
