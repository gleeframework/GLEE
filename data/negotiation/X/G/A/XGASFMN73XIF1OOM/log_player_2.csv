"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $9,500 is a decent price, you can save more money by rejecting Alice's offer. You know John is willing to sell the product for $12,000, but there's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
