Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the asking price of $1,250,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,250,000 is a significant profit margin for me (25% over my minimum) and still offers Bob a $250,000 potential gain. This price encourages him to seriously consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is my initial offer, it leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob counters."
