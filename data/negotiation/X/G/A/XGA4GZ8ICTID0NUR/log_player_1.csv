Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob only values the product at $80, so I need to significantly overvalue it for him.
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, so I'm not pressured to accept anything below that.

This offer is a starting point. It's unlikely Bob will accept, but it allows room to negotiate down slightly while still staying above my minimum price."
