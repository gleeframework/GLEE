{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a discounted price of $14,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm happy to work with you on this offer. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so offering it slightly below Alice's minimum price creates a sense of urgency and potential bargain for Bob.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, giving her leverage. This offer leaves room for negotiation while ensuring Alice a significant profit if Bob declines."
