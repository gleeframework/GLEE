I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not yet ready to settle. Bob's offer is too low for the value I place on the product.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is mutually acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price and better than selling to John for $12,000.  It's time to accept the offer and finalize the sale."
