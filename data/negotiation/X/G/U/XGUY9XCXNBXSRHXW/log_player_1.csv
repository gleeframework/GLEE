Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to me is significantly higher. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my value. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, I'm still not there yet. I'm prepared to offer $8,750, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is a little closer, I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can push Bob a bit higher before I consider selling to John. I'll counteroffer and see what happens."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still too far off from what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875. This is a fair compromise considering we're both trying to find a solution.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still hoping to close this deal at $8,800. This is just a small step further from your last offer, and I believe we're close to a mutually agreeable price.  Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer for $8,800. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my value. It's risky to continue negotiating as I'm only a few rounds away from having to sell to John, which would be a much better deal for me, but I'm also concerned about running out of time and not getting any deal at all.  I'll take the $8,800 and hope that I can find a better deal in the future."
