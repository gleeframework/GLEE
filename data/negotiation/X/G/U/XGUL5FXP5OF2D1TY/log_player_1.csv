I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a fair price that gives Bob a good deal while also allowing me to earn significantly more than my minimum value of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a decent amount, while also being more attractive to Bob than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $95 is not as good as I hoped, it's still significantly more than selling to John. I'm accepting Bob's offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential losses."
