"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $1,200,000.  There's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to propose a lower price and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  A counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer is also well within Bob's budget and significantly lower than the price offered by John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay.  There's still potential to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to continue to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of trying to save as much as possible while remaining within his budget.  Increasing the counteroffer by $100,000 shows good faith, but still keeps the price significantly lower than Alice's last offer and well within what Bob is willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would prefer to pay less, Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a reasonable price.  It's a significant savings compared to buying from John, and continuing to negotiate may not result in a better price.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product without risking a stalemate or being forced to pay John's higher price."
