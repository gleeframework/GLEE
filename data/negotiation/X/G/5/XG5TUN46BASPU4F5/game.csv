"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this price accurately reflects the product's value and future potential for your business.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
