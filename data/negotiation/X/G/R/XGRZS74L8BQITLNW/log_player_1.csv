# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but it's more in line with my budget.

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $1,750,000. Accepting this offer gives me a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
