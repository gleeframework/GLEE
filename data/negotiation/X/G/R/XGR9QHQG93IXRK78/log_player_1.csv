**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently making small increases in his offers, indicating he's unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I might be able to squeeze a little more out of him, it's not worth the risk of him walking away and me losing out on the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
