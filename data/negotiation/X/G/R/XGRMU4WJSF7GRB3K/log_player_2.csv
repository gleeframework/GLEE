"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  He should counteroffer Alice and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, and $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is my final offer in this range, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still get the product for $1,000,000 from John, and there's still room to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  He should make a counteroffer and see if he can reach a price closer to his target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice is now offering $1,250,000, which is still higher than John's price of $1,000,000. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice.  It's better to secure the product at a lower price from John."
