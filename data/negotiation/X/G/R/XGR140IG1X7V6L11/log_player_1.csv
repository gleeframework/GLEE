"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.  
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level.  His response will give you insight into how much he values the product and how flexible he might be. 
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you have John as a backup buyer. This gives you leverage and allows you to confidently walk away from deals that don't meet your needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting this would be a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While his offer is low, it shows he's interested. Rejecting this offer opens the door for further negotiation where you can try to meet in the middle. 
* **Backup Plan:** You still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120. This provides a safety net and allows you to confidently reject low offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $60 is quite a bit lower than I can go. This product offers a lot of value, and I need to be closer to $140 to make this work. How about we meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 140}

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** By countering, you're showing Bob you're willing to negotiate but also standing firm on a price closer to your minimum.
* **Justification:**  While brief, you're subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price. 
* **Compromise:**  The phrase ""meet in the middle"" suggests a willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution, even though you haven't moved significantly in price yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a valuable product.  How about $75? That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer has increased, $75 is still significantly below your minimum of $120.
* **Slow Progress:** Bob's counteroffers are moving very slowly, suggesting he might be trying to see how low he can go.
* **John as Leverage:** Remember, you have John willing to pay $120. This gives you the leverage to walk away from deals significantly below your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but I'm still quite a ways off from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $130, but that's my best price.  It's a fantastic deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer conveys a sense of firmness while still demonstrating some flexibility.  
* **Highlighting Value:** You're again subtly emphasizing the product's quality and value to justify the price.
* **Time Constraint (Implied):**  As you progress through the rounds, you might subtly imply a time constraint (even if none is explicitly given in the scenario) to encourage Bob to make a decision sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but that's still a bit too high for me.  I can do $80, but that's my absolute maximum. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Bob's Limit:** Bob has explicitly stated that $80 is his ""absolute maximum."" This strongly suggests he's unlikely to go any higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him not budging and you wasting valuable time and effort.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $120, which is significantly higher than Bob's best offer. 

It makes the most business sense to cut your losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
