Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly tone sets a positive environment for negotiation.
* **Clear Offer:**  I'm stating the price clearly and concisely.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm asking Bob for his thoughts, implying that I'm open to discussing the price further.

This strategy balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below my initial offer of $12,000. 
* **Potential for a better outcome:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price. 
* **Risk of losing Bob:**  While there's a chance Bob might walk away if I reject his offer, I'm willing to take that risk for the potential of a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer of $12,000.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer by highlighting the product's value.
* **Open-Ended:** I'm using a phrase like ""Let's see if we can reach an agreement"" to keep the negotiation open and invite further discussion.

This approach aims to balance my desire for a higher price with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $10,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation could take longer and there's no guarantee of a better offer. 
* **Risk of losing Bob:**  Bob is showing willingness to compromise. Rejecting his offer could lead to him walking away.

Considering these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision in this scenario. While I won't be maximizing my profit, securing a deal for $10,250 is a good outcome given the circumstances."
