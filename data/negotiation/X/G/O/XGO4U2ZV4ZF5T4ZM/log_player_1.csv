Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This is a starting offer that is well above my minimum price of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, there's a good chance he'll be willing to pay a bit more than my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price and significantly higher than selling to John. It's a good deal for me, so I'll accept it."
