"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, $825000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product.  This represents a significant price drop from your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $800000 just yet.
