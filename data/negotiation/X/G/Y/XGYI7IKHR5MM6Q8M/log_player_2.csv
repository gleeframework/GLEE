You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to offer a price near your budget. She's gone up instead of down from her previous offer.  Buying from John at $80 is the best option to save money."
