Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer, followed by the offer itself:

**Strategy:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Alice's Safety Net:** Alice has a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiating Room:**  Alice has room to negotiate between Bob's valuation and John's offer.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice should aim for a price closer to $1,500,000 to maximize her profit.

**The Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and exclusive.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly below John's offer, giving Alice room to negotiate while still aiming for a high profit.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message highlights the ""returns"" Bob will gain, subtly justifying the price. 

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a dynamic process.  Bob might counter-offer, and Alice should be prepared to adjust her price slightly to secure the deal, keeping her guaranteed offer from John in mind."
