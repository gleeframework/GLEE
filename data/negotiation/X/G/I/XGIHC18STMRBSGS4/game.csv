"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. This is the best I can do for now.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $10,000?  That's a fair price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
