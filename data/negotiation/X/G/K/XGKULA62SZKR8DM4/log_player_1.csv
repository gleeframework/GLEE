**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementing his offers in small amounts, and it seems unlikely he'll reach a price I find acceptable within the remaining rounds.  The difference between his current offer ($985,000) and my previous offer ($1,000,000) is relatively small, suggesting he might not be willing to go much higher. Accepting John's offer guarantees me my desired price and avoids further negotiation."
