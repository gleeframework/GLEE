"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better. He has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible and knows he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  It's in his best interest to negotiate with Alice and see if he can get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I still believe the product is worth more to me than $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired price. He can still try to negotiate a lower price, as he knows John is willing to sell for $1,000,000. There's room to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000, which is a good price for both of us.  It's closer to my budget and still gives you a good return. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,125,000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible and is within striking distance of his target price.  While $1,125,000 is a good offer, he can likely get a bit lower with another counteroffer.  He also knows he can always go to John if this deal falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but I'm still a bit over budget at $1,125,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,110,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and we're getting very close to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1110000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,110,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $1,120,000. This is the lowest price I can accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the closest Alice has come to Bob's target price.  While he'd like to save an extra $10,000, he needs to weigh the risk of continuing to negotiate against the certainty of getting the product for $1,120,000.  He also needs to consider that he has only 3 rounds left and could potentially end up buying from John at $1,000,000 if he's not careful.  It's a good deal for Bob, and the risk of continuing to negotiate is too high."
