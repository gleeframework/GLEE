Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering your product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. How about we aim for $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
The product is worth $1,200,000 to me, and Bob's offer is below that. I have 10 rounds, so there's room for negotiation.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a compromise.
