Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer.  While $60 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Even though Alice's offer is close to my limit, I'll try to negotiate a slightly better deal. I'm willing to go up a little from my previous offer, but I won't accept anything over $80."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $80.  That's a good price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has met my upper limit, and there's no point in trying to negotiate further. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at the best possible price."
