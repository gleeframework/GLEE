**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is slowly moving towards my price. I need to hold firm to get a price closer to $18,000. We're past the halfway point in negotiations, but I'm willing to risk another round or two."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go substantially higher, and I've reached my limit for negotiation. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $15,000. While I could try squeezing Bob for another round or two, it's not worth the risk of him walking away and leaving me with nothing."
