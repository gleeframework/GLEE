Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA)"":**  The prices at which both you and Bob would benefit from a deal exist between $800,001 and $1,199,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth in the market."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Starting at $1,100,000 sets a firm anchor point and leaves you room to negotiate down slightly if needed.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""pleased to offer"" and ""fair deal"" project confidence in your product's value.
* **Market Value:** By mentioning ""worth in the market,"" you subtly remind Bob that others might be willing to pay more.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could start with a slightly lower offer if you want to increase the chances of a quick deal, but always be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet your minimum price."
