"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $160, so I'm offering it to you for $145. What do you think?

You have three options:

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $145 is a reasonable compromise. It's unlikely I'll get a better deal from Alice, and it's better than John's price of $150."
