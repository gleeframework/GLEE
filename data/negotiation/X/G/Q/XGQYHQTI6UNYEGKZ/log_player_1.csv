Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have strong interest from another buyer."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, you can afford to start high.  Bob's perceived value of $10,000 is less important than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning another buyer (John) introduces a sense of competition and urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to you, the message implies it's worth a significant amount, justifying the high price.

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, you'd likely have multiple back-and-forths with Bob, allowing for adjustments based on his reactions."
