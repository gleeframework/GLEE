"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I think it's worth $120, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the offer positively by highlighting the product's value and offering a discount. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $110 is a good starting point that allows for some negotiation without immediately reaching my minimum.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit while keeping in mind the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and me having to sell to John for $100.  By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I'm hoping to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain some leverage and potentially get a higher price in subsequent rounds.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not willing to settle for a price below my minimum. This will hopefully encourage Bob to counter with a higher offer in the next round. While I have the option of selling to John for $100, I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $90. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Leaving room for a deal:** $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, allowing for further negotiation if needed.

**Strategy:**

By meeting halfway, I'm hoping to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. The counteroffer still leaves some room for negotiation, but it also signals that I'm not willing to go much lower.  I'm aiming for a quick resolution while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $97.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for higher offer:** Bob is showing some flexibility, indicating he might be willing to go higher. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to keep pushing for a better price.

**Strategy:**

While $97.50 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I want to see if I can get Bob to go even higher. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, but still above my minimum, in an attempt to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $102.50. This is still a good deal considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 102.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession by dropping my price from $105 to $102.50. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still above minimum:** $102.50 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.

**Strategy:**

By making a small concession while remaining above my minimum, I aim to encourage Bob to accept this offer.  I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob seems unwilling to budge much higher, and I'm unlikely to get a better price in the remaining rounds. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is my minimum acceptable amount.

**Strategy:**

I've reached a point where the potential gain from further negotiation is too risky. It's more advantageous to secure the guaranteed profit from John rather than risk losing out on a better deal with Bob."
