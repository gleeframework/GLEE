Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $200 is significantly higher than your minimum of $150, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's not too high:**  A price too high might scare Bob away immediately. 
* **It opens the conversation:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $150 is your minimum, it's worth trying to get a bit more.  Bob has expressed interest, so there's room for a counter-offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $150 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $175?  That would be fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway! However, $175 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $160 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is a good compromise. It's above your minimum of $150, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher.  Accepting this offer means we get a good deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to John."
