"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $10,000 to you, and both Alice and John are offering it at that price, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. Buying from John is the same outcome."
