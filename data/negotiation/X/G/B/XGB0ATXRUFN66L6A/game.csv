"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it for $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects its worth and offers a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a little steep.  How about we start the conversation at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.  Let's consider $1,025,000.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.  Perhaps we could settle on a price of $960,000. This offer represents a significant investment from my end while acknowledging the value of your product.",960000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Your offer is getting closer, but we're still a fair bit apart. To meet you closer to the middle, I propose $1,000,000 even.  This considers your budget while reflecting the product's inherent value.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
