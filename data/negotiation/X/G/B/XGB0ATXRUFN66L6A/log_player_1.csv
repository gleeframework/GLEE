"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it for $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects its worth and offers a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a little steep.  How about we start the conversation at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both your minimum and his stated value. While his offer is much lower than ideal, it confirms his strong interest in the product. It's too early to settle for his low initial offer or to sell to John. A counteroffer is the best strategy to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.  Let's consider $1,025,000."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.  Perhaps we could settle on a price of $960,000. This offer represents a significant investment from my end while acknowledging the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is increasing, it's still too far below its value to you. You're aiming for a much higher price, and settling for $960,000 at this stage would leave a significant amount of money on the table. You're willing to negotiate further with Bob, but you have a strong fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Your offer is getting closer, but we're still a fair bit apart. To meet you closer to the middle, I propose $1,000,000 even.  This considers your budget while reflecting the product's inherent value."",
