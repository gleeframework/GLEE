"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. My maximum budget is $80, so I would like to propose a price of $90 if you're willing to consider it.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. This is my best price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to accept $110. I am willing to pay up to $80 for this product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between these prices?",85.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to sell the product for $80, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $150, and I think you're missing out on a great opportunity by not taking it.",150.0,Alice,9,
