"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product as close to his maximum budget of $8,000 as possible. Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,800 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and Alice has come down slightly.  This counteroffer of $9,000 shows a continued willingness to meet in the middle, while staying within a reasonable distance of Bob's preferred price.  It's likely Alice will accept this offer or come down just slightly, making it a good deal for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has only come down by $300 from her previous offer.  This indicates she is unlikely to budge further, making it unlikely Bob will get the product for under $9,000.  Since John is offering the product for $8,000, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John and save $1,500."
