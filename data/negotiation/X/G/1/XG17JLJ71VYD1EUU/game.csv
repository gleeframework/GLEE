"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still very interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a significant concession from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product, and it's a significant saving for me. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
