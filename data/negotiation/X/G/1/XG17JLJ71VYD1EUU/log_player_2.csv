"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to you today. I'll sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still too high. You have a lot of room to negotiate.
* It's better to try and get a better price from Alice."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still very interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a significant concession from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.  While you could buy from John, it's not the most financially savvy move at this point."
