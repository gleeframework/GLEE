Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its rarity and potential benefits. What do you think?,2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure if the product is worth $2000000 to me. I'm willing to consider a price of $1400000, which is still a significant amount, but more in line with my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1750000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1750000. I'm willing to go up to $1600000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this price?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1650000. This is as close to your target price as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, but I was thinking maybe we could discuss a price of $1580000. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",1580000.0,Bob,6,
