"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This should be attractive to Bob, as it's less than what the product is worth to him, but also leaves some room for me to increase my profit if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while also pushing for a higher price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer, which is still a good price for me. I'm accepting it to secure the deal and avoid further negotiations. There's a chance I could get a slightly higher price with more rounds, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
