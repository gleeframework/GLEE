Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on the price, she's unlikely to reach $120 or lower. Buying from John guarantees the best price with the remaining rounds."
