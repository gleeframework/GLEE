"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth that much to you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up at that price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at the maximum price Bob is willing to pay. There's no benefit to accepting her offer. Since John is also selling the product for the same price, Bob can buy from John with the same outcome but potentially less hassle."
