Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum price point, but it's a good sign that he's interested. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling below my target price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm at my limit with $13,000. This product is truly unique and valuable, and I'm confident you won't find another like it at this price. It's your decision, but I'm not willing to go any lower."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still hesitant to sell for less than $13,000. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap. I'm still confident I can get a higher price, but I'm also aware that we're getting close to the end of the negotiations."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $12,700 is the absolute lowest I can go.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe this product is worth it. This is my final offer, and I'm hopeful we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12700}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $12300 for the product. Can you reconsider and meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,300.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum price point. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm not confident that I can secure a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees me a reasonable profit, even if it's not the maximum I hoped for."
