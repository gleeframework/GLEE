"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I believe is worth a great deal to you. My asking price is $1400000, which is still below its potential value to you.  This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I will be selling it to another buyer for $1000000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
