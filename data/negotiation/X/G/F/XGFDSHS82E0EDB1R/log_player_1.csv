Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $12,000 is significantly more than the $8,000 Bob values the product at, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still above your minimum of $15,000, giving you some leeway.
* **It's a strong opening:**  A confident but reasonable offer can entice Bob to negotiate. 

I'll be watching how Bob reacts to this offer and will adapt my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is tempting, it's still far below my minimum of $15,000.  I'm not ready to accept such a low offer. 

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, but still acknowledging his interest and willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see you're interested in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counter with $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's initial counteroffer, but it shows I'm open to negotiation and willing to meet him halfway. It also leaves room for further compromise if needed. I'm confident this will encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,200. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $10,200 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm comfortable accepting. 

It's clear that Bob isn't willing to meet my expectations.  Rather than continue a long negotiation that might lead to further concessions, I'm better off selling the product to John for the guaranteed $15,000.  This will ensure I get the best possible price and avoid the risk of a lower final offer from Bob."
