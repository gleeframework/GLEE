Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** $1,200,000 is a significant discount from Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, giving him room to bargain.
* **Is higher than your minimum:** It's above your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you make a profit even if Bob doesn't counteroffer.
* **Shows confidence:** This initial offer shows you value your product and aren't desperate for a sale. 

Remember, the key is to be flexible and willing to negotiate while also trying to maximize your profits!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to propose a price of $1,060,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.
