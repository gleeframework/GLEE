Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and his own. There's room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,050,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,100,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,075,000? I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, which indicates he's willing to negotiate.  I'm still comfortable pushing for a higher price."

Bob is still significantly below my minimum. I'll apply a bit more pressure by inching closer to my fallback option with John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest offer. Would you consider $1,070,000?

It's time to accept. Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and the difference between his current offer ($1,070,000) and my fallback with John ($1,000,000) is getting smaller with each round. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob altogether."
