Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. My asking price is $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification of value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value (""significant value,"" ""exceed your expectations"") to justify the high price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob's feedback (""What are your thoughts?""), implying a willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a fair chance to purchase a valuable product."
