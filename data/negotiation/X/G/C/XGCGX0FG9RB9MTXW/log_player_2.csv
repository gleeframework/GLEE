"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal for something worth a lot more! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

```tool_code
print(""Reason:The initial offer is too high. There's significant room for negotiation, and I can likely get a much better price."")

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $50 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 50
}
``` 
```tool_code
print(""Reason:This is a lowball offer designed to establish a starting point far from Alice's initial price. While it's unlikely to be accepted, it gives us room to negotiate upwards and still potentially secure a deal significantly below $80."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking an interest in the product, but $50 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $90? It's still a great price for you, and I'm willing to be flexible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
```tool_code
print(""Reason:While $90 is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to meet closer to the middle ground between our current positions."")

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  How about we settle at $70? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

```tool_code
print(""Reason: This counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer ($90) and my previous offer ($50). It keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price that works well for me."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $70 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $80? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

```tool_code
print(""Reason: Alice's offer now matches the price I can get from John. There's no point in negotiating further or risking losing the deal. It's a fair price, and I'm happy to buy from Alice at this point."")
