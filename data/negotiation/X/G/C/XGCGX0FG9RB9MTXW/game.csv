"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $50 for it. What do you think?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking an interest in the product, but $50 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $90? It's still a great price for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  How about we settle at $70? That seems like a fair compromise.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $70 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $80? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",80.0,Alice,5,
