"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $875,000. This price still reflects the value I believe it holds, but I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
