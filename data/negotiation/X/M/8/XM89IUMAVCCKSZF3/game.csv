"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $11,000 is quite a bit below the true value of this product. To find a middle ground, I could let it go for $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a strict budget in mind.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  $12,000 is quite close to my bottom line, and I'm hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal: $12,500.  This offer takes into account your budget constraints while recognizing the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
