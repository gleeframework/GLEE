}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about $72? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While we could likely negotiate a lower price, Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, and $72 is a good price, saving us $28 from John's offer and $8 from Alice's original offer.  It's generally better to secure a reasonable deal than to risk it for a potentially minimal gain."
