"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still reflects the significant value this product holds. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. This price is closer to my target, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still not a price that works for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000.  I'm confident this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  We're getting closer!",1250000.0,Alice,5,
