"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects both of our interests.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:**  Starting with a price close to my minimum desired value ($1,500,000) but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows for a potential compromise.
* **Value to Bob:**  The offer is significantly less than my minimum, but still potentially valuable to Bob given his assessment of $800,000. 
* **Message Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes mutual benefit. This builds rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Negotiation:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price. There are still 8 rounds remaining, and I can potentially leverage John's offer as a bargaining chip.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss for me. While selling to John guarantees my minimum, I want to see if I can secure a higher price through negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still reflects the significant value this product holds. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  My counteroffer is a significant step down from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. This shows my willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum desired value. 
* **Justification:** I explain my counteroffer with a clear justification, emphasizing the product's value and the need for a price that reflects it. 
* **Positive Tone:** I keep the message positive and collaborative, focusing on finding a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Time Pressure:** I don't mention John or the limited rounds, but the subtle implication of ""finding a solution"" suggests that time is a factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. This price is closer to my target, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, even though he has increased his offer slightly.
* **Negotiation:** I'm still willing to negotiate with Bob as there's room for further compromise, and there are still 6 rounds remaining. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John would guarantee my minimum, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential Leverage:** I can use John's offer as a bargaining chip in the next round to encourage Bob to come up with a higher offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still not a price that works for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000.  I'm confident this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  We're getting closer!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is still higher than his offer but lower than my previous offer, showing a genuine attempt to meet halfway.
* **Justification:** I emphasize finding a mutually beneficial agreement and highlight the product's value. This reinforces the idea of a fair deal. 
* **Positive Tone:** I use encouraging language like ""getting closer"" to maintain a positive and collaborative atmosphere. 
* **Time Pressure:** While I'm not explicitly mentioning the time limit, the phrase ""Let's try to find a solution..."" subtly suggests that time is of the essence."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This price is getting closer to my target, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is $1,200,000, which is only $50,000 below my previous counteroffer. 
* **Time Pressure:** We are in round 6, and with only 4 rounds remaining, I don't have much time to negotiate further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While my ideal price is still higher, accepting this offer will secure me a significant profit of $700,000. Rejecting it could lead to further negotiation and potentially a lower price or no deal at all.  
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum, but it's unlikely that I can achieve a higher price with him. 

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer is the most rational decision, balancing a reasonable profit with the risk of losing a deal altogether."
