"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $650,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to work towards a mutually agreeable price.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be closer to my bottom line.  Would you be willing to consider $875,000?  This would represent a significant compromise on my initial asking price.",875000.0,Alice,5,
