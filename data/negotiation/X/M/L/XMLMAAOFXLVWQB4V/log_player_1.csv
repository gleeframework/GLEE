Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we settle on $1,300,000? This price still allows you to get a great value for the product, and it gives me a more comfortable profit margin. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $1,250,000? This price should be more comfortable for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and provides a decent profit. Accepting this offer avoids further negotiation and secures a sale."
