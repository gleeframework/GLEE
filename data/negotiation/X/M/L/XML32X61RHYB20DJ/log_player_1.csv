Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 
I'm starting with a high price, hoping to get close to Bob's value while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $120 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price without having to go through more rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $125 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price and we've been through several rounds of negotiation. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit while avoiding further potential delays or complications."
