Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? I'm really interested in this product and would like to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm not desperate to sell and can still get $10,000 from John. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you, too. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,625? I really like the product and would like to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,625.

While $8,625 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and go with $8,687.50? I believe this is a fair price that reflects both of our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8687.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to try to get even closer to my target price. Would you be willing to go to $8,600? I think this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

We're running out of time, and Bob's offer is still too low.  I'd rather sell to John and get my target price than risk getting stuck with a price lower than my minimum."
