Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. It's a good starting point that allows for negotiation and is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm hoping Bob finds it reasonable enough to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $150 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $200.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see where it goes."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm offering $175, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a decent price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $160 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Since I can always sell to John for $150, accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a slightly higher profit and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
