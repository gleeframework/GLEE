"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, hoping to get close to my ideal price.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm starting with a significant markup.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I hope to earn.  I'm going to counteroffer, but I'll be more flexible this time.  I'll try to meet him halfway and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good amount for me. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is close to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer and see if we can find a middle ground. I'm running out of rounds, so I need to be more aggressive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $15,000. This is my absolute minimum, and if Bob rejects, I'll sell to John for the same amount.  I'm hoping Bob recognizes the value of the product and accepts this offer.  I'm confident I can get this price."
