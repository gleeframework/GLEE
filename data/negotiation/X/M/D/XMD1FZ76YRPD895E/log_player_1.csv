{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **It's a significant discount:** The offer is $100,000 lower than my minimum acceptable price, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still $100,000 of potential profit for Bob, incentivizing him to consider the offer.
* **It's bold enough:**  It's not a ""giveaway"" price, demonstrating the value of the product. 

By offering this price, I'm opening the negotiation and seeing how Bob responds. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or simply sell to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a bit lower than what you're asking, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would leave me with a loss. It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It meets Bob halfway:** It's $100,000 higher than Bob's offer but $100,000 lower than my initial offer.
* **It's still profitable:**  It's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **It highlights the value:** The message emphasizes the value of the product to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000, so I'll offer $950,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  The risk of further negotiation is too high, as Bob might continue to lower his offer. 

Selling to John guarantees me the maximum profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
