"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. How about $8,500? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $9,250? I think that's a fair price that works for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again. How about $9,000? I think that's a fair price that's within our both budgets.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. How about $9,250 again? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.",9250.0,Alice,5,
