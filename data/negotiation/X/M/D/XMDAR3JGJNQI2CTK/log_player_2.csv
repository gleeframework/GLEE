"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a significant discount. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
