"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000.  It's a valuable asset that I know will be beneficial to your operations.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to come in a bit lower.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's initial counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's opening price, but still leaves room for negotiation.

This counteroffer also keeps Bob within his budget, as he's willing to pay up to $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This price still allows for a good profit for me and leaves room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's continue the conversation and see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and leaves room for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating his willingness to compromise.

Bob is also keeping the offer within his budget and trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1090000.  This price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's keep the conversation going. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, Bob is still closer to his target price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially secure a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further, and Bob is within his budget to continue exploring those options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm ready to pay $1,080,000 for the product. This represents a good value for me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's finalize this deal and avoid any further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, demonstrating his willingness to compromise while staying within his budget. This offer is a significant move closer to Alice's latest proposal and shows Bob's commitment to closing the deal. By emphasizing a ""final"" offer, Bob might incentivize Alice to accept, as continuing to negotiate could risk the deal falling apart."
