"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to come in a bit lower.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for a deal that leaves me with a loss. I believe I can still secure a better price by continuing negotiations."

Let's continue the conversation and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1075000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and leaves room for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to increase his offer, it's still below my desired minimum price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal by continuing negotiations.  We have more rounds, and I'm not ready to settle for less than what I believe the product is worth."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000.  This price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 1090000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm ready to pay $1080000 for the product. This represents a good value for me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's finalize this deal and avoid any further negotiation.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is finally above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  accepting this offer ensures a profitable deal and avoids further negotiations. We've already reached a good point, and there's a risk that further negotiations might lead to a lower offer or even a stalemate."
