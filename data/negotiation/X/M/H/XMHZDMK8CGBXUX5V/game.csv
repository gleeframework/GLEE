"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I hope we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $1,900,000? This reflects the true value while leaving room for a profitable deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a substantial price for the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we should meet somewhere in the middle.  Let's agree on $1,600,000.  This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
