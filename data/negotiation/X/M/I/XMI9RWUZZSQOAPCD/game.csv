"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $105 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and sell the product to you for $112.50. It's still a good deal for both of us.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $112.50, but I'm still a little too high for me. Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to pay $111.25.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",111.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $112.00. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",112.0,Alice,7,
