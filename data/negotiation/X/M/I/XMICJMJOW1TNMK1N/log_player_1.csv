Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to give him some room to negotiate.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I want to leave room for both of us to compromise while still maximizing my profit. 
* **Backup Plan:** John is a great backup, but I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob for a slightly higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** While I'm open to negotiation, I need to maintain a higher price point. Accepting his offer would result in a considerable loss for me.
* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $13,500.  
* **John's Offer:**  While John offers a higher price, I want to see if I can get closer to that value with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is a bit lower than I can accept right now, I'm willing to go down to $12,500.  This price reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my minimum acceptable price.
* **Compromise:**  $12,500 is a good compromise between my initial offer of $13,500 and Bob's offer of $11,000.
* **Motivating Bob:**  The message emphasizes the ""good deal"" aspect, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Backup Option:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential Loss:** While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, or I'll need to make further concessions.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, with no guarantee of a better outcome.
* **John's Offer:** While John offers a higher price, I'm comfortable with the potential profit from this deal with Bob. 

**Conclusion:**  Given the proximity of the offer to my minimum, the potential risk of further negotiation, and the time investment, I believe accepting Bob's offer is the best decision."
