```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000.  It also leaves room to potentially come down in price if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

$10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

I'm counter-offering with $17,500.  This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for that low. I will try to negotiate a higher price."

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal."
