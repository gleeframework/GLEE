"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $9,000 is too far below the value of this product. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price still gives you a great deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $11,000. How about we meet at $10,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you meet me in the middle?",10500.0,Bob,4,
