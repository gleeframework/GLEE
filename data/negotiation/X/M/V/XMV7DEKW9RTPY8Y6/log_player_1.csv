Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the substantial benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""immense value"" to justify the high price.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate. This allows you to potentially secure a deal above your minimum, even if Bob counters with a lower offer. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially adjust your price, but always keep in mind your $1,000,000 baseline from John."
