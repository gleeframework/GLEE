Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $1,500,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum price. This means a deal is impossible unless one of you changes your valuation.

**Strategy**

Since a deal within Bob's valuation is impossible, you have two options:

1. **High Anchor & Walk Away:** Start with a very high price to potentially influence Bob's perception of the product's value. You'll likely have to walk away and sell to John.

2. **Direct Sale to John:** Knowing there's no ZOPA, skip the negotiation with Bob and sell directly to John.

**The Offer (Option 1)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its rarity and value, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** The $1,800,000 price is significantly above both your minimum and Bob's maximum. It might make him reconsider his valuation.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, which might nudge Bob to act quickly.

**Important Notes**

* This strategy is unlikely to lead to a sale with Bob.
* You'll need to be prepared to walk away and sell to John at your minimum price.
* Option 2 (selling directly to John) is the most rational choice in this scenario to guarantee your desired profit."
