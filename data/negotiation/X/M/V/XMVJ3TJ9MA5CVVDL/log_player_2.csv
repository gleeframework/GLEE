You can definitely do better than $1,200,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."

$1,100,000 is still a bit high, but it's closer to my desired price.  Let's keep negotiating."

At this point, it's getting close to my limit, and I'm confident I can't get much lower.  I'll take the offer and save $425,000 compared to buying from John."
