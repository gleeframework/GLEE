"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $1,025,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. My next counteroffer is $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
