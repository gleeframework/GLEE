Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500.  I think it would be a valuable asset to you, and this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without him rejecting the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves a little room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially still landing a better price than John's offer. 
* **Confidence:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, subtly justifying the price."
