``` 

This offer sets a starting point that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but not so high that it would immediately deter him. It also includes a friendly message to encourage engagement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price and offer it to you for $9,500.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $8,750? That's a significant jump from my last offer and puts us closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $10,000. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm closer to meeting you halfway, $8,750 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $9,000. If that works for you, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm running the risk of going back and forth with Bob indefinitely.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so I will sell to John."
