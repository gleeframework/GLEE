You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as buying from John. Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting it allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice in the future, or at least gather more information about the product's true value."
