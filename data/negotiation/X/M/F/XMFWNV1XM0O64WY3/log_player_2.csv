Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $92 for you, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:

Alice is signaling that she's nearing her lowest price. While you might be able to negotiate a dollar or two less, accepting at $92 secures a good price and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
