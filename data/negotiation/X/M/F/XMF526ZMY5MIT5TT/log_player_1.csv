"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its true value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than what Bob values the product at. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Value:** I emphasize the product's true value to me to justify the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear I'm open to discussion and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting high gives me the best chance of getting a price closer to my desired $1,000,000.
* **Test the Waters:**  Seeing Bob's reaction will reveal how much he's willing to pay.
* **Create Urgency:**  The limited rounds and the possibility of selling to John add pressure for Bob to act."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm confident I can do better with further negotiation, especially with the time pressure.

**Strategy:**

* **Holding Out for More:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiations and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Leveraging John:** The presence of John as an alternative buyer gives me leverage. Bob knows I have options, making him more likely to come up with a higher offer. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my commitment to making this deal work. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob of the product's true value and my commitment to the deal. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** The counteroffer is not too low, leaving me room to negotiate further if necessary. 

**Strategy:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** The counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my desired range.
* **Building Momentum:**  By demonstrating a willingness to compromise, I hope to keep the negotiations moving forward."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum desired price of $1,000,000, I'm still not willing to accept it.  There are a few factors influencing this decision:

* **Value Gap:** There's still a $50,000 gap between Bob's offer and my minimum.  Even though it's a smaller difference, I believe I can close the gap further with continued negotiation. 
* **Time Pressure:** With limited rounds remaining, I'm motivated to push for a better deal.  
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000.  This provides me with the security of knowing that I don't have to settle for anything less than my minimum.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiating for the Best Deal:**  I believe I can achieve a price closer to my desired amount with another round of negotiation.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While there's a risk of failing to reach an agreement, the potential for a higher price justifies continuing negotiations. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  John's offer gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident it's a good investment for you.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm setting my minimum price, making it clear that this is my final offer.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the product's value and the potential return on investment for Bob.
* **Urgency:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by emphasizing that this is the last chance to close the deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  This offer bridges the remaining gap between our prices, aiming to secure a deal at my minimum desired price.
* **Setting a Deadline:**  By stating it's my final offer, I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Appealing to Logic:** I'm focusing on the logical benefits of the deal for Bob, emphasizing the value proposition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only four rounds remaining, the negotiation is becoming increasingly risky. While Bob's offer of $925,000 is closer to my minimum desired price, it's still below my target. 

* **Time Pressure:**  The dwindling number of rounds makes it less likely I can achieve my ideal price.
* **Guarantee vs. Risk:**  John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a safer option than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially getting a lower price.
* **Potential Loss:**  There's a real risk that Bob will continue to make lower offers in the remaining rounds, leaving me with no time to counter.

**Strategy:**

It's crucial to weigh potential gains against the risk of losing out altogether. By selling to John, I guarantee my minimum desired price and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation.  Even though it's not ideal to sell below my original asking price, it's the most prudent decision given the current circumstances."
