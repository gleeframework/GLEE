"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $900000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings you.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

I understand that $1050000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1025000. Can you consider this revised offer?,1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway. I appreciate that. While $1025000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me. Let's split the difference one more time. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this revised offer?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
