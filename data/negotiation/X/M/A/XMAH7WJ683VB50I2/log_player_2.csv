"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product's worth to Alice.  There's potential for a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still higher than the product's worth to Alice. This strategy aims to:

* **Test the waters:** Gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.
* **Set a lower limit:** Establish a starting point for further negotiations.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  Allow for potential agreement without Bob having to pay the full $14,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate.  Bob can still try to get a better deal.  $13,500 is still above the product's value to Alice.  By rejecting this offer, Bob keeps the negotiation moving and potentially pushes Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway.  This strategy aims to:

* **Show commitment:**  Signal to Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product.
* **Find middle ground:**  Try to reach a compromise that is acceptable to both parties.
* **Avoid John's price:**  Continue to avoid having to pay John's higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is continuing to lower her price, showing a willingness to negotiate. $13,750 is still more than the product's worth to Alice, and Bob wants to get a better deal.  By rejecting, Bob keeps the negotiation going and continues to push for a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to increase his offer, but at a smaller increment.  He's trying to:

* **Show progress:** Signal to Alice that Bob is getting closer to her price, increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* **Stay within budget:**  Ensure he doesn't overpay and still has room to negotiate.
* **Avoid John:**  Continue to pursue a better deal than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Bob's Target:**  Alice's offer of $13,800 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $13,250. This suggests that they are almost at a compromise point.
* **Risk of Going Higher:**  Rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer could lead to Alice becoming less willing to negotiate or even increasing her price.
* **Risk of Buying from John:**  While John's price of $15,000 is still within Bob's budget, it's significantly higher than Alice's current offer.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,200.

This decision prioritizes getting the product for a price that is both acceptable and within Bob's budget while minimizing the risk of a deal falling through or having to pay a higher price."
