"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum price and still leaves you with a good profit margin. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's minimum price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. There's no reason to accept the offer in the first round, as Bob has the leverage of a backup option (John).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start a negotiation process and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to my budget. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but realistic:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's desire for a good deal. However, it's still above John's price, indicating Bob's willingness to negotiate without immediately resorting to the backup option.
* **Justified with a reason:**  Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer (""closer to my budget""), which makes it less of a random number and more of a genuine attempt at negotiation.
* **Open to discussion:** Bob ends the message with an open invitation for further discussion (""Let me know what you think""), signaling his readiness to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay, considering John's offer of $1,000,000.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price. There's still room for Alice to come down further, and Bob should aim for that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is my maximum budget and still leaves you with a decent profit. This way, we both get a good deal and close the deal quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** Bob presents his final offer, which is also the price he can get from John. This shows a firm stance while still being reasonable and leaving space for Alice to accept.
* **Emphasizes mutual benefit:** Bob highlights how the offer benefits both parties, closing the deal quickly and ensuring a decent profit for Alice.
* **Calls for action:** Bob ends with a direct question, prompting Alice to make a decision. This puts pressure on her to respond and potentially close the deal."
