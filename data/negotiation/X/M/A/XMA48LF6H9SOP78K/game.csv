"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum price and still leaves you with a good profit margin. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to my budget. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is my maximum budget and still leaves you with a decent profit. This way, we both get a good deal and close the deal quickly. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
