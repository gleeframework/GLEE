Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to my budget. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I'm not willing to drop that much below my minimum price. I'll try to counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is my maximum budget and still leaves you with a decent profit. This way, we both get a good deal and close the deal quickly. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a good deal for both of us. It's above my minimum price and allows me to close the deal quickly."
