"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's valued at $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $13,000. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $11,000. Can you consider that?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about $12,000?  This would give us both a good deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I think $11,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really can't go any higher than that. Can you consider it?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your $11,000 offer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only come down to $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but I really need to be closer to that price. Can you consider going down to $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,6,
