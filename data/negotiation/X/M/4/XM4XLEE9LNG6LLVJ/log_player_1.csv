Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $10,000 (your fallback offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $12,000 
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $2,000 (Bob's value - your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit but also ensure Bob accepts the offer.  Offering a price too close to $12,000 leaves little room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal, potentially leading to rejection.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $11,500. I know how valuable it is and believe this offer represents a great opportunity for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation**

* **Price Point:** $11,500 allows Bob to save $500 and still gives you a significant profit of $1,500.
* **Messaging:** The message emphasizes value and positions the offer as mutually beneficial. 

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly, but always keep your $10,000 minimum in mind."
