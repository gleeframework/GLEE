"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $15000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget, and I value your interest. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $17500. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while getting you a great deal.  What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $15000. Could we perhaps meet in the middle at $16250? This would allow for a fair profit margin for you while staying within my budget.",16250.0,Bob,4,
