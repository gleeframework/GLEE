{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for potential profit while also giving Bob a starting point for counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $15000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's worth trying to negotiate a higher price. You can potentially earn more by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, and I value your interest. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $17,500. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while getting you a great deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $15000. Could we perhaps meet in the middle at $16250? This would allow for a fair profit margin for you while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,250 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and allows you to earn more than your minimum acceptable price."
