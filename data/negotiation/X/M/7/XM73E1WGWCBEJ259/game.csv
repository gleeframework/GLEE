"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Considering its value to me is $10000, I'd be willing to offer $9500.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $9500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9500.  It's fair considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $9500, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
