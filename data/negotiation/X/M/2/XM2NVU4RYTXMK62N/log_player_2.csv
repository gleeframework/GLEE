Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

```
Reasoning: While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $13,000. John offers a guaranteed price of $12,000, which aligns with my goal of saving as much as possible.
