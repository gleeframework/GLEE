{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob and emphasize the value of the product.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for several counteroffers before I need to consider selling to John.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and engaging with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Counteroffer:**  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer in the next round. 
* **John is a backup:** Having John as a backup buyer provides me with a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and can potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects the value of the product and still gives you a great deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price, but not by too much. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, subtly pushing him towards a higher price.
* **Open-ended Question:**  The ending question encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

This strategy aims to reach a mutually acceptable price while still maintaining my goal of maximizing my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $8,750.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my goal of at least $10,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm not yet at a point where I'm comfortable selling for less than my minimum, and there's still potential for a higher counteroffer from Bob. 
* **John is still available:**  Having John as an option provides me with security if negotiations with Bob continue to stall.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and can potentially secure a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,875?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping a significant margin above my absolute minimum. 
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair"" compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially making him more likely to accept.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, emphasizing the potential for a successful deal.

This strategy aims to nudge Bob closer to my desired price while maintaining a reasonable and collaborative atmosphere."
