Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I know it's a great deal for you, and it's also a good price for me.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:** This price is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's valuation of $800,000, giving him a good deal. It's also significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, allowing me to potentially secure a sale and avoid selling to John at the last minute.
* **The message:**  It's friendly and emphasizes the value for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my chances of selling the product while still getting a reasonable price."
