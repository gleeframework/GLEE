Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive messaging:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting the ""great deal"" can incentivize Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* By starting high, I aim to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest and potentially adjust the price in subsequent counteroffers.
*  Having John as a backup option provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120.**  While it's closer than his initial valuation, I'm not desperate to sell and can potentially get a better deal. 
* **The potential of getting a higher price from Bob:** I believe there is room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Next steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $100, but still higher than $90. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate but also maintain my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my original price.  How about $95? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  By offering $95, I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Appealing to fairness:**  Framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" can make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Highlighting the benefit for both:**  Emphasizing that both parties can be satisfied with this price can encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John to guarantee a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $95 is the right price for me. I'd be willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $92 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable value of $120. 
* **Risk of losing a sale:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he might walk away entirely. It's uncertain if further negotiation will lead to a higher price, and I don't want to miss out on a sale altogether. 
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time, which might not be worth it for the potential gain of a few extra dollars.

**Strategy:**

*  By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale that's nearly at my minimum, which is a good outcome considering the possibility of Bob withdrawing from the negotiation. 
*  I'm also avoiding the risk of losing a sale completely."
