"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $10,500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,500? That would work for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I can do $10,250. It's the best I can do, and I think you'll find it's worth every dollar.",10250.0,Alice,5,
