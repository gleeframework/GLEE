"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is closer to the product's true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, what do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can find some common ground there.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
