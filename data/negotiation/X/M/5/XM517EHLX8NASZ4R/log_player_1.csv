{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation, but still leaves room for negotiation if he counters.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $120, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $132.5 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to counteroffer again to see if I can get Bob to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $132.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $134.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize it."", ""product_price"": 134}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on $134. I'm going to have to go with a lower offer. How about $130, or I'll have to consider buying from someone else? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is now offering his initial counteroffer of $130, which is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've made several concessions and it seems like he's not going to budge further. I'd rather sell to John for $150 and avoid further negotiation."
