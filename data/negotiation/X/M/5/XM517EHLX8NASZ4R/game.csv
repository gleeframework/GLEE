"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  That way we both get a good deal.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? Would that work for you?",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $132.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $134.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize it.",134.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on $134. I'm going to have to go with a lower offer. How about $130, or I'll have to consider buying from someone else?",130.0,Bob,6,
