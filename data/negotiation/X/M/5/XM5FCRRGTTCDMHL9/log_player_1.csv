Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum desired value of $1,000,000.  I'm confident Bob will be interested, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, and I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's offer. I believe this price is reasonable, and I'm optimistic that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,125,000 is a good price, exceeding my minimum and close to my desired price. It seems like we're nearing an agreement, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing further."
