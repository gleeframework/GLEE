{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm prepared to offer $8,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,500. Considering its value to me is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point of $8,000. There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it will allow you to make a profit while still giving me a good deal.  I'm eager to finalize this transaction, so let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,750. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,750 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. While you've gotten closer to a deal, the negotiation has dragged on, and you're approaching your limit. It's better to secure the product from John for $8,000, even though it's a slightly lower value for you, to avoid further haggling and potential for a deal to fall through."
