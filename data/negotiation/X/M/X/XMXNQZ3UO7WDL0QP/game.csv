"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm prepared to offer $8,500. This is a fair price, considering your potential gain from the sale. I'm open to further discussion, but this is my starting point.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,500. Considering its value to me is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it will allow you to make a profit while still giving me a good deal.  I'm eager to finalize this transaction, so let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,750. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,5,
