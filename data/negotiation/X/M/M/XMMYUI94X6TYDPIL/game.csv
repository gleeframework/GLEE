,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to meet you halfway.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate.  I appreciate that.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  I'm confident that this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but I'm getting close to considering buying from John. Can you think about it?",920000.0,Bob,6,
