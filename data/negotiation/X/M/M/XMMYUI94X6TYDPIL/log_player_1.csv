{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its true value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** My message is friendly and encouraging.  I highlight the good value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Strategy:** I'm trying to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball.  This starting point is a good compromise between maximizing my profit and maintaining a possible deal with Bob. 

**Important Note:** I'm keeping John as a backup buyer.  If Bob's counteroffers aren't satisfactory, I can always fall back on John for my guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that I can get a better deal through further negotiation, especially since I have John as a backup buyer. 

I will counter Bob's offer and try to bridge the gap between our expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to meet you halfway.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a significant profit margin for me.
* **Message:** My message is still friendly and encouraging, but I'm also firm in my stance. I highlight the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Strategy:** I'm hoping to strike a balance between securing a good deal and keeping the negotiation moving forward. I'm aiming for a deal that's mutually beneficial and avoids a complete stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not a good enough deal for me. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.

I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, or I can always sell to John for $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate.  I appreciate that.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  I'm confident that this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $1,000,000, which is a compromise, but still significantly better than Bob's last offer.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's willingness to negotiate and  frame the price as a fair compromise.
* **Strategy:** This is my final offer before considering John.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'll move on to John to secure my guaranteed minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but I'm getting close to considering buying from John. Can you think about it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $920,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to drop my price any further, especially considering Bob's mention of buying from John.  This indicates that he's not committed to getting a deal with me. 

At this point, it's more beneficial to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000.  Although I'd prefer to maximize my profit, I'm not willing to risk a lower price or a prolonged negotiation.  John provides a secure and profitable option."
