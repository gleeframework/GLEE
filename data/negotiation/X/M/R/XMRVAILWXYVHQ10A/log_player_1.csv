Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}

I'm starting with an offer of $17,000.  This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit. I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's $15,000 offer, but I'm also willing to walk away if Bob isn't willing to negotiate fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's more than John's offer, and it's still above my minimum of $15,000. I'll take it!"
