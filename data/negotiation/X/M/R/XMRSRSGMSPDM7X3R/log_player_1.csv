I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm also hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum value. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

Bob has increased his offer to $1,250,000. While this is still below my initial asking price, it is above my minimum value and also above what John is offering. Therefore, I will accept this offer."
