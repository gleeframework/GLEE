Round 3

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems quite firm in her pricing, and we're running out of rounds. She's consistently rejecting offers below $925,000. While we *might* be able to push her down a little more, the risk of her remaining above our $800,000 limit is too high. John offers a guaranteed way to acquire the product within our budget."
