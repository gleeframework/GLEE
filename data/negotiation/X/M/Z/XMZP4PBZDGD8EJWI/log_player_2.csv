"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I know it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, as I could easily sell it to someone else for $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I will reject Alice's offer. If I accept her offer, I would be paying $1,000 more than I need to. I can get the same product from John for $1,000 less.
