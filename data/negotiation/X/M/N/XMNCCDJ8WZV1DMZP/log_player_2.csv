{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is asking for $170, which is significantly more than your limit. It's better to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is the maximum you're willing to pay for the product, so it's a good starting point for negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $140 is closer to your limit, it's still above what you're comfortable paying.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."

{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a compromise between your maximum price and Alice's last offer. It shows you are willing to negotiate but are still aiming for a price below $140."
