Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and his own. It's clear there's room for negotiation. I should counter.
