Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential value to you. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about we meet halfway at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this easy: $1,000,000 even, and we have a deal.  This is my final offer.  I'm confident you'll get even more value than that out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best possible outcome. Alice has reached her bottom line (the product's actual value to her) and explicitly stated this is her final offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
