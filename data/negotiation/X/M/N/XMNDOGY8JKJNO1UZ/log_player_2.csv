"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
print(""Reason:Alice's offer is way above my budget. I should try to negotiate a much lower price or consider buying from John."")
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $60. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 60} 
```tool_code
print(""Reason:I'm starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This gives me room to increase my offer in later rounds while staying within my budget."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower the price to $90.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
print(""Reason:While Alice is negotiating, $90 is still above my budget. I'll try to bring the price down further in the next round."")
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you consider $70?  That's a fair jump from my previous offer and would make this a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 70}
```tool_code
print(""Reason: I'm moving closer to my maximum budget but leaving some room for negotiation. Offering $70 shows Alice I'm serious while still aiming for a good deal."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $70 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair compromise, and it would still be a great value for you.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
print(""Reason: Alice is getting closer to my acceptable price, but I'm only $5 away from John's price. I'll try one more time to get a better deal from Alice before going with John."")
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for working with me. I'm ready to close this deal if we can agree on a price. How about $75? That's the highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 75} 
```tool_code
print(""Reason: I'm offering a price that's halfway between her last offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm limit close to John's price. It's a final attempt to see if I can get a slightly better deal than John's offer."")
