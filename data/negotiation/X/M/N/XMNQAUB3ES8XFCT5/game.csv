"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
