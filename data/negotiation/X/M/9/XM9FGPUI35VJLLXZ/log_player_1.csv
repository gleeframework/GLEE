""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $15,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:**  You know Bob values the product at $15,000. This is crucial information.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land a price higher than your minimum.
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, so you're not desperate. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward, expressing the value you place on the product and your desired price."
