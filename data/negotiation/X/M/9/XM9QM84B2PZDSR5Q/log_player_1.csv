{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000** is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. 
* This initial offer sets the stage for a potential counter-offer from Bob, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. The best strategy depends on how much you believe Bob is willing to pay and how comfortable you are with the risk of losing the deal. You can adjust the price and message accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target of $950,000. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I'll send a counteroffer that is more in line with my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves some room for you to get a great deal. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial $950,000 while still remaining above my minimum value. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on finding a middle ground, emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob. This approach aims to keep the negotiation amicable and encourages Bob to consider my offer. 

**Key point:** I'm trying to signal that I'm serious about selling to Bob but also willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $875000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is still significantly lower than my desired price of $950,000, but it's getting closer.  It's also higher than John's offer of $800,000. Given that I'm not sure how much more I can squeeze out of Bob, accepting his offer seems like the best option at this point.  It guarantees a sale and secures a price that is higher than my backup option."
