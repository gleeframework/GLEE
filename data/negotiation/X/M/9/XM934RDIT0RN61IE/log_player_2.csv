"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully developed and nurtured, and I know it has the potential to significantly benefit your business. I'm confident that it's worth at least $1 million to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair to both of us - $900,000. This allows you to secure a valuable asset at a considerable discount while giving me a return that reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts, and I'm happy to discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While her message tries to frame the product's value at $1,000,000, you know your maximum is that amount. Paying $900,000 leaves you with very little room for profit. 
* **John's offer provides a baseline:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $1,000,000 from John. This means there's no need to rush into accepting Alice's offer.
* **Negotiation potential:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. She might be willing to come down to a more acceptable range. 

**Next Steps:** After rejecting, you can either wait for a counter-offer from Alice or directly propose a lower price that works better for you."
