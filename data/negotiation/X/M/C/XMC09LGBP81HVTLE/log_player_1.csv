"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love.  My asking price is $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly opening can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Value proposition:**  Even though I don't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, I'm implying it's worth considering by suggesting he'll ""love"" it. 

This strategy aims to create a good starting point for the negotiation while still leaving room for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested, but I can only offer $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $85 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still a chance to get a better price. 
* **Opportunity to counteroffer:**  I can use the next round to propose a price closer to my desired range.

While selling to John for $100 is tempting, it's worth seeing if I can get a higher price from Bob. I have 9 rounds remaining, giving me enough time to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within my range:**  $95 is still above my minimum of $100 and leaves room for a potential compromise.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I want to keep Bob engaged and make him feel like we're working towards a solution.
* **""Middle ground"" suggestion:**  This subtly implies that there's still room for negotiation, prompting Bob to consider a price closer to my desired range.

By offering a counteroffer within my acceptable range and maintaining a friendly tone, I'm aiming to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement without giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer remains below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  While selling to John for $100 is tempting, I have 6 rounds left to potentially get a better deal. 
* **Potential for compromise:**  There's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to reach a compromise closer to my desired price in the next rounds.

It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob, as there's a chance we can reach a deal that benefits us both."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $85 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $85. This shows good faith and signals a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob that I'm still willing to negotiate, but emphasizing that I'm not willing to go lower than $90.
* **Open-ended question:**  ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while maintaining my desired price range. It's a move towards a potential compromise that keeps the negotiation moving forward."
