"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I'd get elsewhere. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $920,000. I'm trying to save as much as I can, and I think this is the best we can do.",920000.0,Bob,4,
