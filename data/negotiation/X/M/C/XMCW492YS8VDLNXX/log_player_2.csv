"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I'd get elsewhere. What do you say?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product.
