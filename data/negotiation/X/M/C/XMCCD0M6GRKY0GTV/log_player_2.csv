"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product, and John is also willing to sell it for the same price, there's no benefit in accepting Alice's offer. You can get the product from John for the same price."
