"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to that.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $11,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the product's worth to me, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",13500.0,Alice,5,
