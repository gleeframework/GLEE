"Hi Alice,  $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  This product is truly top-of-the-line and offers exceptional value. Could you meet me halfway at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you think it's top-of-the-line, but I'm still only comfortable with $11,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm serious about wanting to buy this product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $11,000 is cutting it too close. How about we settle at $12,500? That's my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
