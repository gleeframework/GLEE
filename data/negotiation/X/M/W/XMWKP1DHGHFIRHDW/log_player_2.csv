"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and we're willing to start the negotiation at $135. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: While $135 is a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting and counteroffering allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the starting point, I'm looking to pay closer to $120.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. I am proposing to sell the product for $130. This is higher than your offer but still below my initial asking price. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason:  Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  At $130, it's a good deal for Bob, and he should accept before the price potentially rises again."
