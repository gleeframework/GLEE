# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is significantly higher than the product's value to her ($800,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and try to secure a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This recognizes its worth while still offering you a great deal.
