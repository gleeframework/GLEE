"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  Unfortunately, that price is a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives us room to negotiate upward while still staying well below our $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $130 is still more than we want to pay. We're close enough to our target price that it's worth negotiating a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $110? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference between her last offer ($130) and our previous offer ($100). This keeps the negotiation moving while demonstrating we're willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $110. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $125. It's still a great value, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $125, and we're not willing to pay more than $120.  It's time to cut our losses and go with John's guaranteed offer."
