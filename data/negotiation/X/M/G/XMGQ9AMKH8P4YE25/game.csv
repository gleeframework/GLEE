"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $110. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $125. It's still a great value, and I think you'll really love the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
