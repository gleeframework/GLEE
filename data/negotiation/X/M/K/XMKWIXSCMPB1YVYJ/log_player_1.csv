{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  This leaves room for negotiation and encourages Bob to accept or make a counteroffer.
* **It's a strong opening:**  By offering a price that's not too low, you demonstrate confidence in the value of your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum. While you want to make a deal, accepting this offer would mean losing money.  It's better to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,750 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your ideal price.  Since you have a backup buyer in John who's willing to pay $8,000, it's worth holding out for a better deal. Reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really keen to work with you on this, but $7,750 is still just a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'll come down to $8,250. This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
