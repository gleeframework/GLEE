"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That's a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm really keen to work with you on this, but $7,750 is still just a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'll come down to $8,250. This is my final offer. What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,5,
