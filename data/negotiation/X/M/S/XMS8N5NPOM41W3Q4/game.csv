,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still very interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $11,250, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept?",10750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm running out of room to negotiate, Bob. I can do $11,375, but that's my absolute limit. I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're still interested, this is my final offer. What do you think?",11375.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,375. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500 one last time. If you're willing to accept, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $8,000.",10500.0,Bob,10,
