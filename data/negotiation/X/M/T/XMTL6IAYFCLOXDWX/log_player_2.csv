"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value to us, I am proposing a price of $950,000 for this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than John's price. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, the price point is a bit high for my current budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $650,000."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's opening offer, but it's still within a reasonable range for negotiation. It leaves room to move upwards while aiming to anchor the price lower.
* **Justification:** By mentioning your budget, you provide a reason for the lower offer without revealing your absolute maximum.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your consideration. In order to find a mutually beneficial solution, I would like to propose a price of $725,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved down significantly, indicating willingness to negotiate.  However, her current offer is still higher than our backup price with John. We should continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $725,000 is closer, but to make this work, I'd need to be closer to $680,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 680000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We are moving up in smaller increments now, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate but still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Direct & Open-Ended:** The message is short, direct, and invites Alice's response, encouraging further negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  We're still a good margin below John's price, giving us room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement, Bob. To move forward, I propose a price of $700,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close! Alice is down to $700,000, but that's still slightly above John's price. With several rounds left, it's worth trying to push for a slightly better deal before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close!  How about we split the difference and settle at $690,000? That would work well for me."",
""product_price"": 690000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Offer:** By proposing a split of the difference between her last offer and our last counteroffer, we signal a strong desire to close the deal while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Positive Language:** The message uses positive language (""close,"" ""work well"") to maintain a good atmosphere and encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  We're now just below John's price, creating a sense of urgency without going over our absolute limit."
