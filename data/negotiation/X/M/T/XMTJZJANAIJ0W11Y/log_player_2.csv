"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's definitely worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. This sets a clear boundary and establishes a starting point for negotiation. While Alice might reject this offer, it's the best chance to secure the product at a price that works for me. If she refuses, I can always buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as there's still room for a price that works for both of us. I believe a counteroffer can get us closer to my target price of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $800,000 to $900,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still not willing to go above my maximum budget. This is a reasonable compromise, and it might be enough to convince Alice to accept the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still $200,000 above my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that we might go back and forth for a long time, and I might not be able to get the price down to my target.  Given that John is willing to sell me the product for $800,000, it's a more secure option to buy from him.  I can save myself the time and effort of continuing to negotiate, and I know I'm getting a good deal."
