Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,700,000. This is a higher price than what it's worth to him, but it's still less than what I could get from John. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not going to take a massive loss.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is significantly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than what he offered.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go lower than $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. It's getting closer to what it's worth to him, but I'm not ready to sell that low yet.  I'll counteroffer one more time and see if we can close the gap.  If he rejects, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This is my final offer.  It's a significant compromise, but I'm not willing to go lower.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this and accept my offer. If he doesn't, I'll be selling to John."
