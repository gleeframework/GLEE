"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $18000. It's a great deal and I believe it's worth much more to the right buyer. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $12000 is a tempting price, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of the product. How about we split the difference and settle on $15000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $15000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $13500, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Bob,4,
