"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $12,500. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer the product to you for $12,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",12200.0,Alice,5,
