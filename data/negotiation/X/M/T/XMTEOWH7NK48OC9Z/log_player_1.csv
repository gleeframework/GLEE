"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's a bit above my minimum.  I know Bob values the product at $12,000, so I'm giving him some room to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the farm.  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum.  I still have time to see if I can get a better price from Bob or if I need to go with John's offer.  Let's see if I can negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,000. This is my absolute minimum, but I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway.  I know he values the product at $12,000, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but I'm not going to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $15,000. Let's keep going!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000.  It's a compromise,  but still closer to my minimum than Bob's last offer.  Hopefully, we can reach an agreement this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm only 5 rounds away from the end and John is waiting to buy at my preferred price.  I'm going to try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a compromise, but I'm getting closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will realize he's running out of time and is willing to come up a little more.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John for $15,000.  Bob is getting very close to my minimum, but we're running out of rounds.  It's not worth the risk of him rejecting my offer and me losing out on a guaranteed sale with John."
