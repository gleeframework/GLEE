"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This leaves room for negotiation, but still ensures I make a profit above my minimum price of $120.  I'm confident Bob will be willing to pay more than $80 for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105. It's a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I believe this will be a good middle ground and encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with the profit margin. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get a higher price.  There's still a good chance he'll come up a little more, and I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to stick to my guns and counter with $100.  I'm confident that Bob will accept this offer. I'm willing to meet him halfway on this one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. His offers are getting too low, and it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. This guarantees me my minimum profit, and it's time to move on."
