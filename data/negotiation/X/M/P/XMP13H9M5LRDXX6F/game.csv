"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. Is that something you'd be interested in?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm still aiming to stay under $100, though. Would you be willing to do $110? That's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $115, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is already a compromise for me, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming to stay under $110.  How about we split the difference and do $112.50? That's a great price for both of us.",112.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $112.50. I'm willing to meet you at $118, but that's as low as I can go. This product is worth more than that to me, and I need to make a profit.",118.0,Alice,7,
