"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your company. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is the maximum I can afford for the product, considering my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a significant discount from my original offer.  This price reflects the value the product will bring to your business and gives us both a good outcome.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. This is the maximum I can stretch to, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers and come down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both come to an agreement.  I believe this is a good opportunity for both of us, let's see if we can make it work.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to be closer to my target of $1,000,000. I'm offering $975,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
