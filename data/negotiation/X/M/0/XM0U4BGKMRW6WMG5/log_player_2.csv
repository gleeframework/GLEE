"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $12,000. The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's perceived value of the product. This gives Alice some room to negotiate without feeling like she's being taken advantage of.  It's likely Alice will counter back, but Bob can then adjust his offer based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than he wants to pay. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  He's already gotten Alice to lower her price, showing there's still room for negotiation. Buying from John at $15,000 is still a worse option than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing that he's willing to pay a bit more than his initial offer, but still wants to stay below Alice's current price.  This shows a commitment to negotiation and suggests that Bob is serious about buying the product.  By offering $11,000, he leaves room for Alice to counter, but hopefully closes the gap further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high for Bob.  However, it's getting closer to his desired price, and the negotiation is showing some progress.  Since Bob still has a good chance of getting a better price, it's worth continuing the negotiation.  Buying from John at $15,000 is still a worse option than trying to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product. This counteroffer is still below Alice's current offer, but higher than his previous one, indicating a willingness to compromise.  It's likely that this offer will either be accepted or trigger a final counteroffer from Alice before Bob has to decide whether to buy from John or accept Alice's final price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still a bit higher than Bob wants to pay, but it's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.  At this point, it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in a few hundred dollar difference, and it's not worth risking the possibility that Alice will reject the offer and Bob will be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. 

Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial choice for Bob."
