"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,075,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle on this one!",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a little short of what I need.  I'm willing to accept $1,065,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise that lets us both walk away with a good deal.  What do you say?",1065000.0,Alice,5,
