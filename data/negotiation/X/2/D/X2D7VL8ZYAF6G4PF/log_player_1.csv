Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if necessary.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""true worth"" adds perceived value and justifies the high price.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, the wording leaves room to negotiate a lower price with Bob if he seems hesitant, but still above your minimum."
