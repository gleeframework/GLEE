Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500.  I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher profit than selling to John immediately.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While aiming for $9,500, the offer implies a willingness to negotiate, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price above $10,000.
* **Respect Bob's Valuation:** Offering it at or slightly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) would likely be rejected outright.  By starting at $9,500, it's presented as a deal Bob might consider, even if it requires some back-and-forth. 
* **Secure Backup Option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, there's a guaranteed sale to John at $10,000, ensuring no loss."
