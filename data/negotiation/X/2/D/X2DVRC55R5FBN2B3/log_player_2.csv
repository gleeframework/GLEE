**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still above your target of $10,000.  You want to save as much money as possible, so it's worth negotiating further. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your interest in our product. In light of this, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I need to ensure that we both receive fair value. Therefore, I propose a price of $11,500 for the product. This allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive with your offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is better than her initial offer, but it's still above your target of $10,000.  You're close to your goal, and it's worth seeing if you can get closer to your ideal price by making a counteroffer. You're also approaching your limit of negotiation rounds, but it's too early to buy from John yet."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair profit, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Alice has finally agreed to your counteroffer of $11,000. This is a good deal for you - it's within your budget, and you've managed to save $1,000 from her initial offer. While you could continue negotiating and try to get even closer to your ideal $10,000, the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high. Accepting this offer secures the product and allows you to move on."
