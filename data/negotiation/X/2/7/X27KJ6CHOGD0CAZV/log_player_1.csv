Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,000,000 is significantly more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $1,000,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,200,000). This gives him room to negotiate if he wants.

By starting with a high price, you create space for negotiation and hopefully get closer to your goal of maximizing your earnings. If Bob rejects, you can always adjust the price based on his response."
