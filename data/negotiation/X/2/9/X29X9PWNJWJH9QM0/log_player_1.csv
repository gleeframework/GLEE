Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and increases your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's ""unique value,"" subtly justifying the higher price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" could make Bob feel like he's getting a special deal.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can gradually lower your price, but never go below your minimum of $10,000."
