"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $600000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $700000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $700000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $650000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can get a great return on this investment.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not ready to give up on the value of this product just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession.
