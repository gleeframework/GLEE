# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750000. This is a great deal, considering the value it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the $1,000,000 maximum Bob is willing to pay. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go higher before resorting to John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $700000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $750,000 to $700,000, but Bob is still $100,000 above his counteroffer. There's room for further negotiation.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to compromise further before resorting to John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not ready to give up on the value of this product just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $675000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth. If you're still interested, I'm willing to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $675,000, which is only $25,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  This is a good deal for Bob considering he can get the product for significantly less than John's $1,000,000 price. It's worth accepting this offer to secure the product and potentially save a substantial amount of money."
