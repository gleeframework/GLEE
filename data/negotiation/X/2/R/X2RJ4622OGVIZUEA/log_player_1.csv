"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to me, at least $1,000,000, and I believe it will be even more valuable to you. To start, I'm willing to sell it for $1,150,000. This price allows for a comfortable margin for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While selling to John would be a safe option, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. The value of this product is significantly higher than that.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that takes your interests into account while still allowing me to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal. By rejecting his offer, I can continue negotiating and aim for a price closer to my desired range. Selling to John would guarantee me $1,000,000, but I see potential for a higher profit with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's work together to find a solution. I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Think about it, this is a product with significant potential, and this price ensures a profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of it, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiations, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price than what John is offering.  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is a secure and profitable outcome considering the limited rounds remaining."
