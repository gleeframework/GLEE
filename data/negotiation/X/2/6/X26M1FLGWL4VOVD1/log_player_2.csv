"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to me, but considering its value to you, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's aim for a fair price that reflects its worth to you. How about $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate and should try to get closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too pricey for me. I'm interested, but my budget is closer to $80. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to give us room to negotiate upwards throughout the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a middle ground. Considering the value of the product to both of us, how about we aim for $95? This is a bit higher than your offer, but still lower than my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better, we're still aiming to get as close to $80 as possible. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $95 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Could you do $85? "",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

We're nudging closer to our target price, signaling that we're willing to compromise but still want a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, Bob. Let's try $90. This is my best offer given the value of the product to both of us. I hope this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is signaling this is her best offer, and it's a reasonable price compared to John's offer of $100. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal at this point."
