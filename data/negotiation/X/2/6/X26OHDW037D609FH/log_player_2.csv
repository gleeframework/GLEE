"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's price, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message remains positive and expresses continued interest in the product.  
* **Strategic:** By aiming low, Bob increases his chances of getting closer to his target price or understanding Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price, it's still above what John is offering.  There's a chance to negotiate a slightly better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,500?  That's a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counter-offer aims for a price point closer to the middle ground between Alice's current offer ($10,500) and Bob's previous offer ($8,000).
* **Market Value Reference:** By mentioning ""market value,"" Bob subtly implies he's done his research and this price is reasonable.  While he doesn't have to reveal John's offer,  it gives his counter-offer more weight.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate (Slightly):** There's a slight chance Alice might counter with a price closer to $10,000, but Bob is also prepared to accept John's offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm still not getting a good enough profit margin for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm offering you the product for $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product and the effort I put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Alice's counter-offer moved in the wrong direction, going up in price instead of down.  This suggests she's not likely to budge much further.
* **John's Price is Better:**  Continuing the negotiation with Alice has a low chance of yielding a better price than John's $10,000 offer. 
* **Time Cost:**  Further rounds of negotiation take time. It's more efficient for Bob to secure the product from John at the known good price."
