"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm still not getting a good enough profit margin for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm offering you the product for $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product and the effort I put into it. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
