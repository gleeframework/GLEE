"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your desired price point of $800,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price. There are 9 rounds left, so you have time to try and find a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product at $800,000 for me. While I see the value, I'm currently looking to spend no more than $800,000.  I'm happy to start at $800,000 and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend $800000, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your desired price point of $800,000. While it is closer, you still have room to negotiate and see if you can get an even better price. With 7 rounds left, it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $875,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $837,500.  This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 837500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $837500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $800000. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your desired price point of $800,000. You've managed to negotiate a lower price, but you still have 5 rounds left to try and get closer to your target. It's worth trying to push for a lower price, especially since you have the option of buying from John for $800,000 if you don't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise.  While $850,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit out of my budget. Let's meet halfway one more time and try $825,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $825000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is already a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has consistently refused to go below $850,000, and with only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely she'll budge significantly further.
* **Value for money:**  John's offer of $800,000 is a guaranteed price that aligns with your budget.
* **Time constraint:** The pressure is building with fewer rounds remaining. It's time to secure the product rather than risking further negotiation. 

It's better to guarantee the product at your target price from John than risk further negotiation and potentially missing out on both deals."
