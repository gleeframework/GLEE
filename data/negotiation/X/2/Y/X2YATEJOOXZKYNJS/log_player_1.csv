"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. It's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $7,500, I'm not willing to sell it for less than $8,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $8,500. It's a compromise that's closer to my desired value and might be acceptable to Bob, especially since he's shown interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not willing to sell for less than $8,000. While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'll counteroffer again in hopes of finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8250} 
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $8,250. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, and hopefully, it'll be enough to convince Bob to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially getting an even worse price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $8,000. It's not ideal, but it's still a good deal, and I need to be realistic about the negotiation."
