"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its value, I'm asking for $13,500.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $12,250. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, and I want to make a deal happen.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,6,
