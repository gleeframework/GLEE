"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This feels like a good compromise for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,200. I think this product has a lot of value to offer, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $11,250? It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
