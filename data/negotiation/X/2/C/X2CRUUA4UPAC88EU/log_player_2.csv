"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $10,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $12,000. This counteroffer is still above Alice's value of $8,000, suggesting a potential area for negotiation. It's a reasonable starting point for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $11,500 is still lower than what Bob would pay John ($15,000). It's a good deal for Bob, and further negotiation might not result in a significantly lower price. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to maximize savings in this situation."
