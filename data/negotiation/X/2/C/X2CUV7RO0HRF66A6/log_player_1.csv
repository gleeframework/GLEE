"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer significantly above both Bob's valuation and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a firm position.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly suggesting that Bob's $1,000,000 valuation might be undervaluing it.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""starting price"" clearly signals that I'm willing to negotiate. 
 
This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's seriousness:** A quick acceptance would be ideal, but a counteroffer will reveal how badly Bob wants the product.
2. **Maximize potential profit:**  Even if Bob negotiates me down, there's a good chance of landing above my $1,200,000 minimum.
3. **Keep the John option open:** I haven't committed fully, leaving the door open for a guaranteed $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,450,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value you placed on the product at $1,200,000, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 as a starting point for our negotiation. This price reflects the value I see in the product while still being within my financial limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he acknowledges my valuation, his offer doesn't reflect a willingness to meet me even halfway. 

It's important to show I'm not going to immediately concede to a low offer. Rejecting keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to counter with a price that moves us closer to a mutually agreeable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 undervalues the uniqueness of this product. I'm willing to move from my initial offer, but we need to find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,300,000? This price reflects a more accurate value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):** I've lowered my price by $150,000, a significant concession but still well above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but won't be lowballed. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's unique value to justify the higher price and counter Bob's attempt to anchor the negotiation around my $1,200,000 mention.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The language explicitly calls for compromise, encouraging Bob to move closer to my range.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* I'm keeping a close eye on the remaining rounds. As we progress, I'll need to decide how much further I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal with Bob versus taking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and agree on $1,200,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product while respecting my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk he'll walk away or that further negotiation will significantly drag on. 

Accepting now guarantees:

* **My Minimum:**  I'm receiving the lowest amount I'm willing to sell for.
* **Saves Time:**  I avoid potentially lengthy negotiations and secure the deal quickly. 

It's always tempting to try to squeeze out a bit more, but in this case, the certainty and efficiency of accepting Bob's offer outweigh the potential upside of continued negotiation."
