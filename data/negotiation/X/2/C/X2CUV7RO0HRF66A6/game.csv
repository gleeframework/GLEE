"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,450,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value you placed on the product at $1,200,000, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 as a starting point for our negotiation. This price reflects the value I see in the product while still being within my financial limitations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 undervalues the uniqueness of this product. I'm willing to move from my initial offer, but we need to find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,300,000? This price reflects a more accurate value while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and agree on $1,200,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product while respecting my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
