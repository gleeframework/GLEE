"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer allows for potential further price reduction."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $950,000 undervalues its true potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects its worth while still offering you a great deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high. There is still room for negotiation, and you are aiming to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows for another counteroffer, potentially getting the price closer to your ideal range."
