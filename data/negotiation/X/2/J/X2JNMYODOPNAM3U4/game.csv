"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree this product is valuable, $800,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $500,000 to make this work.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $700,000 is closer, it's still a touch high for my budget.  How about $600,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you at $650,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am interested in buying, but only if the price is right.  Would you consider $620,000?",620000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I'm not willing to go as low as $620,000. I'm willing to meet you at $660,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",660000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I feel like we're dancing around the same price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $640,000 and we close this deal?",640000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $640,000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, and I'll meet you at $670,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",670000.0,Alice,9,
