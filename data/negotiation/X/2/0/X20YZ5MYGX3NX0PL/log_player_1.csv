Round 2
Bob's offer:

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** $1,000,000 is a significant profit margin above your minimum ($800,000).
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob stating this is his final offer adds weight and suggests he's unlikely to go higher. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Continuing could lead to a stalemate or risk Bob walking away altogether. 

While there's a theoretical chance of getting slightly more, accepting now secures a very favorable deal."
