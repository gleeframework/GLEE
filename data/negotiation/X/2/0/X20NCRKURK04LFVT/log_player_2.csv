"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $140 is better than $150 from John, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $140 is a bit high for me. How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $137.50? I think that's a fair price considering the value I think you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $137.50 is better than John's price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  Bob's initial offer of $130 was rejected, so he has room to make a slightly higher counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $137.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - $135. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think the product is worth more to you than $135. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $138? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting close to her minimum price:** This means further negotiation might be difficult, and Alice may become less flexible.
* **$138 is still a good deal for Bob:** It's significantly lower than John's price of $150 and within Bob's budget.
* **Time is a factor:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, there's a risk of running out of time and having to accept John's offer.

While Bob could try for a lower price, accepting Alice's offer ensures he gets a good deal and avoids the risk of losing out to John."
