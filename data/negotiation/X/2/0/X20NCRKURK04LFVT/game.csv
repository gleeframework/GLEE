,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $140 is a bit high for me. How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $137.50? I think that's a fair price considering the value I think you'll get from the product.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $137.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - $135. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think the product is worth more to you than $135. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $138?",138.0,Alice,5,
