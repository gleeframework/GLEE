"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  He has room to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that high.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1175000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what he can get from John. He should continue negotiating and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.

Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1150000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice to drop her price further. He has more rounds and leverage to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer again. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1125000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1145000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,145,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,145,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but Alice is still unwilling to drop below $1,145,000.  With only three rounds left, there's a high chance Bob won't be able to negotiate a price lower than that. Since he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, it's the safer and more financially beneficial decision to buy from John at this point.  There's no guarantee Bob will be able to get Alice to accept a lower offer in the remaining rounds."
