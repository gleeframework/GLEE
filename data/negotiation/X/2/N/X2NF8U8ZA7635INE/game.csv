"Bob, I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we're slowly getting closer.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
