"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Could you do it for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $15,000. This is my final offer."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  I could go up to $11,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more. It's still early in the negotiation, and there's room to try and secure a higher price than $11,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I'm motivated to sell, but I need to get at least $13,000 for it to make sense for me. How about we split the difference and call it $13,000?"", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  I appreciate you working with me. How about $11,500? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While we're still below our desired price, Bob has labeled this his ""final offer.""  Continuing to push might make him walk away entirely.  Accepting the $11,500 is better than risking no deal and getting $11,000 from John."
