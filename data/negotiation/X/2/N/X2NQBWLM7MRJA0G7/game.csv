"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Could you do it for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $15,000. This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  I could go up to $11,000. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I'm motivated to sell, but I need to get at least $13,000 for it to make sense for me. How about we split the difference and call it $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
