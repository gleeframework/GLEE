Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This leaves room for negotiation, as the product is worth $120 to Bob, but also ensures I earn more than my minimum of $80. I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is still higher than John's offer of $80 and it's close to my initial offer.  I'm willing to accept it and close the deal."
