"Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $550,000. This is a very competitive price for a product worth $800,000 to you, and I think it's a great opportunity to make a deal.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to go as low as $450,000. I'm counteroffering at $525,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement.",525000.0,Alice,5,
