"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $900,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and it's a great deal for you as well, considering it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested, but don't hesitate too long - I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
