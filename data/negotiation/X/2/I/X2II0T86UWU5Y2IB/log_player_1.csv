Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This is a strategic offer:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob sees the product as worth $8,000, so $9,000 is a good starting point.
* **It's lower than your backup price:** You can still make a profit ($1,000) if Bob rejects and you sell to John for $10,000.

This approach maximizes your chances of a sale with Bob while still protecting your minimum acceptable price."
