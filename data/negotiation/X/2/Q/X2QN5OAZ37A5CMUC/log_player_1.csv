Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $110. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves some room for negotiation. Bob might counteroffer, and I can still likely reach a price higher than John's offer ($80). 
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value without sounding desperate. 
 
This strategy aims to balance ambition with the flexibility to negotiate a deal that's beneficial for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to counteroffer at $95 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a reasonable profit, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's interested but trying to find a more appealing price point. I'm willing to negotiate further before settling or accepting John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is quite valuable to me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise.  It signals willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Justification:**  The message briefly reiterates the product's value without being overly pushy. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive and allows for further adjustments if Bob isn't satisfied. I'm still in a strong position to accept John's offer ($80) if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to counteroffer at $100 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $100 is a solid compromise. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price ($80) and provides a $20 profit. While I could try to push for slightly more, there's a risk Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit without jeopardizing the deal."
