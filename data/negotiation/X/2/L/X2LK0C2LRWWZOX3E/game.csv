"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your company. It's something that could significantly increase your efficiency and profitability. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000, a price that reflects its potential value and allows for a healthy margin for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",900000.0,Alice,1,
