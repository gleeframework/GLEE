"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if you can get closer to your $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer you $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're very close to your target price of $8,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. You've already shown you're willing to compromise, and Alice is now closer to your price.  Let's see if you can get her to budge a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $8,800 is still a little high for me.  Would you consider $8,600?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that point."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,700? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You're only $700 over your target price, and you've already had some successful negotiation.  At this point, it's probably worth accepting Alice's offer.  You can always try to negotiate for a lower price in the future if you need to, but it's unlikely you'll get a better deal."
