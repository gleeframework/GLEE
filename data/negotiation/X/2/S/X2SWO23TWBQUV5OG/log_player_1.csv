Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125."",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning you think it's worth $150, you anchor Bob's perception of value higher than his own. 
* **""Special Offer"" Framing:** Presenting it as a pre-listing offer creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can always negotiate down or sell to John for your minimum price."
