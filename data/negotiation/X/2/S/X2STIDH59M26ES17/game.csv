"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I agree your product is good, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However,  $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? ",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,125,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous negotiations. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
