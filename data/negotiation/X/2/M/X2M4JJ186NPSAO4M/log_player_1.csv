Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer ($950,000) anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) while staying significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial price gives space for Bob to counteroffer, allowing you to gauge his willingness to pay and potentially negotiate further.
* **Confident but Fair Tone:** The message aims to convey the product's value and your belief in a fair deal, encouraging Bob to engage positively.

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, you maximize your chances of securing a price closer to Bob's maximum willingness to pay. You also retain the option to accept John's offer ($800,000) if negotiations with Bob prove unsuccessful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both your asking price and your minimum acceptable price. It's clear he's trying to negotiate a bargain, but accepting this offer would leave a substantial amount of money on the table.  You know John will buy the product for $800,000, making Bob's current offer unacceptable. 

By rejecting and entering the next round of negotiation, you can:

* **Signal your position:** Show Bob that his offer is too low and you're willing to walk away. 
* **Potentially reach a compromise:** There's still room for negotiation between his offer and your initial asking price.

You'll need to counter with a price that balances firmness with a willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential.  To find a mutually agreeable solution, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:**  While you're rejecting his lowball offer, you're demonstrating flexibility by decreasing your asking price by $50,000.
* **Justifying the Price:** You're reiterating the product's value, reinforcing that your price is based on its worth, not arbitrary.
* **Compromise but Not Capitulation:**  This counteroffer keeps the price well above your minimum ($800,000) while still leaving some room for further negotiation with Bob if needed. 

This strategy aims to guide the negotiation towards a favorable outcome while remaining prepared to walk away if necessary and accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and now sits comfortably above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000). While you could potentially try to negotiate for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. 

Here's why accepting is a good strategy:

* **Strong Profit:** You're securing a profit of $50,000 above your minimum, which is a good return. 
* **Limited Upside in Further Negotiation:**  It's unlikely you'll get much higher than $850,000 from Bob, and pushing him too hard could backfire.
* **Certainty and Efficiency:** Accepting now guarantees the sale and avoids the potential time and effort of further negotiation.

Overall, $850,000 is a favorable outcome, and the potential risks of continued negotiation outweigh the possible rewards."
