**Reasoning:**

Bob's offers are consistently decreasing and moving further away from your minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's beneficial for you.  John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is already above Bob's current offer and your minimum. It makes more financial sense to cut your losses and sell to John."
