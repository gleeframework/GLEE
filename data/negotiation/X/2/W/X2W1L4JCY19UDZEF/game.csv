"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would be a more reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value while staying within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
