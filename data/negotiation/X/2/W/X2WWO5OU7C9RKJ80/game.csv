"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $11,000.",11000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $16,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business."
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $13,500. I'm confident that this is a price that we can both agree on.",13500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. While $13,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",12000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $14,500. It's a bit higher than your target, but I think it's a reasonable compromise."
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm getting close to my target, but I'd like to make one more push. I can offer you $13,750 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price.",13750.0,Alice,5,,
