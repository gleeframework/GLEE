Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $13,500. I'm confident that this is a price that we can both agree on.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm getting close to my target, but I'd like to make one more push. I can offer you $13,750 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $13,750, and she's indicated it's her final offer.  To ensure you stay within your $10,000 budget, it's time to cut negotiations and buy from John."
