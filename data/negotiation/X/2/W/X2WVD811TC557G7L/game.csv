"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,050,000. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not quite there with $975,000. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I think $1,025,000 is a fair price for this product. It's still a great value, and I believe you'll be happy with the purchase. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,020,000? It's a bit above your latest offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,7,
