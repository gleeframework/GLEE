Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You won't lose money if Bob rejects the offer. 
* **It's significantly lower than Bob's value:** This gives Bob a strong incentive to accept the offer and get a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob wants to negotiate, you can potentially reach a price closer to $15,000."
