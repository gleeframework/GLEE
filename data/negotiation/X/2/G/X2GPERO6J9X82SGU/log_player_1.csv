Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **John as Backup:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John. 

Therefore, setting the price at $14,500 creates a strong incentive for Bob:

* **Potential Gain:** Bob could potentially resell later for a profit if he chooses.
* **Significant Discount:**  It's a substantial discount from what I'd get from John.

By starting high, but leaving room for negotiation, there's a chance Bob might accept the offer, netting a higher profit than the guaranteed $15,000."
