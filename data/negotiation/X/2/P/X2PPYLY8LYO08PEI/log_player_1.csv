"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a higher price from Bob.  I'll counter his offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which still leaves some room for us both to be happy. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,350,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

While $1,350,000 is a good price, I'm still not completely satisfied. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a deal closer to my initial price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value our ongoing negotiation, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This offer is fair and ensures a successful outcome for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1375000}

I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'm not yet ready to sell to John. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continuous efforts to find a solution, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low. However, I'm determined to close this deal.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to compromise again, so I'm offering $1,320,000. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiations and I've been unable to get Bob to budge much further. While $1,320,000 is a decent price, I don't think I'll be able to get any closer to my target. It's better to secure the sale with John at $1,200,000 than risk losing the deal entirely and having to wait for another buyer."
