Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $10,000 to him.
* **Your Guarantee:**  You have John as a backup buyer at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You have a strong position. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you should aim for a price closer to your minimum, leaving little room for Bob to negotiate.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm pricing it at $11,500. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline, e.g., the end of the day tomorrow], after which I'll be moving forward with another interested party."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're not starting with a negotiation. You're presenting a limited-time opportunity.
* **Justification:** You vaguely mention ""unique value,"" which could refer to its value to Bob or its value in a broader market.
* **Deadline:** Creates urgency and limits Bob's time to counter-offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Subtly reminds Bob that he's not your only option.

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is important, you might adjust the price slightly lower. However, remember, you have a strong position.
* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might need to factor that in and adjust your strategy.
