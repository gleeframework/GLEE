"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $82. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your understanding, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $80, which is the price I'm willing to pay for the product. If you're not willing to sell it to me for that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying it from John for the same price.",80.0,Bob,6,
