Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $9,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering my valuation and allows for a profitable sale.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
