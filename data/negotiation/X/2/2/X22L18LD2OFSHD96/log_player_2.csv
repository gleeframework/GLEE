"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an item valued at $8,000 by you, while also providing me with a fair return. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $9,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering my valuation and allows for a profitable sale.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
