"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the value, but $22,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. To be frank, $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $14,000? That's a significant offer on my end.",14000.0,Bob,4,
