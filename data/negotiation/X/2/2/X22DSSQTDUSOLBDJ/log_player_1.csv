Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $80, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. What would you say to a price of $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always a good strategy to start negotiations higher than your minimum price. This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By suggesting Bob offers a price, it opens the door for him to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than $80.
* **Anchoring:** By mentioning $80 as the minimum worth, I'm trying to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value closer to my desired selling price.

Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, I can still negotiate down towards $80 or sell it to John for my minimum price."
