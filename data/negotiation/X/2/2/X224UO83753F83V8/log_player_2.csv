"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm looking for $12000 for it. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $12,000, and Alice is offering the product at your limit, there's no immediate incentive to accept.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by 20%. This is a reasonable starting point, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but also pushing for a better price. I'm hoping she'll counter with a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I can offer you a compromise at $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my target.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and do $10,500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to push for a lower price but am moving closer to Alice's offer.  This shows flexibility and commitment while still working towards my goal. The compromise language aims to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10500. I can offer you a slight reduction to $11200, which is still a good deal for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now at $11,200. This is a significant reduction from her initial offer, and while I'd prefer a lower price, it's getting close to my limit. Continuing to negotiate might save a few hundred dollars, but it's risky.  There's a good chance she'll hold firm, and I risk losing the deal altogether. 

Considering the time constraint and the possibility of losing the deal, accepting her offer is the most logical choice. It's within my budget, and I've still achieved a decent discount."
