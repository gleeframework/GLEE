"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I can offer you a compromise at $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $11000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and do $10500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10500. I can offer you a slight reduction to $11200, which is still a good deal for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",11200.0,Alice,5,
