"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is well above Bob's budget. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I see the value of this product,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while also being a fair starting point for further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, and I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise and still reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's counteroffer is a step down from her initial price, it's still too high for Bob's budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price, aiming to get closer to his target of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $950,000.  This price demonstrates my serious intent to buy and offers a fair middle ground for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. I believe this price is a reasonable compromise and reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. Even though she's coming down in price, Bob is still far from his target of $800,000.  He needs to continue negotiating to try to get a better deal.  If he doesn't get closer to his budget, buying from John might be the more sensible option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a significant gap from my budget. To demonstrate my commitment to acquiring this product, I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I sincerely hope you can see this as a viable option for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that $975,000 is sufficient to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product and be willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's final offer is still significantly higher than Bob's target price of $800,000.  It's becoming increasingly clear that they won't be able to reach an agreement within Bob's budget. Given the limited rounds remaining and the risk of further negotiation delays, it's more prudent for Bob to buy the product from John at a price he can afford."
