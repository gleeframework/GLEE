"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is still below its value to me, but it also offers a higher profit margin for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
