"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price reflects the true worth of the product while still allowing you a considerable profit margin.",900000.0,Alice,3,
