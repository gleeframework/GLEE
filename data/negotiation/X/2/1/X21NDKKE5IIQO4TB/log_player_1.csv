Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price reflects the true worth of the product while still allowing you a considerable profit margin."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'm proposing $875,000. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

While I could push for more, Bob has indicated this is his final offer. Accepting $875,000 is a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away, leaving me with John's lower offer."
