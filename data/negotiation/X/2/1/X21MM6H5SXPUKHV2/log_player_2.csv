"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $90 is a good deal, it's worth seeing if you can get it lower.  There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate, so you have plenty of time to try and find a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $90 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $75.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $82.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $82.50 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still a bit above my ideal price point of $75.  I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target.  There are still 7 rounds left, so I have time to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $80.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $85. I think this product is worth it, and I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about we meet at $84? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $84
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $84 is getting closer to my ideal price point of $75, and I'm running out of time.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or I might end up having to buy from John at $120.  Accepting Alice's offer at $84 is a good compromise, as it saves me $36 compared to John's price."
