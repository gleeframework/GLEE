"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a unique opportunity with significant value, and I believe it would be a great asset for you. My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let's discuss!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your product's value, but $1,100,000 is still out of my range. Let's try $950,000. It's a significant step closer to my budget, and hopefully, we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer, I can't go that low. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
