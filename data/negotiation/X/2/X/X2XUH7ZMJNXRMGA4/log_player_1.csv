"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming to maximize my profit.  Bob knows the product is worth $8,000 to him, so he'll likely counteroffer. I'll be ready to negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is closer to my goal, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I believe I can get closer to $10,000 with a counteroffer, and if that fails, I can always fall back on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500.  This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my goal.  If he rejects, I'll re-evaluate my position and potentially move closer to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm feeling the pressure, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm willing to risk another round with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired $10,000.  If this fails, I'll move to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering my alternative is to sell to John for the same price. If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's time to cut my losses. Bob is clearly not willing to budge on his price, and I've already rejected two of his offers. I can't risk losing any more rounds, so I'm going to sell to John for $10,000."
