,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet the price of $15,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $9,500? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price considering its value.",9500.0,Bob,4,
