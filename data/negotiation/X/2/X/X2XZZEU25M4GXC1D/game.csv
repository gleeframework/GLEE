"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our interests.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
