"I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875000. I believe this price is a fair compromise and reflects the value of the product. What are your thoughts?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than $875000. I'm willing to pay $825000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $860000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What are your thoughts?",860000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still a bit far from it. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll offer $835000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",835000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but I'm still not convinced that $835000 is enough. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $855000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's the best price we can both agree on. What are your thoughts?",855000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, but I'm still not comfortable with $855000. I'm willing to go up to $830000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can agree on this price.",830000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one last attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go below $845000. I'm counteroffering at $845000. If you're still not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider other options.
