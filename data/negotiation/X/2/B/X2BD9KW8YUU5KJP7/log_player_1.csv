Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and it gives Bob room to negotiate. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would ideally get closer to my initial goal, $920,000 is a good price and represents a significant profit. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer and forcing me to sell to John for $800,000, which is less desirable."
