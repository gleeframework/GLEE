{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit. This price also incentivizes Bob to accept, as he saves $1,000 compared to his own valuation.
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of selling to John for $12,000 if Bob rejects the offer."
