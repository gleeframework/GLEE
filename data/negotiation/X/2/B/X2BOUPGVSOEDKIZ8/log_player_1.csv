Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common strategy in negotiation to leave room for compromise.  Since I have a backup offer from John for $100, I can afford to be a bit aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I have a backup offer from John, so I can afford to be patient and try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation and I'm starting to feel like this is taking too long.  I'm happy to take the guaranteed $100 from John, rather than risk another round of negotiations with Bob that might result in a lower offer."
