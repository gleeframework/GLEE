"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think it's a good compromise.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a little out of my reach. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,200. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great compromise considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your firm stance, but $9,200 is still a bit above my budget. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to pay $9,100. This is a very fair price considering the value to me, and it gets us very close to a deal. I'm hoping we can find common ground and close this out.",9100.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,150. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to prioritize my own interests. Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",9150.0,Alice,7,
