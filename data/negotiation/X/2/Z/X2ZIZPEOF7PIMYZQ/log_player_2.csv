"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  This is a great deal for you, as you've mentioned its value is $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be selling it to another buyer for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you stand to save $2,000 and still acquire the product."
