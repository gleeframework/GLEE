"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your life.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product will bring to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit much. How about $10,000? That's my absolute best offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your absolute best offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",11000.0,Alice,5,
