"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This initial offer is a strong starting point. It's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also conveys confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  That's a fair price that still allows you to profit from this purchase."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
