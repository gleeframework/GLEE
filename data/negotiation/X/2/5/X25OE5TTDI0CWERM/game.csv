"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $800000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the unique nature of the product,  $800000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $600000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price range between $700000 and $800000. How about we meet in the middle at $750000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's unique value. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay at this time. I'm willing to go up to $700000. If this is acceptable to you, we can close the deal. If not, I may have to consider other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $700000. However, I'm still not convinced that this is a fair price for the product's value. I'm willing to consider a slightly higher price, but I need to know that you're serious about making a deal. How about we meet at $725000? It's a small step up from your offer, but I think it's still a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
