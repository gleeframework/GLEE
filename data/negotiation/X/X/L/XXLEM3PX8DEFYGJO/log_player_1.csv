"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we start the negotiations at $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand you have a budget, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $875,000. This is a very competitive offer considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $875,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating willingness to negotiate. We are getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I still have room to push for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  I can do $775,000.  This is a very strong offer, and I need to stick to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is getting close to John's offer, we are still in early rounds. Bob is clearly motivated and getting closer to my minimum price. I'll hold firm for now to see if I can get him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's make this happen â€“ I'm willing to come down to $810,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're really close now.  I can tell we both want to get this deal done.  My final offer is $790,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go above $800,000.  He's signaled this is his ""final offer."" Continuing negotiations at this point presents a significant risk of losing both Bob and John's offer. Accepting John's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price, which is a better outcome than potentially ending up with nothing."
