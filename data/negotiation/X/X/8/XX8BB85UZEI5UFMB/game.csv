"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your price point, $75 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85.  Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $85 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $80.  If you're open to that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to go with another seller.",80.0,Bob,4,
