Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

This offer aims to maximize potential profit while still considering the possibility of Bob rejecting it. Here's why:

* **Above Minimum:**  The offer is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, giving you a profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Not Too High:** $9,000 is a relatively modest markup. If Bob values the product significantly higher, he may be willing to pay it. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $8,000 acts as a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you're guaranteed to make at least your minimum price."
