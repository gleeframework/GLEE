,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product.  Let's make this happen.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay the full $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $775,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we settle on $790,000? This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your final decision.",790000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to accepting, Alice, but $790,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $780,000. Can you meet me at this price?",780000.0,Bob,6,
