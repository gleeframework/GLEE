Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob's business to make the price seem more justified.
* **Open to negotiation:** I invite Bob to share his thoughts, signaling my willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

* This starting point gives me leverage while keeping the door open for a deal. 
* If Bob rejects, I can assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet. There's still room for negotiation with Bob. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point.

**Next steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still offers you a significant return on your investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial bid. 
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob about the value the product brings to his business to justify the price.
* **Keep negotiating:**  I'm open to further discussion to reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer shows flexibility while still staying within my desired range. 
* It keeps the negotiation going, increasing the likelihood of a successful deal with Bob before I have to turn to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,000,000 even? That's my absolute best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum acceptable price.  It's still a significant profit for me.
* **Risk of losing out:**  If I reject, there's no guarantee that Bob will offer more in the next round. I risk ending up with nothing if he walks away.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** I can still sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not in a desperate situation.

**Strategy:**

This is a good compromise that secures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing the deal completely. While I would prefer more, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this stage."
