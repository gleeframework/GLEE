Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,250,000 is far beyond my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Explanation:

Bob has been very firm at $1,300,000 and hasn't budged significantly in his offers. It's unlikely he'll suddenly agree to a price closer to my valuation.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
