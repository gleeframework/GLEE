"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,500,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has value, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
