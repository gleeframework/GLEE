Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,500,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has value, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000.
