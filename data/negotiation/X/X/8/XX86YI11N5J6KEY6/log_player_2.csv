"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,500,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice has shown she's not willing to budge much from her last offer.  You're better off taking the guaranteed price from John at $1,000,000 than risking further negotiation with Alice."
