"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. I believe this price reflects the value you'll derive from owning this product, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Alice's offer of $900,000 is $100,000 less than John's price.
* **It's still within your budget.** You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice's offer is below that. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you money compared to buying from John."
