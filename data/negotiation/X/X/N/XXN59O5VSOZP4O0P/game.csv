"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'd like to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'm willing to include a 5-year warranty and a dedicated support package. I'm still firm at $1050000, but I think these extras make it a more compelling offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to compromise on the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1025000, but I'm not including any extras this time. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800000, and I'm already giving you a significant discount.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $1025000. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1025000, and I'm throwing in a 3-year maintenance package to sweeten the deal. This is my last offer, and I expect you to accept it.",1025000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your final offer and the additional maintenance package. I appreciate the effort. However, I must respectfully decline the offer at $1025000. I am unable to move beyond my maximum budget of $1000000. I will proceed to purchase the product from John for $800000.",800000.0,Bob,10,
