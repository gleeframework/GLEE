{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $12,000. It's a great deal, and you know it's worth a lot to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It's important to note that this is just one strategy and there are many factors to consider when setting a price, such as:

* **How much does Bob need the product?** If he really wants it, he might be willing to pay closer to my minimum.
* **How likely is it that John will buy the product?** If I'm confident John will buy it, I can be bolder with my offer to Bob.

Ultimately, the best price to offer Bob will depend on the specific situation and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
