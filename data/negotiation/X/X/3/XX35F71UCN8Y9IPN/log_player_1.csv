"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get as close to my desired price as possible. I'm aware that Bob values the product at $800,000, so I'm leaving room for negotiation but not giving away too much value upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm going to try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but still keep it above my minimum value.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can push for a better price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,000,000.  I'm going to try to get closer to that price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but still keeping it above Bob's last offer. With each round, I'm getting closer to his perceived value while also making sure I'm not giving away too much. I'm confident that Bob will eventually accept an offer somewhere between our current positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $975,000 is very close to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. I'm aware that Bob is pushing the limits of his value and we are close to a deal. However, I'm going to try to push for a better price in the next round to see if there's any room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm making a smaller counteroffer this time, only $25,000 lower than my last offer. This shows that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value. I believe this small adjustment might be enough to entice Bob into accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $990,000 is very close to my minimum value, I'm still holding out for a slightly better price. We're only $10,000 apart, and with just a couple of rounds left, I'm confident I can push for that final bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm confident that Bob will accept it, as it's very close to his last offer and just slightly above my minimum value. If he rejects it, I'll sell to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I meet my minimum requirement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $998,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $998,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm disappointed that we couldn't reach an agreement with Bob, I'm ultimately satisfied with selling to John.  Even though it's only a small difference, I'm able to reach my minimum desired value and it's important to me to stand by my initial goal."
