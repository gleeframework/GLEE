{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, it encourages him to counter-offer and allows for potential bargaining.  It also sets a baseline that is higher than John's offer, ensuring that if Bob doesn't counter, I can still walk away with a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I want to maximize my profit, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $8,500? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for countering. I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, my budget is really pushing it at that point.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly higher price."
