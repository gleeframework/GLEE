"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, but I'm open to discussing it further.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. ",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for us. How about we split the difference again and settle on $9,750? This is my final offer.",9750.0,Alice,5,
