"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000.  He should proceed with a counteroffer to Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, but I'm open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay and higher than what he can get from John.  Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice, trying to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for us. How about we split the difference again and settle on $9,750? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $9,750 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's time to move on and get a better deal from John."
