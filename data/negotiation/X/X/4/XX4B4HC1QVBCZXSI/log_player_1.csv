**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is consistently moving upwards and we are now at $1,080,000. This is a solid profit above our minimum and there's a risk Bob will disengage if we push further. It's better to secure the deal now at a good price than risk losing him and settling for John's lower offer."
