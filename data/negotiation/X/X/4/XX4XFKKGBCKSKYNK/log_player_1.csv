Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product!  It's a real game-changer, and I believe it could be extremely valuable for your business. I'm open to negotiation, but my starting price is $1,200,000.  Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I need to keep my costs down. Would you consider lowering the price to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives you a significant saving over your initial valuation, and it allows me to meet my minimum price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I think $1,000,000 would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,000,000 is a good deal for both of us. It's well above my minimum acceptable price and gives me a decent profit.  It's also getting late in the negotiations, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
