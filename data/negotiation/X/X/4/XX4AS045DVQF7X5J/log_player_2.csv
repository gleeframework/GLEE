You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than John's price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you create an opportunity for Alice to potentially lower her price further."
