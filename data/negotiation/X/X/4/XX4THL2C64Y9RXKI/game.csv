"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1300000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1150000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1150000 is too far below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1250000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit too high. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is my final offer, as I am prepared to buy from John at that price if necessary.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
