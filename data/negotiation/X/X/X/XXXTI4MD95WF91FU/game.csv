"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about we bring the price down a bit?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $650,000 is a significant reduction from the original offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm not giving away too much value. I'm counteroffering at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering my costs and the product's value to me.",800000.0,Alice,3,
