Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product which I believe would be valuable for you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's valuation is $8,000, Alice doesn't know if there's room to negotiate upwards. Starting with a price closer to her own valuation leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Bob to Counter:** The $11,000 offer gives Bob the opportunity to counter-offer if he's truly interested. This allows Alice to gauge Bob's interest level and potentially reach a price higher than $8,000.
* **Safety Net of John:** Alice is secure knowing John will purchase the product for $12,000 if Bob declines. This allows her to confidently aim for a higher price with Bob. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation."
