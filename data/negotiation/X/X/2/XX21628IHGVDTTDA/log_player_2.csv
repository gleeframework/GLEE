"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is closer to his target than Alice's initial value, it's still above his limit.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price.  He can either counteroffer Alice or buy from John, but going with a counteroffer gives him more control over the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his $8,000 limit as possible while still leaving room for Alice to negotiate. A $9,000 offer is a significant drop from Alice's $11,000 offer, showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal. This counteroffer leaves $1,000 on the table for Alice, giving her a potential profit and making her more likely to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but $10,000 is still above his $8,000 limit.  Bob can still try to negotiate a better price.  He might risk losing the deal, but given his goal of saving as much money as possible, it's worth pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's moved up from his previous offer, showing some willingness to compromise. $9,500 is still a good deal for him, and it's closer to Alice's offer of $10,000.  This suggests that he's serious about buying the product and that he's willing to meet halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's goal, but it's still $2,500 above his limit. There are only 5 rounds left, and Bob can still try to push for a lower price.  He should continue to negotiate to see if he can get a better deal. While he could buy from John now, he may miss the chance to get a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price but is also recognizing that time is running out. He's offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. $9,750 is still a good deal for him, and it leaves a small margin for Alice to make a profit.  This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product and wants to close the deal, but he's not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 3 rounds left, the negotiations aren't progressing quickly enough. Alice is coming down in price, but not at a pace that allows Bob to reach his goal. He's only $250 away from reaching his maximum, but the risk of not reaching an agreement in the limited remaining rounds is too high. Buying from John guarantees Bob the product for his maximum price, allowing him to secure the purchase without further delays or risks."
