"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit higher than my budget. How about $9500? I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $11000?  I'm still confident that this is a great deal for you, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still above my limit. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
