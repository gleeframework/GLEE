"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I can go up to $700,000 if we can close the deal today.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the product's real worth, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
