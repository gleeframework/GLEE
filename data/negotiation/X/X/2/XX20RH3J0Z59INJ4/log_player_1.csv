"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I am only able to offer $16,000 for it. I hope this is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation. Selling to John would give me a guaranteed $15,000, but there's a chance I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $16,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $16,500 is getting closer to my ideal price.  I'm only $500 away from my initial target of $17,000 and it's getting late in the negotiation.  I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob completely and having to settle with John's offer of $15,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer and secure the sale."
