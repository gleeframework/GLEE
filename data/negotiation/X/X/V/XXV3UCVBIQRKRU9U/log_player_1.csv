Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $120. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $150, so starting at $120 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer positions the price closer to Bob's perceived value than your minimum. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum.

**Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters."
