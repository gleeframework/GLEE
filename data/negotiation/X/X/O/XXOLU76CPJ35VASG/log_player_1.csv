{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [briefly describe the product] that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested! "", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $15,000 is a significant amount, but it allows room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Mentioning the product's value is a subtle way to gauge Bob's interest without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Open-Ended:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing the negotiation to progress. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Product's Actual Value:** While $10,000 is your minimum,  consider the product's true market value to set a realistic starting point.
* **Bob's Financial Situation:** If you have any insight into Bob's resources, adjust your offer accordingly. 
* **Negotiation Style:**  Are you willing to haggle a lot, or are you looking for a quick deal? Adjust your initial offer and strategy based on your preference."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:**  $10,000 is your minimum, but Bob's offer is at the very bottom of your acceptable range. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** You've already established a higher initial price, making it more likely that you can get a better deal through negotiation. 
* **Further Information:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to gather more information about his motivations and budget, helping you make a more informed counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**  You will need to make a counteroffer to Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm still willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I believe that's a fair price for the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  A counteroffer of $12,500 is a compromise, showing flexibility while staying above your minimum. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Reiterating the product's value helps reinforce the justification for the price.
* **Open-Ended:**  The message invites Bob to make a further counteroffer, keeping the negotiation fluid.

**Important Consideration:**

* **Bob's Response:**  Observe Bob's reaction to your counteroffer. Is he willing to negotiate further, or does he seem firm in his initial price? Adjust your strategy accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $11500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is only $1,500 below your initial asking price and just $500 above your minimum. This is a good deal for you considering the possibility that Bob might walk away.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While accepting his offer means ending the negotiation, you could always suggest a future deal or partnership with Bob that might be mutually beneficial, keeping the door open for future business. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take additional time and effort. Accepting Bob's offer allows you to secure the sale and move on to other opportunities.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Your Negotiation Style:** Are you comfortable with a slightly lower price or are you more determined to get closer to your initial asking price?
* **Bob's Future Business:** If you believe Bob could be a valuable future client, consider accepting his offer to build a relationship."
