"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $12,000, which is Bob's maximum budget, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $12,500."
