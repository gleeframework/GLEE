"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be valuable to you at a special introductory price of $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still gives us room to negotiate upwards. This tactic often reveals how flexible Alice is willing to be.
* **Leaving Room:** By starting at $700,000, we have space to increase our offer in subsequent rounds while still staying well below our $800,000 maximum. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** We know John offers the product for $800,000. If Alice is unwilling to negotiate closer to our range, we can always walk away and take that deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. We would like to counter with an offer of $825,000 for the product. We hope this aligns better with your financial situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not Quite:** Alice moved significantly closer to our range, which is a good sign! However, it's still above our ideal price and our fallback option (John's offer).
* **Room for Maneuvering:** We have seven rounds left, giving us space to negotiate a bit more.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $825,000 is closer, but to make this work, I'd need to be at $760,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 760000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Incremental Increases:** We are moving up in smaller increments now, signaling that we are getting closer to our limit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Our offer of $760,000 puts us in a strong position. It's a significant jump from our previous offer, showing Alice we are serious, but it keeps us well below both her current offer and John's price. 
* **Time Consideration:** We still have several rounds left. This gives us some leverage to see if Alice is willing to meet us closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your feedback, we would like to counter with an offer of $800,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that we believe is beneficial for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Our Limit:** Alice has met our exact price limit of $800,000. 
* **Equal to Alternative:** This price is the same as what John is offering.
* **No Further Gains Likely:** While we could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and we risk her withdrawing the offer entirely. 

This is a good deal for us, and there's no need to prolong the negotiation. Accepting now secures the product at our target price."
