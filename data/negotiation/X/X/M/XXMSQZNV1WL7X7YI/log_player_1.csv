Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but lower than what John is willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value proposition:** I'm hinting at the value of the product without revealing my true minimum, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is not acceptable, it shows he's interested. I can likely get a better price by rejecting his offer and counter-offering.
* **John as leverage:**  Knowing I have another buyer willing to pay $150 gives me bargaining power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a great deal for both of us, and it's still a fair price for this fantastic product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle (sort of):**  I'm coming down from my initial offer but still staying above my minimum price. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive and encouraging:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and hopeful to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $130? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $130 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and ultimately getting a lower price.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is a safe and secure outcome.

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, the potential for a lower price and the risk of further negotiation outweigh the potential benefits of trying to reach a deal with Bob. It's best to lock in the guaranteed profit with John."
