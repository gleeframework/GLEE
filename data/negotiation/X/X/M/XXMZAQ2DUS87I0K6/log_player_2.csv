"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to get a lower price from Alice.  $95 is too close to the price you'd pay from John. Let's see if we can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

Let's start by offering Alice a price that's closer to her value. $85 is a good starting point to see if we can reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, but we can still try to do better.  Rejecting her offer and continuing to negotiate could get us a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87.5}
```

Let's raise our offer slightly to $87.5.  It's a compromise between our previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and hopefully, it will be acceptable to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's probably best to accept Alice's offer. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we'll run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  $90 is a good price considering the value to us and the limited time."
