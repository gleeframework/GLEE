{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm sure you'll love it. I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you are confident in your product's value.  I'm aiming for a good deal, but also want to be open to negotiating further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a slightly better price.  There's still some room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle for too low a price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $135. This way, you get a great deal, and I can still make a decent profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and it's clear that we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  At this point, it's better for me to cut my losses and sell to John.  John's offer guarantees me a good profit, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiations with Bob."
