"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $140 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer.  $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  I think this price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal. Let me know what you think!",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $135 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  I think that's a fair compromise.",130.0,Bob,4,
