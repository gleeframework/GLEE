Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. However, I'm open to discussing a figure that feels right for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with the product's full value to you ($1,000,000) sets a high anchor. While Bob might not accept this price, it creates a perception of high value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions willingness to negotiate, showing Bob that you're flexible and potentially incentivizing him to counter-offer within a range closer to your desired outcome.
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims to maximize profit but carries the slight risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. 
* Observing Bob's reaction to this initial offer will be key. If he seems completely turned off, you can adjust your approach in a follow-up."
