"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.  If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,000,000.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
