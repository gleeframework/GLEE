{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but still below your minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation and potentially finding a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'd like to sell the product, $90 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to a compromise. How about $105? That would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $97.50 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a bit closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and settle on $101.25?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 101.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not sure about $101.25. I'm willing to go up to $100, which is the price I was originally offered by John. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $100 is close to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  Since John is willing to pay $120, I'm going to go ahead and sell the product to him. It's a better deal for me, and I don't want to risk continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price."
