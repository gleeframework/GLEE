{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to me, but below what I could get from John. This gives me some room to negotiate, and it also shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below what the product is worth to me, and I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $150? That's still a good price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm offering $150, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept it, but if not, I can still sell the product to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $135. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below what the product is worth to me.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with him at this price point.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150, which is the minimum I'm comfortable with."
