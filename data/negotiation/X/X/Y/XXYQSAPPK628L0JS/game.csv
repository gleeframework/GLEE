,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $145? I think that's a fair price for a product in good condition like yours.",145.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate you being interested. $145 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $160?  It's still a great deal for a product in this condition.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $160 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to meet me at $155? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal with you.",155.0,Bob,4,
