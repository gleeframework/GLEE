{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** $12,000 is a significant discount from my minimum value ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the value Bob will get and frame it as a ""great deal"" to entice him.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I end with a question, encouraging Bob to respond and keeping the dialogue open. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible price while also maintaining a good relationship with Bob in case negotiations continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That's a bit too high for my budget right now. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $5,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000 and even lower than the value to Bob ($8,000). Accepting this offer would be a huge loss. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, it's still worth continuing negotiations. There's a chance we can find a price that's more favorable for both of us. 
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed outcome:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I want to explore all options before resorting to that. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, I keep the negotiation alive and have a chance to reach a better price than what Bob offered."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is just too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $9,000? That's still a great price for a product worth much more to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering $9,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $5,000. 
* **Reiterate Value:** I remind Bob that the product is worth more to him, emphasizing the value he'd get at this price.
* **Open-ended Question:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the dialogue.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions while maintaining a positive tone and keeping negotiations open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?  That's closer to what I had in mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer of $7,000 is a step up from his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I believe there's still room to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Avoiding a loss:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees my desired profit, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, I maintain control of the negotiation and have a chance to get a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering $10,000, a compromise between my previous offer of $9,000 and Bob's offer of $7,000.
* **Reiterate Value:** I emphasize the value Bob will get from the product to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I use positive language like ""fair price"" and ""make this deal happen"" to encourage a positive outcome.

This counteroffer aims to push the price closer to my minimum value while still remaining reasonable and showing a willingness to reach an agreement."
