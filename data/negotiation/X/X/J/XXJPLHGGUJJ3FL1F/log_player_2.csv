Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, I'm still looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is below Alice's asking price, but above her minimum acceptable price.** This shows a willingness to negotiate, but also demonstrates that you're serious about getting a good deal.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $1,350,000.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,300,000.  This would be a great compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```
