"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to the midpoint of our values ($100 is closer to $120 than $80). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good deal.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and open tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm hinting at the value of the product without explicitly stating Bob's value, to avoid giving away too much information. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation on a positive note and get Bob thinking about the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's still interested. This gives me an opportunity to counter and try to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John is a Safety Net:**  I know I can sell to John for $80, so I'm not under pressure to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and keep the negotiation moving forward with the hope of reaching a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not by much. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to maintain a good relationship with Bob.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  I'm emphasizing the idea of finding a ""compromise"" to encourage Bob to meet me halfway. 

This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. 
* **Time Factor:** We're already in round 4, so there's a chance that we may not reach an agreement if we keep negotiating. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a price that's above my minimum and closes the deal without the risk of further negotiation."
