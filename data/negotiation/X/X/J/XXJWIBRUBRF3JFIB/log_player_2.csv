"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exceptional opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This item holds immense value for us at $1,200,000, but considering its potential impact on your endeavors, we believe it's worth every penny. We are offering this remarkable asset to you at a special introductory price of $950,000. This is a strategic move to ensure both parties benefit from this transaction. Please let us know if you would like to proceed with this exclusive offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is lower than John's price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly higher than Alice's perceived value of the product ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, Bob might prompt Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her actual valuation."
