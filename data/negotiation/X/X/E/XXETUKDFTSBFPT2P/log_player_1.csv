{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,150,000. This price is a reflection of the product's unique value and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but still significantly above my minimum ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer with enthusiasm and confidence, highlighting the product's value and potential. This helps create a positive atmosphere and encourages Bob to consider my offer seriously.
* **Room for Compromise:** By offering $1,150,000, I leave room for a counteroffer from Bob without compromising my minimum acceptable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to understand his position and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Counteroffers:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's acceptable or if I should make a counter-counteroffer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob stall or become too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer $1050000. This seems like a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would be a significant loss.
* **Potential for Counteroffer:**  I can still leverage my position by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I believe I can still secure a price closer to my desired range by making a strategic counteroffer in the next round. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a compromise closer to my ideal price.  I'll consider factors like Bob's willingness to pay and my desire to maximize profit.
* **Negotiation:** I'll continue negotiating with Bob, using the information I have about his willingness to pay and my minimum acceptable price to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **John as a Backup:**  I'll keep John's offer as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see you're eager to get this product. However, $1,050,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the product's unique value and potential, and it gives us both a chance to make this a successful transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

* **Compromise:** I'm emphasizing that this counteroffer represents a compromise, showing flexibility and a desire to find a solution.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer $1075000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and is closer to the value you've indicated.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us and will allow us to complete this deal successfully. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob has moved closer to my minimum, his offer of $1,075,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **John's Offer is More Attractive:** John's offer of $1,000,000 is actually more attractive than Bob's current offer, as it would at least guarantee me my minimum.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage in the negotiation. I can still make a counteroffer, potentially pushing Bob closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Considering John:**  I'll carefully weigh the potential outcome of further negotiations with Bob against the certainty of John's offer. 
* **Goal:**  I'll continue to strive for a price that maximizes my profit, while acknowledging the risks associated with continuing negotiations with Bob."
