* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see you're eager to get this product. However, $1050000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price still reflects the product's unique value and potential, and it gives us both a chance to make this a successful transaction. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still higher than the $1,000,000 it's worth to her. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate further, potentially getting closer to your target price.
* The risk of buying from John is still present, but there's room for negotiation with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1075000 is closer, it's still not quite meeting my needs.  To make this a win-win, I'm willing to go down to $1090000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and the price is now within your target range. 
* Accepting this offer saves you $10,000 compared to buying from John.
* Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but there's a risk Alice will refuse and you'll have to buy from John. 
* At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation don't outweigh the risk of losing the deal."
