Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage. Starting high allows you to potentially secure a much larger profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high price without revealing your absolute bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is positive and inviting, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer if the price is too high. 

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to gauge Bob's interest at a price significantly above your minimum. If he accepts, you win big. If he rejects or counter-offers, you can still negotiate down towards your guaranteed price with John."
