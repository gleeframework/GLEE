"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $6,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its importance to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I also have to consider the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is my final compromise on the price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000. Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $7,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering it to you for $8,500. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in this product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
