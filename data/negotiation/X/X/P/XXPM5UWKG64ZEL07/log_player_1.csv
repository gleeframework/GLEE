Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to save some money if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $8,500 is too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This reflects a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,750 is closer to what I want, I'm still not completely satisfied. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  However, $8,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $8,875. It's a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750 again, but I'd like to add a small concession. I'll throw in an additional service that's worth $200. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Even though it's a bit lower than what I initially hoped for, the additional service is worth $200, which brings the total value closer to what I'm looking for. It's better to close the deal now than risk losing him altogether or having to sell to John at a lower price."
