While I could push for a higher price, Bob seems to be firm at $1,550,000. Accepting this offer guarantees a $550,000 profit, which is a substantial gain. Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or me having to settle for John's $1,000,000.  At this point, the certainty of a significant profit outweighs the potential for a slightly higher, but less certain, outcome."
