"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This will hopefully encourage him to counter-offer, allowing us to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within $10,000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $15,000.  I'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I want to signal that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell. Hopefully, this will lead to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've been considering the value of your product and while I appreciate its quality, I'm still aiming to keep my budget under $10,000. Could we perhaps meet at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident that I can find a better deal. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go down to $11,250. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it shows I'm serious about making this deal work.  How about we close this now?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's latest offer but still above my minimum. I'm emphasizing the compromise I'm making to show my willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to accept the offer and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've been through several rounds of negotiation, and Bob isn't budging much from his price.  I'm not confident that I can get a price closer to my minimum with him, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure deal with John."
