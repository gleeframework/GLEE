Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit at $120.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  He's still getting a good deal at $120. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can potentially go higher if Bob counters, or lower if you need to close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is still profitable, it's not as high as you'd like to go. You want to see if you can push for a higher price, especially since Bob is clearly interested in the product.  You'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $105 isn't the highest price you could potentially get, it's close to your target.  The risk of rejecting and going through more rounds of negotiation is that Bob might walk away entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
