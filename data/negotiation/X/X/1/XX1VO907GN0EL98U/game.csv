"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $875,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the value you place on the product.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $875,000 is still a bit outside my budget, though.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $825,000.  It's a significant move from my last offer, and I believe it reflects the value of this product for me.  What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $825,000 is a significant concession, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, though. I'll meet you at $850,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to work with you to finalize the deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
