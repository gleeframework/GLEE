Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $10,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, which means getting as close to $12,000 as possible without pushing Bob away.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to be a bit bolder.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  Given its unique value, I believe a price of $11,500 is fair. It's a significant discount compared to what it's worth to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting high anchors the negotiation in your favor. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value,"" you subtly remind Bob of its worth to him.
* **""Fair"" Price:**  Framing it as fair implies you've carefully considered the value.
* **Discount Emphasis:** Pointing out the discount makes the offer more enticing.
* **Open to Discussion:** ""What do you think?"" keeps the door open for negotiation while showing confidence.

**Important Notes**

* Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go. 
* Remember, any price above $10,000 is a profit for you!"
