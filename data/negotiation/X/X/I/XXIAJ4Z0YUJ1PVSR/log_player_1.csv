Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but below my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob (""great deal,"" ""useful"") to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not making it a take-it-or-leave-it offer. I'm open to discussing and potentially adjusting the price.

This approach aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price and see if Bob is willing to compromise.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I have John's offer of $150 as a backup, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Close to My Minimum:** I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum of $150 but still potentially appealing to Bob.
* **Highlighting the Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is still a ""great deal"" for him at this price. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a compromise (""willing to come down"") to make it more palatable. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my earnings and reaching a potential agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think we can do better than $140. How about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is getting closer, but still below my minimum:**  $130 is a bit closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to more concessions, potentially pushing the price even lower.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** John is willing to buy the product for $150, which is a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

Given the guaranteed profit from John's offer, I'm choosing to sell the product to John to avoid further negotiation with Bob and ensure I achieve my minimum desired profit."
