"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its worth. My initial offer is $800000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to keep your investment within budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I can meet you halfway at $825000.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $780000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $810000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm glad we're still in negotiations. I can see that you're getting closer to my target, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $815000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",815000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already given you a significant discount from my initial offer.

"I understand your position, Alice. I've done my best to stay within our agreed-upon budget while also acknowledging the value of the product. However, I'm unable to accept $820000.
