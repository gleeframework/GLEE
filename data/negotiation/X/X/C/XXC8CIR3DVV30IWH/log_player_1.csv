Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

While I could push for more, accepting $130 from Bob is better than settling for $150 from John. This way, I make a decent profit and avoid potentially protracted negotiations."
