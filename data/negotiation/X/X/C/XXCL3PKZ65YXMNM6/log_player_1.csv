"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, leaving some room for negotiation.  It also includes a friendly message to establish a rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I understand its value to you, but I am only able to offer $7,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $8,000. I'm not willing to sell it for that low.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired amount in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down a little bit. How about $8,500?  That's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I would like to stick to my initial budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between, perhaps at $8,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,200 is very close to my minimum price of $8,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  it's a good deal considering the limited rounds left.  I'll accept his offer to avoid risking losing the sale altogether."
