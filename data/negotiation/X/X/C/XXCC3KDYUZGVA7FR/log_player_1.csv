Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal profit ($130) than John's offer ($100).
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not setting the price at the absolute maximum ($150) because it leaves space for Bob to counteroffer, leading to a potential compromise.
* **Being friendly:** A positive message increases the chances of Bob accepting the initial offer or engaging in a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested but I'm looking to spend closer to $120. What do you think?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob clearly values the product at $150, which is more than his offer of $120. This means there's still room for negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer, potentially securing a price closer to my initial $130 offer or even higher.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I'm showing him that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and that I'm willing to stand my ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to let it go for $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets you the product you want."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($120). This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not dropping my price too much, indicating that I'm still confident in the value of the product. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and encouraging tone keeps the negotiation positive and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
