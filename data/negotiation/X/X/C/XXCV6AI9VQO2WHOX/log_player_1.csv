"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening that leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play the game.  If he rejects, I'll have a better understanding of his range and can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than my minimum of $1,500,000, I believe I can do better. I'm going to try and counter-offer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.  I'm confident that with careful negotiation, I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm offering $1,750,000 as a counteroffer. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still above my minimum price. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also showcasing that I believe the product is worth more.  By meeting Bob halfway, I hope to encourage him to come up with a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get closer to $1,500,000. I'm going to try and counter-offer one more time before considering John's offer. This product is valuable, and I'm confident I can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

This is my final offer to Bob. I'm coming down to $1,550,000, which is just above my minimum and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a fair price considering the value of the product. If he rejects, I'll go with John's offer, as I'm getting close to the end of my negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm going to take John's offer. While I'm not thrilled about missing out on the potential for a higher price, I'm not confident that Bob will come up to my minimum price. I'm not willing to risk losing even more money by continuing negotiations. John's offer is a safe bet, and I'm happy to secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements."
