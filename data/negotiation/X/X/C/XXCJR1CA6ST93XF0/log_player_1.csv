""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a substantial profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It's significantly more than his perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers introduces a time pressure element, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

This offer aims to find a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
