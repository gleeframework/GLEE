"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value but still above my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm offering $13,500, which is halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price point for Bob, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer a higher price, accepting this offer ensures I don't risk losing the deal completely and end up selling to John for a lower amount."
