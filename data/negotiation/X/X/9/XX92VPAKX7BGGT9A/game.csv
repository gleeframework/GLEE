"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Could you consider that price?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more, how about $13,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
