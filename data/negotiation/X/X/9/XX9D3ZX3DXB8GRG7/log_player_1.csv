"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it immediately.  This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.  I'm confident that I can get a higher price than John's offer, as I know the product is worth more to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can still get a better price.  $9,500 is closer to my minimum than John's offer, but it's still below what I believe the product is worth to Bob.  I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,500. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  It's also a middle ground between Bob's offer and my minimum desired price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. I still believe I can get a higher price.  I'm confident that Bob values the product enough to meet me somewhere in the middle.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $10,000, which is my minimum threshold. I'm hoping that by making a clear and final offer, Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept.  This is also a good point to remind him that if he doesn't accept, I can easily sell to John for the same price."
