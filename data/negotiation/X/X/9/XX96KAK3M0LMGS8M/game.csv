"Alice,  $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is closer to $10000.  Would you be willing to come down to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $10000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $15000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still being fair to you.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $12500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I'm not comfortable going below $14000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Would you be willing to consider this final offer?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $14000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000.  Let's see if we can close the deal at that price.",13000.0,Bob,6,
