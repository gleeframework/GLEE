"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make you a serious offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a great starting point. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I place on the product. I'm open to further negotiations, but I think this is a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to find a number that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,175,000. This is a significant step forward from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,200,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. I'm open to further negotiations, but I think this is a reasonable offer. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
