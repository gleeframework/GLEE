Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you think?
