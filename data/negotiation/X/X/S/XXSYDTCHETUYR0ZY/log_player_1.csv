"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 
 
I'm starting with my highest desired price. I know it's a stretch, but I'm hoping to secure a good price close to my minimum valuation.  If Bob rejects, I'm ready to negotiate further, but I'll always have the option of selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore it further. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm offering $1,100,000. This is still a significant price for Bob, but it's a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not yet ready to sell for less than $1,000,000 and believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a substantial offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a good compromise. It's closer to his value, and it's only slightly below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to accept it and close the deal. This secures a good sale, and avoids the risk of losing the deal to John."
