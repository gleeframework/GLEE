"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to land closer to his $1,000,000 limit. This initial move demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate and sets a lower starting point for further discussions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's limit. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a better price.  There are still 7 rounds left, giving Bob time to see if he can reach an agreement closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly, showing willingness to compromise.  He's likely hoping Alice will meet him halfway, especially given that he's already rejected her last offer.  This strategy allows Bob to gradually increase his offer while staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget.  While it's getting closer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He has 5 rounds remaining, and there's a good chance Alice might be willing to drop her price further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his maximum price. This is a bold move, but it demonstrates Bob's seriousness about closing the deal. If Alice wants to sell the product, she needs to accept this offer.  If she rejects it, Bob is ready to buy from John.  This creates a sense of urgency and pressure on Alice to accept."
