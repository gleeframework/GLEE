Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **My Minimum:** I need at least $1,000,000 for the product.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,000,000 from John.

By offering $1,400,000, I am:

* **Maximizing Potential Gain:** I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's value as possible.
* **Minimizing Risk:** I'm still ensuring a profit of $400,000, which is much better than the $1,000,000 I'd get from John.

This offer is a good balance between maximizing potential profit and mitigating risk."
