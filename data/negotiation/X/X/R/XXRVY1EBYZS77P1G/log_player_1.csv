Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Using a friendly and inviting tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not offering the absolute highest price I'd accept, ensuring there's some room to compromise if Bob counteroffers. 

I'm confident that this initial offer will start the negotiation process in a way that maximizes my potential earnings while still being appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$130 is still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Opportunity to potentially get closer to my desired price:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my initial offer of $140, potentially reaching a compromise closer to my desired range. 
* **Testing Bob's interest:** Rejecting the offer also demonstrates my willingness to stand my ground and shows Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I am maintaining my leverage and aiming for a better outcome in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $135.  That's still a good value for you, and it gives us both a fair deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $130. 
* **Reinforcing value:** I emphasize the value proposition for Bob, reminding him that $135 is still a good deal considering his perceived value of $150.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** Using a positive and encouraging tone aims to keep Bob engaged and motivated to reach a deal.

By offering a compromise and highlighting the value for both parties, I hope to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I was thinking more like $128. That's my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $128 is just slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a high chance he will walk away.  
* **Limited room for further negotiation:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer, making further negotiation unlikely.

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit.  The risk of losing the deal and only receiving $120 from John makes accepting Bob's offer the most logical choice."
