Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see how far he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,000.  This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows a willingness to compromise. I believe this is a fair price, considering my minimum acceptable price and Bob's willingness to negotiate."
