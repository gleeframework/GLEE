"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80. Let me know if you're open to that.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $100. Is that something you'd be interested in?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $80.  If you're not comfortable with that, I may need to look elsewhere.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're interested in the product, but I really need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $100, so I'll offer it to you for $90. Is that a price you'd be comfortable with?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $90 is still a bit too much for me. I'm still hoping we can settle on $80.  I'm very interested in the product, but I just can't go higher than that.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'll make one more compromise, and offer it to you for $92. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",92.0,Alice,7,
