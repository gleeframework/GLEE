Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think you'll find it's excellent value for the price."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I know the product is worth $150 to me. Accepting his offer would mean losing potential profit. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), it's the most logical choice to maximize my earnings."
