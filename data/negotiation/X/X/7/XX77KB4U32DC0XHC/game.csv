"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $950,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us and help us reach a quick agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
