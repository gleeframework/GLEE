Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

Bob's latest offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I'm confident John will buy the product for my desired price.  I'm choosing to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John."
