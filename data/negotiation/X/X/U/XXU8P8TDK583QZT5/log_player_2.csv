"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'm interested in buying the product, but I want to save as much money as I can. Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than what I'd pay if I buy from John, but it's still more than what the product is worth to Alice. I'll try to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal. However, since Alice has already made an offer, I'll consider it for now.
