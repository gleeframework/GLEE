"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its worth to you and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
