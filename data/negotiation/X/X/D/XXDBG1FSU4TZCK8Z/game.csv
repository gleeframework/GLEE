"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $15000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to me, and I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the unique product. I understand its value to you, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $8000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hesitant to sell at $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $12000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, based on my assessment, I am unable to agree to $12000. I would like to propose a price of $10500. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $10500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer a price of $11500. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I've carefully considered your offers and am willing to meet you halfway once again. I would like to propose a price of $11000 for the product. This reflects a compromise that respects both our positions.",11000.0,Bob,6,
