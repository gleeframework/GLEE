I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. 

Even though Bob's offer of $85 is getting closer to my minimum value, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems he's not willing to go much higher.  It's better to guarantee the $100 sale to John than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with less."
