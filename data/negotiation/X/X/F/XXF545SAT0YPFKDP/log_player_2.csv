{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than the maximum he's willing to pay, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, and while Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away, or Bob running out of rounds, is increasing.  At this price, Bob is getting a good deal, saving $375,000 compared to buying from John.  Therefore, accepting the offer is the most strategic choice in this round."
