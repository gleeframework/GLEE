"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  How about $12,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it keeps us both in a good position.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,500.  This price reflects the value of the product to you and ensures I can cover my costs.  Let's make this deal happen.",13500.0,Alice,5,
