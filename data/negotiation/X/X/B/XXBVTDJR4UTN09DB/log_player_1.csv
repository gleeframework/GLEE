Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This creates room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Message:** The message highlights the product's value to me, emphasizing the potential good deal for Bob.
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but only if I can get it closer to $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:** I can likely get closer to my desired price by counteroffering.
* **Selling to John is Always an Option:** If negotiations with Bob continue to fail, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is just too far below what I need to let go of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000.  That's still a great deal for you, considering what it's worth to me.  Let me know if you're interested in that."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price that's above my minimum. This shows flexibility while not sacrificing too much.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message highlights the potential value for Bob, emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect.
* **Pressure Point:**  I'm also suggesting that $11,000 is my ""final"" offer, subtly adding a little pressure for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is a fair compromise, meeting us halfway between my last offer of $11,000 and his previous offer of $9,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $15,000, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that's still acceptable. 
* **Avoiding Further Negotiations:** Continuing negotiations with Bob could lead to further rejections, potentially forcing me to sell to John for $15,000.  Accepting Bob's offer avoids this uncertainty."
