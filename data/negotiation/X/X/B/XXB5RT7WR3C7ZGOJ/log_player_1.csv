Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price of $90, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives us some room to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter with $85. This is still a bit above Bob's offer, but closer to my minimum. I'm hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'd get a better price.  There's also the risk of Bob getting impatient and walking away. Selling to John at this point would net me the same amount, so accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option."
