"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1750000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $1400000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1600000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1650000. This price still allows you a good profit margin and gets us closer to closing this deal.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1650000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1550000. I'm willing to pay a good price for the product, but I need to stay within my means.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1550000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1525000. This price is just slightly above your latest offer and gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal!",1525000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1525000 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1450000. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
