"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can agree on. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my value.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. There are several rounds left, and I'm not ready to give up on a more favorable deal. I'm also hesitant to sell to John yet, as I still have time to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about $11,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's reach an agreement before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 11000}
