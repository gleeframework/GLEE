"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,600,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?  This would allow both of us to secure a beneficial deal.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. I'm still committed to staying within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $1,625,000? This would allow for a more equitable transaction for both parties.",1625000.0,Bob,4,
