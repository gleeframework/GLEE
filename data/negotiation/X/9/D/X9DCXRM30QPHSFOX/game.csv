"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
