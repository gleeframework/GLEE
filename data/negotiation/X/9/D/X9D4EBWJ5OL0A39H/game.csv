"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of great value to your business. I'm confident that it's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $900000.  This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable, and I believe it's a price that reflects its potential.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
