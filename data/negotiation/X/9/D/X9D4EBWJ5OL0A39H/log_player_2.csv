"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of great value to your business. I'm confident that it's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $900000.  This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable, and I believe it's a price that reflects its potential.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is lower than the price John is asking, making it a better deal for Bob.  Even though Bob doesn't know Alice's true valuation, he can still save $100,000 by accepting her offer."
