"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?  That leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000, which is the price I'm willing to pay for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
