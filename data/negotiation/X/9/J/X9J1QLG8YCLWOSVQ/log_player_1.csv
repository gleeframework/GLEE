Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still keeping the price well above your minimum acceptable amount ($800,000). 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, maximizing profit. If he rejects the offer, you still have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
