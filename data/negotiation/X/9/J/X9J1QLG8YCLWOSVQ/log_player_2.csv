"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is under your $1,000,000 maximum, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her.  There's a chance she'll come down further, getting you a better deal."
