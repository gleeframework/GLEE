Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This gives you a significant price advantage over what you initially offered, and it allows me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment. Let's make this deal happen.
