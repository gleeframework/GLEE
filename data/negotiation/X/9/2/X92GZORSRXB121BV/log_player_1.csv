{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a better deal.  I'm also framing the message in a friendly way to encourage a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find similar products for a lower price elsewhere. Could we negotiate down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get a better price.  While $95 is better than what Bob originally offered, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I go down to $102.50? That's still a great price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 102.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of your product, I would like to propose $97.50 as my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $97.50 is close to my minimum, it's still below my target.  I'm confident that I can get $100 from John, so I'm going to sell to him instead of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
