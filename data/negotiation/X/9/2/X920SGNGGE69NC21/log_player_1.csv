{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit.  It's also a friendly approach, setting a positive tone for the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or at least secure the $10,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $10,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm sticking to a price higher than my minimum while acknowledging Bob's offer. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while still leaving some room for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I think $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to go below $10,000.  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so there's no need to rush into a deal that doesn't meet my price.  I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Bob, but if he doesn't come up, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm confident this product is worth the investment. How about we split the difference at $10,000? This is my final offer, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get.  Let me know if you're ready to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering my minimum acceptable price, and I'm making it clear that this is my final offer. This puts the pressure on Bob to decide if he wants the product at this price.  If he doesn't, I'll move on to John."
