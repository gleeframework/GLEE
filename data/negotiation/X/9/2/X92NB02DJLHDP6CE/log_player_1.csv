``` 

This offer gives me a healthy profit while leaving room for negotiation.  It also shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product to him, but I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept and get the deal done, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is simply too low. The product is worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer one last time. If he rejects this, I'll sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000. This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll be selling the product to another buyer.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
