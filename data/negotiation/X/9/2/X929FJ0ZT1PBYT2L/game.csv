"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  I've put a lot into developing this product and $1,200,000 wouldn't reflect its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you've invested a lot in the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
