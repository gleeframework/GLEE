"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get the price lower before committing."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  The product is intriguing, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which is still a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $850,000, which is still a great deal for you, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can still do better. $850,000 is a significant improvement over $1,200,000, but Alice is willing to negotiate. A counteroffer will allow Bob to try to get a price closer to his ideal range, especially since Alice already lowered her price."
