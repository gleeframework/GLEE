Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:**  This price is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) but leaves room for negotiation, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and sets a positive tone while highlighting the value proposition for Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a fair deal. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price point.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can reach a more favorable agreement. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a compromise closer to $13,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to finding a compromise, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250? This would be a fair price considering both our perspectives."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,250:** This price is the midpoint between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,500). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:** The message reinforces a collaborative tone and highlights a desire for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,750? This is a bit closer to my original target, and I'm willing to make a compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,750 is only $250 less than my minimum acceptable price. At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether. It's more advantageous to accept his offer and secure a sale, ensuring I receive a price that is significantly higher than selling to John."
