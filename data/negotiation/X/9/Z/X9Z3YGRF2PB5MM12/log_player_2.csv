"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her value for the product. There's room for negotiation here to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and express continued interest.** 
* **Subtly signal awareness of the product's potential value to Alice** by starting a bit above her estimated value. 
* **Leave room for further negotiation** while still aiming for a price significantly below Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  How about we split the difference and meet at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $100 is still too high.  There's a good chance we can negotiate further down within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  To be honest, I was hoping to spend closer to $90 for it.  Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **Continuing to negotiate:** We're still well below Alice's initial offer and within our own budget.
* **Targeting a price slightly above Alice's value:** Offering $90 aims for a price where both parties win, but with Bob getting the slightly better end of the deal.
* **Clear and direct communication:** We're stating our desired price point openly, encouraging Alice to respond in kind."
