"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. Given its potential, I'm asking for $950,000.  This price reflects its worth and allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable and would allow me to make a profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a substantial profit for you. Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. I think this price is more in line with its value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still hopeful we can reach an agreement. While I appreciate your offer of $875,000, I'm not quite there yet. To finalize this deal, I'd need to receive $890,000 for the product.  This represents a fair value for both of us. I'm confident that this product will bring significant gains to your business, and I'm willing to be flexible to make this happen.",890000.0,Alice,5,
