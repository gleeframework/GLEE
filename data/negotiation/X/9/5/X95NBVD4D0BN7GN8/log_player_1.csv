Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, but I'm also confident that John is a reliable backup option if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter-offer with $8,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit."
