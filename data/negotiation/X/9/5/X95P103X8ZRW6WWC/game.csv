"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to negotiations.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
