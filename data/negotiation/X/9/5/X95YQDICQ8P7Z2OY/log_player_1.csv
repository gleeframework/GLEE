Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob a chance to bargain, while still ensuring a profit for Alice that is closer to her desired value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to Alice's desired value, it's still lower than what she's willing to accept. She can likely negotiate a higher price by making a counteroffer. Selling to John at this point would mean missing out on potentially getting a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

Alice is willing to compromise but still wants to get as close to her desired value as possible. A counteroffer of $13,500 shows that she's willing to negotiate but also signals that she's not willing to drop her price too much."
