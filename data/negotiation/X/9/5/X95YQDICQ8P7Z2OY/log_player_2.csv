"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget.  You have room to negotiate, and it's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $12,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but it's still within the realm of what the product is worth to me. My hope is that Alice will be willing to negotiate a bit to avoid losing the sale altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is still above my ideal price, but it's within my budget and a good compromise. Buying from John for $12,000 is the better deal, but the risk is that Alice might not be willing to go any lower, and I might lose the opportunity to purchase.  

It's worth taking this offer to secure the product and potentially save time and effort compared to further negotiating with Alice."
