"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a one-time price of $1,200,000. This is a rare chance to acquire a high-value item that will bring you significant benefits and returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $800,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of a better counter-offer from Alice or lets you proceed with buying from John at your preferred price."
