Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm proposing a price of $11,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's an opportunity to sell to Bob for even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price ($11,000) makes it very appealing to Bob, as it represents a significant saving for him compared to its actual worth to him ($8,000).
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly eliminates the need to wait for John and avoids any potential complications that could arise. 

This strategy aims to secure a quick and highly profitable sale by offering a price that's beneficial for both you and Bob."
