"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can likely get a better price than $11,500. Since you're willing to pay up to $12,000, there's room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to my original asking price. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is closer to your counteroffer of $11,000.  While you could continue negotiating,  $11,250 is still a good price for you and saves you $750 compared to buying from John."
