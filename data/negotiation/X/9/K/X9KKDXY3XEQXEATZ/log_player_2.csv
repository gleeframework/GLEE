"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth negotiating, especially when there's a significant difference between the initial offer and your target price.  By rejecting, you open the door to a potential counteroffer that could be more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $600,000 is a significant drop from her initial offer and reflects my desire to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is closer to my target price, I'm still not satisfied. I'll continue to negotiate, hoping to push Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly from the last round.  $700,000 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Alice will see the value in getting closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down a bit, I still see room for further negotiation.  I'm willing to keep pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 710000}
```

I'm going to try a smaller increment this time.  $710,000 is a good compromise, and I think Alice might be getting closer to accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $730,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $730,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now offering a price that is very close to my target price.  Even though I've only got 3 rounds left, it's not worth risking it all to try to push for an even lower price. It's time to close the deal."
