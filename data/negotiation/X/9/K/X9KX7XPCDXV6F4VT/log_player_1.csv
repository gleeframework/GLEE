Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation and my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, I'm emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""value and potential."" This framing aims to make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Fallback option:** I'm secure knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000. This allows me to be more assertive in my negotiation with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, I may be willing to negotiate the price down. However, my goal is to secure the highest possible price."
