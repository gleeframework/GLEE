"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the value to Bob helps make the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  I'm not going for a ""take it or leave it"" approach.  This encourages negotiation and keeps the door open for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  
* **I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John.**  This makes accepting Bob's offer risky.
* **Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.**  I have 9 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is still a great price for you, considering you value the product at $10,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer but moving closer to his price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  Suggesting a midpoint price is a common negotiation tactic, making the offer seem fair.
* **Reiterate Value:** Reminding Bob of the value he places on the product reinforces the potential benefit for him. 
* **Open to Agreement:** I'm expressing a desire to reach an agreement, keeping the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $16,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** This is a good deal for me.
* **Selling to John would only net me $15,000, the same as Bob's offer.**  There's no advantage to going with John.
* **Accepting allows me to close the deal quickly.**  There's no guarantee that Bob will accept a counteroffer, and I'm getting a fair price."
