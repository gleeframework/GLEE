Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $140, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $140 is your initial offer, there might be a slight possibility to negotiate a higher price.
* **Securing a Sale:**  The offer is significantly more attractive to Bob than walking away. 

This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting your offer while still ensuring you make a substantial profit."
