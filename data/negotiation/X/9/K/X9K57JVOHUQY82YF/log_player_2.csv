"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $2,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects the value it offers. Let's discuss further! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $2,000,000 is quite high. I'm interested, but only if it's within a more reasonable range. How about we consider $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $600,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it establishes a starting point for negotiation. It's better to begin with an offer that favors us and allows room for compromise.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message maintains a polite and professional tone, acknowledging Alice's offer while clearly stating our position.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $600,000, we signal a willingness to negotiate but also set a firm lower boundary. This gives Alice the opportunity to counter-offer and move closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $600,000 is far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, recognizing your needs. This is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll gain. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice lowered her price, $1,200,000 is still significantly above our $800,000 maximum budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's message suggests a willingness to negotiate further. Rejecting this offer encourages her to move closer to a price we can accept. 
* **John is a Backup:** We have the safety net of buying from John at $800,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  I can offer $700,000. This shows my serious interest, and I believe it's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  We're increasing our offer, but strategically staying well below both Alice's price and our $800,000 limit.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between our initial low offer and Alice's high counter-offers.
* **Conveying Seriousness:** By increasing the offer, we show Alice that we're serious about buying but still need her to be realistic on price. 
* **Time Consideration:** As we progress through the rounds, it's important to make more substantial moves to signal our interest and encourage a quicker resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that still allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Still Too High:**  $900,000 is getting closer to our budget, but it's still $100,000 over what we're willing to pay.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We still have the option to buy from John for $800,000, giving us leverage to push for a better price from Alice. 
* **Later Rounds:** We're now past the halfway point in the negotiation.  Alice may be more willing to make a significant concession as we get closer to the end."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that works for me. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $800,000.  If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're now laying our cards on the table and presenting our absolute maximum budget. This shows Alice we're serious and not willing to budge further.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating our willingness to ""close the deal today,"" we add a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to make a decision.
* **John Option Remains:** While we're revealing our limit, we haven't closed the door on buying from John. This provides a subtle pressure point for Alice to accept. 
* **Respectful Tone:** We're maintaining a respectful tone throughout, recognizing Alice's compromises while firmly stating our position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $800,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise, but it also reflects the value I place on this product and on our potential partnership. Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has not significantly budged from her $1,000,000 offer, indicating she may not be willing to meet our $800,000 limit. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds left, continuing to negotiate with Alice risks running out of time and potentially losing both deals.
* **Guaranteed Savings:** John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, which is our target budget. Buying from him ensures we get the product at the best possible price.

It's time to cut our losses with Alice and secure a good deal with John."
