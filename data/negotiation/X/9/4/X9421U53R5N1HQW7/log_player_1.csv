Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a rare chance to acquire something truly unique."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the waters:**  A significantly higher offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a much higher profit.
* **Room for negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, there's space to negotiate down towards $1,000,000 while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential profit while acknowledging your fallback option with John."
