"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his perceived value and can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly less than my minimum value of $1,200,000.  While I'm aware that he might be trying to lowball me, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this encourages Bob to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below it.  I'm not ready to accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is only $50,000 above my minimum, and I believe it demonstrates my willingness to compromise. If Bob rejects this offer, I might seriously consider selling to John, as I'm running out of time and room to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $1,200,000, but we're getting closer. I'm going to counteroffer one more time before I seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,175,000. This is only $25,000 above Bob's last offer, and I'm hoping that it demonstrates my willingness to compromise and get this deal done. If he rejects this offer, I'm going to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
