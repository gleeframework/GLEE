"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking to bring the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $825,000 is closer, it's still a touch higher than I'd like. How about we settle at $760,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",760000.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, which is just $5,000 above your last offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",795000.0,Alice,5,,
