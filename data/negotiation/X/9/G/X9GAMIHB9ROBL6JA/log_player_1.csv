Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** $1,200,000 is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for negotiation space.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as fair and appealing, emphasizing the value for Bob. 
* **Strategic thinking:**  I'm setting a high initial price, leaving room for negotiation, and keeping John as a fallback option. If Bob rejects this offer, I can  lower the price a bit more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am able to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  Even though it's closer to my minimum acceptable price than his previous offer, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount.
* **I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.** This allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price. 
* **I still have John as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,000,000. How about $1,150,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm increasing Bob's offer by $150,000, moving closer to his perceived value but still keeping a margin for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while reiterating my desire for a higher price. I'm framing this counteroffer as a ""good deal"" for both of us.
* **Strategic thinking:** By offering a slightly lower price, I'm showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to consider my offer while still aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose $1,100,000 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 than any previous offer.** While it's still less than I'd like, it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Accepting Bob's offer allows me to sell the product without having to go through further negotiation.** This saves time and effort, and it's a good outcome considering the risk of further negotiations.
* **While selling to John would yield a higher profit, the risk of further negotiations with Bob might lead to a lower final price.**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a secure sale for a price that's acceptable to me."
