Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm confident that this product will bring you significant value exceeding the $1,200,000 it's worth to both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price given our current negotiation and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is not willing to meet at a price point that makes staying in the negotiation worthwhile. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
