"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm confident that this product will bring you significant value exceeding the $1,200,000 it's worth to both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price given our current negotiation and the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
