"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that is truly exceptional.  It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to consider a reasonable offer. I believe this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you as well.  What do you think about a price of $1500000?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but my budget is limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $800000 is a good starting point, it's significantly below the value I've placed on this product. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This would still be a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
