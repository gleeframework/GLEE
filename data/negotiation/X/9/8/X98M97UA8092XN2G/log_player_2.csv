Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below the product's true value. It has the potential to generate significant returns for you, and I'm sure you'll agree that a slightly higher investment will be worth it in the long run.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $980,000 is still not quite there.  This product is truly unique and has the potential to generate substantial returns for your business. I believe a price closer to $1 million would be a more equitable reflection of its value.
