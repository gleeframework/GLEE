"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a fortune, and I'm sure it would be a game-changer for you. My initial price is $1,200,000. This reflects the product's true value and my confidence in its potential. Let's discuss!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's truly unique and has the potential to significantly benefit your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I still think $1,100,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below the product's true value. It has the potential to generate significant returns for you, and I'm sure you'll agree that a slightly higher investment will be worth it in the long run.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. ",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $980,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value to me, while also being mindful of my financial constraints.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $980,000 is still not quite there.  This product is truly unique and has the potential to generate substantial returns for your business. I believe a price closer to $1 million would be a more equitable reflection of its value. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000.  This is a fair price that considers the product's value and your budget. ",1020000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still hesitant to go above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, so I'm counteroffering $1,010,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget constraints.",1010000.0,Bob,8,
