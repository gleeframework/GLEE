,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd like to offer $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,750 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  Let's try $10,500. It's a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
