"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to earn a bit more than my minimum requirement.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
