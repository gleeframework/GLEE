"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $75? That's a fair offer, considering its current market value.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're a savvy negotiator! I'm willing to meet you at $90, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,
