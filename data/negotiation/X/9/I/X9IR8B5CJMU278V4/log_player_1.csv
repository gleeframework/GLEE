Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  While I recognize the potential value of this product, I'm only able to offer $1,250,000 at this time. This is my best and final offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,850,000? This reflects a more realistic price point while still providing you with a great asset."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,850,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise. This offer reflects the value I see in the product, while also acknowledging its current market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, but he's still significantly under our minimum. We're better off countering again and seeing if we can push him closer to the $1,500,000 mark, which is our safety net with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a stronger commitment from your side. Let's settle this at $1,650,000. This price acknowledges the value you're getting and allows us both to walk away satisfied."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm confident that $1,550,000 is a fair price that benefits both of us.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close this deal before we run out of time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now offering more than our safety net with John. While we could push for more, it's getting late in the negotiation, and there's a risk he'll walk away. Taking the $1,550,000 ensures a profitable deal and avoids the potential of losing him as a buyer."
