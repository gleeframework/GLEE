"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return on investment you can expect.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  While I recognize the potential value of this product, I'm only able to offer $1,250,000 at this time. This is my best and final offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,850,000? This reflects a more realistic price point while still providing you with a great asset.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,850,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise. This offer reflects the value I see in the product, while also acknowledging its current market value.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a stronger commitment from your side. Let's settle this at $1,650,000. This price acknowledges the value you're getting and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm confident that $1,550,000 is a fair price that benefits both of us.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close this deal before we run out of time.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
