Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is too high for him, and he can get it for less. He should try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $16,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.

Bob should reject the offer. He is still trying to get a better price and $16,000 is still higher than his target. He should continue to negotiate and make a counteroffer."
