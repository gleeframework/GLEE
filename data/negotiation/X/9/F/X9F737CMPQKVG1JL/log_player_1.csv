Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're not giving it away, and still leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's significantly lower than Bob's value:**  This gives Bob incentive to negotiate and potentially make a deal.
* **It's not too aggressive:** You're not immediately pushing Bob away with an unreasonable price. 

This strategy aims to create a negotiation where you can potentially reach a price closer to Bob's perceived value while still earning a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but based on my assessment, I am only willing to pay $950000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good amount, it's still significantly lower than your desired outcome. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and push for a better price, potentially closer to your desired $1,200,000. 

You're not in a rush to sell to John at a much lower price, so rejecting Bob's offer is the most strategic move. This opens the door for further negotiation and potentially a higher final price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** You're showing flexibility by dropping your price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000. 
* **Maintain your value:** $1,100,000 is still significantly more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **Positive message:** You're framing the counteroffer as a potential ""middle ground"", making it more appealing to Bob.

This counteroffer balances the need to be firm on your value with the desire to reach an agreement. You're signaling that you're open to negotiating further while maintaining a price that's still profitable for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1050000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a compromise:**  Bob's offer is closer to your ideal price than John's offer. It's a significant improvement over his previous offer.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** There's a good chance that continued negotiation will only lead to further back-and-forth, potentially dragging out the process and increasing the risk of losing Bob as a buyer.
* **Time is money:** Accepting the offer ensures a sale and avoids the potential of Bob walking away or you losing interest in the deal. 

While you might prefer a price closer to $1,100,000, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision at this point. You secure a good profit and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
