"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm selling it for $120, which is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance you could get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting the offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer or a lower price from Alice."
