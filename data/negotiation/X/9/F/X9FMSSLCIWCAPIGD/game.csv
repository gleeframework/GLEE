"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1100000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for this product. This is the highest I can go,  let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $950000. This is my best counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not ready to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $900000, which would be $925000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
