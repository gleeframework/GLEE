"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can get good use out of the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and $9500 is a more reasonable number.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to $10000 for the product. How about we split the difference and settle on $9750?  This would ensure a good deal for both of us.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9750.  It's getting close.  I'm really hoping to get it for $9500, though.  If you're willing to come down to that, I'd be happy to take it off your hands today.",9500.0,Bob,6,
