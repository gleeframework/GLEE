I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  This maximizes my potential profit. If he rejects, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my price without risking a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though it's closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price that is more acceptable to me.  While I could sell to John for $1,200,000, I am still hoping to get closer to that value with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a compromise - a significant decrease from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will push Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to meet my price. I've already made several concessions and it's clear he won't go higher. It's time to move on and sell to John for my desired price."
