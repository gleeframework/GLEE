"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $82 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $78?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. I can do $81 for the product. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise.",81.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $81 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $79.50. Can you consider that?",79.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I can do $79.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",79.5,Alice,7,
