{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive and enthusiastic tone to make Bob feel good about the offer.
* **Confidence in value:** I'm suggesting that the product is a good deal for Bob, increasing his perception of its value.

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** The higher starting price gives me more room to negotiate.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** Bob's response will give me a sense of how much he values the product.
* **Maintain control:** By making the first offer, I establish the initial price point and set the tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you be able to consider a price closer to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for better negotiation:** Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value, potentially reaching a compromise that benefits both of us.
* **John as a safety net:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the security to reject Bob's offer without significant financial risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $80 is significantly lower than what I need to sell this product. I'm willing to come down to $120. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm counteroffering with $120, which is halfway between my minimum price ($150) and Bob's offer ($80). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my financial interests.
* **Highlighting the value:** I reiterate the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my counteroffer.
* **Open to discussion:** I leave the door open for further negotiation by asking Bob if the offer works for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While $120 is still a bit out of my budget, I would like to propose $95 as a potential compromise. I hope this aligns better with your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better outcome:** I believe there's still room to negotiate, and rejecting this offer allows me to make a final counteroffer before deciding to sell to John. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Having John as a fallback option gives me the flexibility to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $107.50? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while still staying within your budget."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is my final counteroffer before resorting to selling to John. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price exactly halfway between my previous offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($95).  This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to reach a compromise. 
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I reiterate that this price is fair for both of us, highlighting the benefits for Bob.
* **Decision Point:** By making this final offer, I'm putting the ball in Bob's court.  If he rejects, I'll move forward with selling to John."
