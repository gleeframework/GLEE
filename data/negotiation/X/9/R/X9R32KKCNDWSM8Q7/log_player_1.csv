Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a lower price to make it work. How about $9,000?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.
