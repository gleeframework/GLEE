"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to showcase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to my minimum ($1,200,000) than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" I'm framing the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Leaving Room:** The message implies willingness to negotiate by stating it's ""an offer,""  not an ultimatum.

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the option of John ($1,200,000) as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good price considering the value you've described. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While it's a step in the right direction, I have room to negotiate. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John at this point would be a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is a strong offer, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value you're getting."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've made a noticeable concession ($30,000) from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Holding Ground:**  The new price is still significantly closer to my minimum than Bob's offer, reinforcing the product's value. 
* **Compromise Language:**  Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""acknowledging the value"" aims to frame the offer positively. 

I believe this strategy keeps the negotiation moving while avoiding large concessions early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,120,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, which reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits. Let's bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are making progress, but $1,080,000 is still too far from my $1,200,000 safety net.  Bob is clearly engaged and willing to negotiate. I'll continue the negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us considering the product's unique value."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between the previous offers, suggesting a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Finality:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I create a sense of urgency and communicate that I'm firm on this price. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price and make it harder to reject outright.

This strategy aims to either secure a price I find acceptable or prompt Bob to reveal if he's genuinely willing to pay closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I value the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,090,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial limits.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is increasing in smaller increments, and he's sticking firmly to his budget limitations.  While I could likely continue to negotiate, the potential gains are minimal at this point.  

It's unlikely Bob will reach my $1,100,000 ""final offer,"" and I risk losing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John by continuing to haggle.  Time is also a factor, and I'm better off securing the guaranteed sale now."
