,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,600,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000,  but I'm not sure I can go higher.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 represents the high-end of the product's value, I understand your perspective.  Could you consider $1,400,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $1,200,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
