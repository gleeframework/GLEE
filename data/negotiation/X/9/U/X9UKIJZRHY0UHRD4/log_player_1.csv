Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 gives some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **High but Justifiable:** The price is high, but not unreasonable considering Bob's perceived value. The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fairness"" to add weight to the offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiating style or how desperate he is for the product. 
* If we knew more about Bob, we could potentially push for a higher price or be more flexible."
