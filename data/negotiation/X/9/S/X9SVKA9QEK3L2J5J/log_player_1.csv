Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $65?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $100 to make this work.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 100}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
