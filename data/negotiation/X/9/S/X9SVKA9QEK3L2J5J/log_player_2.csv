"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130.  I know it's worth a lot more to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $65?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $100 to make this work.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  $100 is closer, but I'm still working with a tight budget.  Would you be willing to do $75?  That's a fair compromise, I think."", 
""product_price"": 75
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $75 is still too low. I'm willing to go down to $90, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to go much lower than $90. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $80, your maximum budget."
