# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting with an offer of $950000. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  While I think this product has great value,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, how about $875,000? This would give us both a fair deal and hopefully bring us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. Let's try one more time. I'm willing to come down to $890000. This price is a fair compromise, considering the value of this product.  Let's close this deal and make it happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now come down to $890,000, which is only $40,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer. This is a pretty good deal for Bob, as he would save $110,000 compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and avoids further negotiation rounds. There's always a risk that Alice might reject his next counteroffer, so accepting at this point is the safer option."
