"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting with an offer of $950,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening Offer:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This is a good strategy to gauge Bob's interest and set the stage for potential counteroffers. 
* **Message:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport and encourage a collaborative negotiation. I emphasize the product's value to Bob to subtly increase his desire. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A counteroffer from Bob is likely. This initial offer gives me flexibility to adjust the price based on his response. 
* **Option to sell to John:** Remember, I have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out. This provides a safety net and allows me to confidently negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  While I think this product has great value,  $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'll aim to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on. This negotiation is about finding a win-win situation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $900,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's desire for a good deal, but also emphasize the product's value to justify my counteroffer.  I frame the price as a ""split the difference"" solution, making it seem fair and appealing.
* **Maintaining Confidence:** I continue to express optimism for reaching an agreement.  This helps maintain a positive tone and encourages Bob to consider my offer. 

**Remember:** I still have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through. This gives me the confidence to hold firm on a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, how about $875000? This would give us both a fair deal and hopefully bring us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm not ready to settle for $875,000 yet. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a compromise that's more favorable to me. I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $800,000, so I have a safety net if this negotiation fails.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. Let's try one more time. I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This price is a fair compromise, considering the value of this product.  Let's close this deal and make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 890000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $890,000, which is a smaller concession than Bob's last offer. This demonstrates that I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's efforts and emphasize the fairness of my offer.  I'm also using positive language like ""close this deal"" to motivate Bob to accept.
* **Staying Firm:**  I'm nearing my minimum, but I'm still holding firm on a price that allows me to achieve my desired profit.

**Remember:** I still have the option to sell to John for $800,000, which gives me leverage in this negotiation."
