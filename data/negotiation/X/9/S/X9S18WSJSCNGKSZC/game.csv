"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $10,500?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll agree that it's a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you a little further, but I'd need $10,250 to make this deal work for me.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll come down to $10,000, but that's my final offer. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $10,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I'm starting to get a bit skeptical about the deal. Can you meet me at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,8,
