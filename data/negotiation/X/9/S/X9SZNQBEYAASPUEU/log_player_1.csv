Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer considering my financial constraints.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, $850,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I will need a higher offer to consider it."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and allows both of us to make a reasonable deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
