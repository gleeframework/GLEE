Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for the full $12,000 that it's worth to me. This is the best-case scenario for me, and I'm confident that I can get at least that much from John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with my own price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,500. This is a compromise between my original asking price and Bob's offer. I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price, but I'm also willing to be flexible to reach a deal."
