"Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering $125.  There's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for her to make a profit. It's likely she'll be willing to negotiate further, especially since she knows you're willing to pay up to $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is a good deal for Bob. It's still below his maximum price of $150, and it's likely that Alice will not budge further. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal."
