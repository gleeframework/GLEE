Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing us both a profitable outcome. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
