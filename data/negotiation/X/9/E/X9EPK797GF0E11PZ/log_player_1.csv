"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant amount above my minimum, and it gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial price.  If he's very interested, he might accept. If he's hesitant, it'll give us a starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm confident that with further negotiation, I can get a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,900,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves room for further discussion. I want to gauge if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I think I can get a better deal with further negotiation. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I still believe there's potential to make a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,850,000. This is a slight increase from his last offer, but it's still below my initial offer. I'm trying to meet him halfway while still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value.  We're getting close to the middle ground, and I want to see if he's willing to make one final compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While we're getting close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm not quite ready to accept his offer, but I also don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  I'll make one final counteroffer to try and close the gap."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. 

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, I've reached my limit for negotiation.  I've already made several concessions, and Bob doesn't seem willing to budge further. With only two rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal at all is too high.  Selling to John ensures that I get at least my minimum value and avoid the potential of losing the deal entirely."
