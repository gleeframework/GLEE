"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's close this deal quickly!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but it's still below the value Bob places on the product. This gives me room to negotiate if he rejects the offer. I'm also emphasizing the value he'll get from the deal to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. Given that the product is worth $800,000 to me, I would like to propose a price of $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is a lot closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle for $850,000 yet. I believe I can push for a better price, especially since I have several rounds left.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 isn't quite enough for me to let go of this valuable product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $875,000?  This is still below what the product is worth to you, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $860,000. I hope this helps us move closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm starting to run out of rounds and don't want to risk losing this deal altogether.  $860,000 is a good compromise, and I'm confident that I can still make a substantial profit from this sale."
