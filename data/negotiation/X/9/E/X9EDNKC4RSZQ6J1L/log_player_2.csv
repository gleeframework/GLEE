"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $150. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while staying within your budget.
* **Significant Difference:** By offering $60, you're creating a significant gap from both Alice's starting price and your true maximum. This might encourage her to engage in negotiation rather than dismissing your offer outright. 
* **Polite and Open:** The message remains polite and expresses interest, aiming to maintain a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest.  $60 is quite low, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate, $130 is still significantly higher than both your budget and what John offers. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $130 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $70? I feel that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Instead of making another large jump, we're increasing our offer incrementally to $70. This shows Alice that we're willing to negotiate but are also standing firm on our budget. 
* **Justification:** By saying  ""$130 is still more than I'm looking to spend,"" we're subtly reminding Alice that we have budget constraints and other options (John).
* **""Fair Offer"":**  Positioning your offer as ""fair""  can sometimes help sway the other party, even without explicitly listing out your justifications."
