,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? ",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
