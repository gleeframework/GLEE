"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1200000 is significantly below what I'm looking to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1750000? This reflects the true value and potential of this product, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1750000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1500000, which is the price I was originally considering from John. Can you do that?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
