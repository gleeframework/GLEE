"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still hoping to get closer to the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1100000. This is the best price I can offer at this point, considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit more than I can afford at this time. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1075000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1075000 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1080000, as that would be below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1090000. This is the best price I can offer at this point, considering the value I've placed on the product. What do you think?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1090000 is still above my budget. Considering the value we both see in this deal, I'm willing to offer $1070000. This is a fair price that reflects my financial limitations and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a compromise and close this deal.",1070000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1070000 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1080000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best price I can offer, considering the value I've placed on the product. If we can agree on this price, I'm willing to close the deal. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1080000 is still a bit outside my budget.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $1050000, which reflects my financial limitations and the value I place on this product.  Let's try to find a compromise and close this deal. I believe we're close to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
