{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your desire to negotiate but still shows respect for the product's value.

* **Leave room for negotiation:** This offer leaves space for further bargaining in subsequent rounds."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still hoping to get closer to the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1100000. This is the best price I can offer at this point, considering the product's worth to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,100,000 is still above your ideal price. 
* **You have more negotiation rounds.** By rejecting, you maintain leverage and can try to push for a lower price.
* **John's offer remains a good option.** Having a guaranteed purchase option with John provides security if negotiations with Alice fall apart."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can afford at this time.

Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant increase:** This counteroffer is a modest increase from your previous offer, showing flexibility while remaining within your budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1075000 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1080000, as that would be below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1090000. This is the best price I can offer at this point, considering the value I've placed on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer but still too high.** While it's tempting to accept at this point, your goal is to save as much money as possible.
* **More negotiation rounds available.** You have five rounds left, which is sufficient to try and squeeze out a better price.
* **John's offer is your safety net.** If negotiations with Alice fall apart, you have a guaranteed option with John at your desired price.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,090,000 is still above my budget. Considering the value we both see in this deal, I'm willing to offer $1,070,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's last offer and your previous one, demonstrating flexibility while still trying to save money.

* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** Stressing the value of the deal for both parties increases the likelihood of Alice accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1070000 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1080000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best price I can offer, considering the value I've placed on the product. If we can agree on this price, I'm willing to close the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but still not ideal:** $1,080,000 is getting very close to your goal, but you still have more rounds and can try to push for a lower price.
* **John's offer is still a strong backup:** You have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $1,000,000, providing a safety net if negotiations fail.
* **Alice's ""final offer"" is not binding.**  You can always reject and try to get a better deal.  By rejecting, you demonstrate that you're not desperate and maintain negotiating leverage.

With only three rounds left, you're in a good position to try and secure a price closer to your ideal $1,000,000."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,080,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which reflects my financial limitations and the value I place on this product.  Let's try to find a compromise and close this deal. I believe we're close to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:**  You're pushing for a price closer to your ideal target. While it might seem risky, you're nearing the end of the negotiation and need to make a bold move.
* **Emphasize your budget:**  Reiterating your budget constraints helps solidify your position and encourages Alice to make a final concession.
* **Focus on finding a compromise:**  You're acknowledging the potential for a deal, but it needs to be agreeable to both parties. 

This counteroffer puts the pressure on Alice, forcing her to decide whether she's willing to accept a lower price or risk losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1050000 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1060000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best price I can offer, considering the value I've placed on the product. If we can agree on this price, I'm willing to close the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **It's the best offer so far:** While not your ideal price, $1,060,000 is the closest Alice has come to your target, and you're only one round away from potentially buying from John for $1,000,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Rejecting and making another counteroffer could lead to Alice walking away, leaving you with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** This is your last chance to negotiate with Alice before having to commit to John's offer. 

By accepting, you secure a deal with Alice at a price slightly higher than your goal but still within your budget, avoiding the risk of a higher price from John."
