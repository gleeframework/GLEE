"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's initial offer is far too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price.  We'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay no more than $100, so we start with a significantly lower offer ($80) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Expressing Interest:** While lowballing, we maintain a friendly tone and express interest in the product to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room to Move:**  We avoid being too aggressive with our initial counteroffer, as it could make Alice less willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice came down in price, but $110 is still above our $100 budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and Alice seems open to finding a compromise.  We'll try to inch closer to our target price. 
* **John as Backup:**  It's good to keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option, but we're not ready to give up on getting a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up:** We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're serious and willing to compromise.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  Suggesting $95 is a classic negotiation tactic â€“ it aims to find a middle ground and can feel like a win-win to both parties.
* **Still Below Budget:** Importantly, $95 keeps us under our $100 budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $105 is still slightly above our $100 budget.
* **Few Rounds Remaining:**  While we have time, it's getting late in the negotiation. We need to signal that we're firm on our budget.
* **John's Offer:** It's becoming more tempting to take John's offer.  Rejecting here puts the pressure on Alice for her last move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility so far. To be honest, my absolute top price is $100.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to make a deal.  If not, I might need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're presenting our final offer of $100. This clearly signals to Alice that we're at our limit.
* **Polite but Firm:** We maintain a polite tone, but we also introduce a sense of urgency by mentioning ""other options"" (John).
* **Clear Decision Point:** This offer forces Alice to make a decision. She either accepts our final offer and makes the sale, or she risks losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your top price, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No More Room:** Alice's counteroffer shows she's not willing to meet our $100 maximum. It's unlikely she'll go any lower. 
* **Saving Money:**  Buying from John saves us $15 and avoids further negotiation rounds where there's little chance of success.
* **Time to Move On:** We gave Alice a fair chance.  It's better to walk away now than waste more time and potentially miss out on John's offer."
