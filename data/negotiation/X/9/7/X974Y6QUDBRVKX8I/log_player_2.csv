Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $9,600 is still too high compared to what you're willing to pay. You have 9 more rounds to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This is a strong starting point, offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price while still staying within your budget. This shows Alice you are serious about buying but also that you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high. While it is lower than her first offer, it's still above your budget. You can continue to negotiate and try to get a better price. Remember, you still have 7 more rounds to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800} 
```

You're showing flexibility by increasing your offer slightly, but you're still holding firm on your goal of getting the price closer to your maximum.  This counteroffer demonstrates your commitment to negotiating while also setting a clear limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but it's still not within your desired range.  With only 5 rounds left, it's likely she won't budge much further. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price. You've shown persistence in negotiating, but it's time to take the guaranteed deal."
