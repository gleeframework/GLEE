"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You have a significant buffer before reaching your maximum price ($1,500,000), so it's worth negotiating further to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to profit from the transaction.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is simply too low for me. I understand the product's value to you is high, but I also need to ensure a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is a fair compromise, allowing both of us to gain from this transaction. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what you're comfortable paying. You have room to negotiate further. You're still better off trying to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair return, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm confident that $1,000,000 is a fair price for both of us,  allowing you to profit and me to get a good deal.  Let's finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  While $1000000 is a good offer, it's still slightly below my desired price.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a small compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is close to your counteroffer of $1,000,000.  You have already rejected two offers from Alice, and she may not be willing to budge further.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid the risk of her getting more stubborn and potentially losing the opportunity to buy the product at a reasonable price.  You still have significant savings compared to buying from John at $1,500,000."
