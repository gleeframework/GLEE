Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm asking for $1,400,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate up if he's very interested. It's unlikely he'll accept immediately at this price, but it opens the door for a counter-offer.
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** Offering it too close to $1,500,000 risks Bob outright rejecting it and going with a competitor. Offering it too low leaves potential profit on the table.

This strategy aims to find the sweet spot between a price Bob might consider while still maximizing potential profit for me."
