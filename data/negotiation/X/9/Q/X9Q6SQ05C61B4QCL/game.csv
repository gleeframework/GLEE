"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I need you to meet me a little more. How about $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,750 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
