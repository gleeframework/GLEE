"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. My asking price is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $10,000 is significantly higher than your minimum price of $8,000, allowing for potential concessions if needed.
* **Is within Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so $10,000 is within his range of what he's willing to pay.
* **Is a strong opening offer:**  It shows confidence in the product's value and sets a high bar for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,500 is better than selling to John, we still have room for negotiation.  It's worth rejecting this offer and trying to get closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I need you to meet me a little more. How about $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to our desired price, we're still in a strong negotiating position. We've already made concessions, and $8,750 is still within our acceptable range.  Rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and could lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,750 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting pretty close. I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,875? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,875 is very close to our desired price and only $125 away from our previous counteroffer.  We've already conceded quite a bit, and with only 4 rounds remaining, it's better to accept this offer and secure the sale."
