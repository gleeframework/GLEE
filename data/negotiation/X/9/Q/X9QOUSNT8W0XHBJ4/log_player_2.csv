"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you the product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  While $110 is better than $120 from John, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a little less. Would you be willing to do $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really like the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You should accept Alice's offer. $105 is a good price, and better than what John is offering.  It is likely you won't be able to get a lower price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
