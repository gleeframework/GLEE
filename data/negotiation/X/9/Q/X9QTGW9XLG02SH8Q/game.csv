"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and while my absolute minimum price is $1,500,000, I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our two offers. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we are getting closer.  While $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1,150,000 if that works for you.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my asking price.  To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'll come down to $1,325,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $1,325,000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be open to considering $1,200,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000, but I need to be transparent â€“ this is my final offer. I believe it's more than fair and reflects the true value of this product. Let me know your decision.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1,225,000 for the product. If you're unable to accept that, I understand, but I'm also mindful of other options available to me.",1225000.0,Bob,8,
