"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $18,000.  This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price.  Bob is likely to counteroffer, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's worth trying to get closer to my target price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is still a fair distance from Bob's offer, but it's a significant step down from my initial offer. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. It's worth a couple more rounds to see if we can bridge the gap.  I'll counteroffer again and hope Bob will come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to offer $14,500. This is a small reduction from my previous offer, signaling that I'm serious about making a deal but still prioritizing getting a good price.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to make a final counteroffer that's closer to my minimum."
