"I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $11,250. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,250 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,900. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to both walk away happy.  What do you say?",10900.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,250, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and priority customer support. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product with added peace of mind. I'm still selling it to you for $11,250.",11250.0,Alice,7,
