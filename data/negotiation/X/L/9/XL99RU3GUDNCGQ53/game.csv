"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair price to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. Let's try $11,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'd be willing to do $11,200.  Does that work for you?",11200.0,Bob,6,
