Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $22,000."", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message doesn't explicitly mention Bob's perceived value but focuses on potential benefits, aiming to create a sense of value greater than $8,000 in his mind.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This offer opens the door for Bob to counter-offer.  If Bob rejects this initial high price, you can gradually reduce it during negotiation, aiming to settle somewhere above your $15,000 minimum. 
 
**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have some time for negotiation. If you need to sell quickly, you might offer a price closer to $15,000 to ensure a faster sale."
