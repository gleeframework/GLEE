"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  The value of this product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident it's worth more than $700000. How about we meet in the middle at $850000? It's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you think the product is exceptional, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $750000, but that's as high as I can go.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not convinced that $750000 accurately reflects the true value of this product.  To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to drop my price to $800000. This is my final offer - I'm confident it's a great deal for you, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $800000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $800000, which would be $775000. That's my final offer.",775000.0,Bob,6,
