Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to offer $700000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $700,000 is better than my floor price, I believe I can do better. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  The value of this product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident it's worth more than $700,000. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is exceptional, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $750000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $750,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out hope for a higher offer.  It's worth risking another round to see if I can push Bob a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not convinced that $750,000 accurately reflects the true value of this product.  To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to drop my price to $800,000. This is my final offer - I'm confident it's a great deal for you, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $800000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $800000, which would be $775000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. While Bob's offer of $775,000 is tempting, I've already reached my compromise point and am not comfortable going any lower. John's offer provides a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum price requirement. There's no need to risk further negotiation with Bob."
