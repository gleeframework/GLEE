"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That price is a little high for me though.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $100 is the very most I can afford to spend on this.  Would that work for you?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $120. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",120.0,Alice,5,
