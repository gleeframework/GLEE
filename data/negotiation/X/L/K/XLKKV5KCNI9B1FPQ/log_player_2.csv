"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to pass up. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I was looking for. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $625,000?  That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 625000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I think $700,000 is the lowest I can go. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you coming down on the price. To make this work for both of us, how about we settle at $660,000? This represents a significant savings for me while still being a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 660000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $680,000 is my final offer. This is already a great deal for you, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and while there's a chance to push further, it's getting risky. Accepting at $680,000 secures a $320,000 saving compared to John's offer and avoids potentially overplaying our hand and losing the deal entirely."
