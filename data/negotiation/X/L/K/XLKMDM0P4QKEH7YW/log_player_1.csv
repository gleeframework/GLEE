{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're already getting more than your minimum $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is still getting a good deal, as it's below his perceived value of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This offer allows for some back and forth, giving you a chance to increase the price if Bob is willing to pay more. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a little bit more.  You can make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,600?  I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable solution that's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 8600} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about $8600, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $8300? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,300 is a decent compromise. While it's still a little lower than you'd like, it's significantly higher than what John is offering, and you're still getting more than your minimum.  It's time to accept and secure the sale!"
