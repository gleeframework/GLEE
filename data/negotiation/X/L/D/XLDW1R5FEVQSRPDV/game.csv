"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to both of us, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your business. My starting price is $900,000. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this is a fair price considering its value.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure $900,000 is a fair price for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget constraints.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to be compensated for the value this product brings. How about we split the difference and settle on $825,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential benefits.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing it. Can you consider this offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $775,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my original asking price.  Let's try $800,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this mutually beneficial transaction.",800000.0,Alice,5,
