Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your guaranteed minimum:**  You're aiming for a substantial profit, but not risking too much by setting the price too high.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob a clear incentive to negotiate, potentially allowing you to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for some give and take during the negotiation process. 

While you can't guarantee Bob will accept, this offer provides a strong starting point for a potentially successful negotiation."
