"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a strong offer that leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially secure a higher final price.
* **Understanding Value:** I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so my initial offer is below his perceived value but well above my minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $1,150,000, I signal that I'm open to negotiation while still aiming for a price that's highly profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below his perceived value of $1,200,000. I have room to negotiate and try to secure a better price. Selling to John at this point would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm confident in the value this product holds, particularly for your specific needs. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Hold Firm:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's price, but I'm not conceding too much too quickly. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer aims to anchor the negotiation around the $1,125,000 mark. It leaves room for further negotiation while still keeping the price significantly above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Maintaining Confidence:** My message reiterates the value proposition for Bob, reminding him of the product's worth to him specifically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $1,125,000 is a bit too high. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,075,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now negotiating more aggressively, but his offer is getting close to my absolute minimum. While I want to maximize profit, I also need to be aware of the risk of Bob walking away.  I'll reject this offer to signal I'm not willing to go that low and see if he's willing to move closer to my range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find an agreement that works for both of us. To show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,110,000. I believe this is a fair and final offer considering the product's unique value."", 
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying Flexibility:** I'm making another concession, but this time a smaller one, signaling that I'm reaching the limit of my flexibility.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By framing it as a ""fair and final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to make a decision.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's unique value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits he'd miss if the deal falls through. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still a substantial profit above my minimum and allows one more round for potential negotiation if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,110,000. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,080,000. I believe this is the best price we can both agree on, considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Limit:** Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I could push for more, the risk of him walking away increases significantly.
* **Time Constraint:** We are past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds.  Continuing to push for a small increase isn't worth the risk of losing Bob entirely, especially when I have a guaranteed offer from John.
* **Good Profit:** $1,080,000 is still a significant profit, and securing the deal now provides certainty and avoids a protracted negotiation."
