"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm confident in the value this product holds, particularly for your specific needs. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $1,125,000 is a bit too high. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,075,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find an agreement that works for both of us. To show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,110,000. I believe this is a fair and final offer considering the product's unique value.",1110000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,110,000. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,080,000. I believe this is the best price we can both agree on, considering the product's worth to me.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
