"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer!  $108 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
