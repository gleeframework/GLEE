Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108

I'm still aiming for a higher price. While $108 is closer to my minimum, I can try to push for a little more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer!  $108 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away, but I still think we can meet in the middle. Would you be willing to do $109? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $109 is still below my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. It's better to secure a deal with Bob than risk losing him and ending up with nothing in the end."
