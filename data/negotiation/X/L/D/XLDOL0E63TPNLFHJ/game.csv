"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our needs, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product to both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $875,000, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer.  I believe this represents a good balance between our needs, and I'm hopeful we can finalize a deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $925,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you the product for $912,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",912500.0,Alice,5,
