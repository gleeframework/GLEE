"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000.
* It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price, especially since you have a backup option with John. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counteroffer process, potentially leading to a more favorable price."
