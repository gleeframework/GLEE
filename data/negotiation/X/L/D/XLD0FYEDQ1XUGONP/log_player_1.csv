Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since I know Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with a price higher than that allows room for negotiation. Offering it at $10,000 gives Bob a chance to haggle, potentially settling on a price higher than $8,000 but lower than my initial offer.  If he rejects it, I can always fall back on selling it to John for my minimum acceptable price."
