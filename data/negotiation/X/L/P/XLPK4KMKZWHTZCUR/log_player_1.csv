{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value, which might encourage Bob to accept. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter-offer based on his response.  Remember, I can always sell to John for $10,000, so I have a safety net in case the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell the product for less than $9,000. I'll counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make a profit on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $8500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell for less than $9,000.  I'll counter-offer again to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
