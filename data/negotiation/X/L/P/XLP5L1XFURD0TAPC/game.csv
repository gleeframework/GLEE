I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.
