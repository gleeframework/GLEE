"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",8800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,200. This is a great price for both of us, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that $9,200 is a better offer from you, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Bob,4,
