Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point, as it's a fair price considering the product is worth $150 to him and $120 to me.  I'm confident Bob will accept this offer, but I'm open to negotiation if he wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum price of $120 and it's likely that he will not go any lower. Accepting his offer is the best option to maximize my profit."
