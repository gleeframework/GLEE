Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. Even though Bob is getting closer with his offers, I'm not confident I can get a better price from him.  John's offer is a guaranteed sale and is only slightly below my ideal price."
