Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $100. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering the product at $100 starts the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value ($120) than your minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $100 is a strong starting point, it leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning a ""fair price considering its value,"" you subtly hint at the product's worth without revealing your hand entirely.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
