"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant offer for Bob, as it's significantly less than the product's worth to him, but it also leaves room for negotiation. I want to try to maximize my profit while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, I want to try and get closer to my desired price. I believe I can negotiate a higher price in the following rounds. Selling to John for $800,000 is not an ideal option as I'm aiming for a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,100,000. This is still a significant discount for Bob, but it moves us closer to my desired range. I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can negotiate a better price. I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I believe there's still potential to get a better deal with Bob.  I'll try to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still a good deal for him considering the product's worth to him. I'm hoping that by gradually raising the price, we can reach a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can negotiate a better price. I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I believe there's still potential to get a better deal with Bob. I'll try to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,000,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer.  With only a few rounds left, I need to be more flexible while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is only slightly above my minimum, it's the best offer I've received so far, and with only a few rounds left, it's risky to continue negotiating. If Bob rejects my next offer, I might end up having to sell to John for $800,000.  Accepting this offer guarantees a decent profit."
