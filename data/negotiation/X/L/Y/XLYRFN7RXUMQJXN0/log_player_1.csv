"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum value, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $160 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $180. This is still above my minimum value and hopefully shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to drop my price too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $170 is closer to my desired price and significantly more than selling to John.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
