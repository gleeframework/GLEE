"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1350000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and still reflects the product's worth to me.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1250000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1250000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1300000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
