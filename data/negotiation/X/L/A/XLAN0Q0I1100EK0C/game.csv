"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $125. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $140.  While it's closer to my desired price, I can't go that low yet.  Let's meet in the middle at $150. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,5,
