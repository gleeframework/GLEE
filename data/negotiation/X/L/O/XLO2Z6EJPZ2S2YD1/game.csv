"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the market value, this product offers unique advantages that justify a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,800,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise while acknowledging the true value of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
