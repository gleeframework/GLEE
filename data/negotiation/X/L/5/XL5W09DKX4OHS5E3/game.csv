"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $875000. Would you be willing to consider that?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $875000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850000. Can you consider that?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about this product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $862500, which is right in the middle of our previous offers. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",862500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $862500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $845000. Can you meet me at that price?",845000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $845000, but I need to make a bit more profit. I can do $847500. That's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",847500.0,Alice,7,
