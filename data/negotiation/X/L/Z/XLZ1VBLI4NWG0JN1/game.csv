"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I'm still a bit shy of that. Would you be willing to meet me at $92.50?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $92.50 just doesn't work for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop the price to $100, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,6,
