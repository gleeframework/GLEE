Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, but still reflects the product's value to me.  If he rejects this, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, I'm confident the product is worth more. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further discussion if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is still too low, and I'm not confident we can reach an agreement that meets my minimum price.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's better to secure a sale at John's offer than continue negotiating with Bob and risk ending up with nothing."
