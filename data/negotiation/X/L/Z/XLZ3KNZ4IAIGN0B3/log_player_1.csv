Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, potentially worth at least $1,000,000. To streamline this deal and ensure you receive it quickly, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000.  Let me know your decision, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  While the product's value to Bob is $1,000,000, there's no harm in aiming higher. A significantly higher initial offer allows room for negotiation and still ensures a substantial profit if accepted.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** The presence of a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net. This empowers Alice to be bolder in her initial offer to Bob. 
* **Exclusive Opportunity:** By framing the offer as exclusive and emphasizing the product's value, Bob might be more inclined to accept a higher price. The mention of ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's guaranteed purchase. If Bob knew about John, this offer would be less effective.
* Negotiation is expected. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice should be prepared to potentially lower the price. However, the initial high offer sets a strong starting point for negotiations."
