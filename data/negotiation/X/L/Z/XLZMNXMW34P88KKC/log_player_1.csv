Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation room:**  This leaves room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $80. 
* **Positive framing:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value for Bob.

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I maximize my potential earnings. If Bob rejects, I can then gauge his interest and either lower the price or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $70 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and even lower than the $80 Bob values the product at. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.  There's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to give up too much too early.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range. This allows me to potentially secure a more profitable sale without having to immediately turn to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $70 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $80. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering $90, which is halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $70.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm emphasizing the value for Bob and trying to build a sense of compromise.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it shows a willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a deal that's favorable to both of us. By offering a compromise, I'm increasing the likelihood that Bob will accept and we can finalize the sale. If he rejects, I can still turn to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from the $80 mark. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $85 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of losing Bob:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a good chance he'll walk away, and I might end up selling to John for the same price.
* **Time factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could take time and energy, especially if Bob is firm on his price.

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a sale at a price that's reasonably close to my minimum. This minimizes the risk of losing Bob and allows me to move on without further negotiation."
