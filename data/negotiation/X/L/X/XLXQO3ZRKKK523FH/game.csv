"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm prepared to offer $850000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while still being within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800000, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1100000, but it's still a little outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go to $900000 for the product. This is a good price for both of us, as it allows me to stay within my budget and gives you a decent return on your investment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a good price for you, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800000, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $900000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'll unfortunately have to move on to another seller.",900000.0,Bob,6,
