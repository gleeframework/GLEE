# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her value of the product, it's still above your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still within your budget, and it's closer to your desired price than her previous offer.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will reject your next counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. It's safer to accept this offer and secure the product within your budget."
