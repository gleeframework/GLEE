"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm ready to offer you $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're willing to go that low.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
