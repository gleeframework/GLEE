"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a price that I think is a great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $18,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget than $18,000, it's still above his maximum. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. There are 7 more rounds to go, so there's time to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  Let's try $9,500. This represents a significant reduction from your initial offer and is closer to what I can afford."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $9,500, which would be $10,750. Let's see if we can meet at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,750 is getting closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He has several more rounds to negotiate and could potentially get a better deal.  There's no immediate need to rush into a decision, as he has the option of buying from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate your willingness to come down, $10,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and is a fair price considering our ongoing negotiation."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, $9,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $11,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice is coming down in price, $11,000 is still too high for Bob. He has several more rounds to negotiate and could potentially get a better deal.  There's no immediate need to rush into a decision, as he has the option of buying from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,750,  which is a fair price given the ongoing negotiations. Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $9,750 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $9,750, which would be $10,375. Let's see if we can meet at this price. I'm getting close to my minimum, and I'm willing to make one more concession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still unwilling to go below $10,000, and this is the final round.  Bob has already rejected several offers above his $8,000 budget.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $8,000, saving a significant amount of money and ensuring a deal.  While there is a chance Alice might accept a counteroffer, it's a risky gamble with limited potential reward."
