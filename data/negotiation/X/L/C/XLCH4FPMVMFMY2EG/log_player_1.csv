This offer sets a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum value ($15,000) but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I'd like to see if I can get a bit closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my original asking price, but I'm still hoping for a fair deal.  $18,000 feels like a good compromise, and I'm confident that this will be more appealing to Bob than John's offer."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
