"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm asking for $950,000.  I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal. He should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still providing you a significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is closer to his target, he can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to come down slightly to $887,500. This is my final offer. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is within Bob's budget and a good compromise. While Bob could potentially negotiate a bit lower, the risk of further negotiation might lead to Alice rejecting future offers and potentially forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. It's a good time to close the deal and secure a good price."
