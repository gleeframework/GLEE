"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I have to make a living too! I can do $11,500 for now, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not meeting in the middle, but rather just meeting in the middle of your price range. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my original price. How about we try $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm trying to be fair here.  To be honest, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $12,000.  I'm willing to pay a bit more to work with you, but $11,250 is the absolute highest I can go.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm glad you're willing to pay a premium to work with me. However, I've already compromised quite a bit from my original price. I can do $11,750, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",11750.0,Alice,7,
