"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is the same as John's, there's room for negotiation. Alice values the product at $12,000, meaning she might be willing to go lower to make a sale. By rejecting this initial offer, Bob opens the door to potentially getting a better price without risking exceeding his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower offer ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation while still being within a reasonable range. This counteroffer tests Alice's willingness to lower the price and gives Bob leverage for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I have to make a living too! I can do $11,500 for now, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled that she's willing to negotiate by coming down in price, but her current offer is still above John's price.  Bob has room to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $11,000 without risking exceeding his budget or losing the deal to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Alice's price while still pursuing a significant discount.
* **Psychological Price Point:** $11,000 is a strong psychological price point, often perceived as significantly more appealing than prices slightly higher.
* **Safety Net:**  Bob remains below his budget and John's offer, maintaining a safety net if Alice rejects the counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not meeting in the middle, but rather just meeting in the middle of your price range. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my original price. How about we try $11,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor the negotiation closer to her original price. While $11,750 is a smaller concession, it's still above John's offer.  Bob has leverage as he can always go to John. By rejecting this offer, Bob indicates he's serious about a price closer to $11,000 and is willing to risk the deal to achieve it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I'm trying to be fair here.  To be honest, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $12,000.  I'm willing to pay a bit more to work with you, but $11,250 is the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 11250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:** Bob needs to demonstrate that he's serious and won't budge much further. By revealing John's offer, he sets a firm limit, signaling a strong negotiating position. 
* **Slight Concession:** Offering $11,250 is a small concession, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway between her last offer and his previous counteroffer.
* **Finality:** The language (""absolute highest I can go"") emphasizes this is his final offer, encouraging Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm glad you're willing to pay a premium to work with me. However, I've already compromised quite a bit from my original price. I can do $11,750, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $11,750, indicating she's unlikely to go lower. At this point, accepting her offer would mean paying more than John's price. Bob has reached the limit of his negotiation leverage, and continuing to haggle would be unproductive.  It's time to walk away and take advantage of John's offer, ensuring he gets the product at the best possible price."
