Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $700,000 is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and try to get closer to $800,000."
