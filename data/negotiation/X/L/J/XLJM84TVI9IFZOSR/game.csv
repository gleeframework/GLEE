"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer.  To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point, but I value our conversation and believe you'd be a great owner for this product. Would you consider $800,000? This is my final offer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
