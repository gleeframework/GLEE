(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget. This is a strong opening counteroffer, showing Alice I'm serious about buying, but also setting a clear limit. It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my maximum budget. There's still room for negotiation. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  This is a middle ground between my maximum budget and Alice's previous offer.  I'm hoping this will incentivize Alice to accept, as it's a significant discount from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still $50,000 above my maximum. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John.  There's still a chance we can reach a deal that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to make a final counteroffer, splitting the difference between my last offer and Alice's current offer.  This shows Alice I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I'm also sticking to my budget. If she rejects this, I'll buy from John."
