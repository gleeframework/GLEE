"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This will likely be rejected by Bob, but it sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see if there's room for compromise. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could accept it and make some money, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet either, as I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000, which is still a good profit for me.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to Bob, and it keeps the deal moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm continuing to compromise with Bob, but I'm also trying to get as close to my desired price as possible. $950,000 is a fair compromise that shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to sell for closer to $1,000,000, Bob's offer of $925,000 is a reasonable price, and we're getting close to the end of our rounds.  It's a good profit for me, and it's likely we won't be able to close the deal at a higher price with the remaining rounds.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
