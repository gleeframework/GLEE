"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000 for the product. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me while still offering you a decent profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500 for the product. This price still reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price considering its value to both of us. I believe this is a good compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $10,000 for the product. This is the maximum price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
