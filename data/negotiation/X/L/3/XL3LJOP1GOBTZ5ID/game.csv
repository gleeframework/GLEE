"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. Would you like to make an offer on this product?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $120 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $80? I'm really hoping to get a good deal.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. However, I'm open to further negotiation if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $90? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $92, which is closer to my minimum price. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm excited about the possibility of selling the product to you.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really close to my budget with $92.  If you're willing to come down just a bit more to $90, I'd be happy to finalize the deal right now.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you $92, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think $90 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to give you a slight concession. How about we meet at $91? That's the best I can do.",91.0,Alice,7,
