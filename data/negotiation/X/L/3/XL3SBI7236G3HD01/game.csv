"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'd be willing to pay $850000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm happy to go up to $900000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $975000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so let's meet at $975000 and finalize the deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
