"Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire the product for a significant discount while still ensuring I get a fair price. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,1,
