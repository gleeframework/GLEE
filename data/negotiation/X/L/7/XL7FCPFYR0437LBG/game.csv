"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be useful, but the price is a bit high for me. Could we settle around $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I value your business, $850,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me at this point. Let's compromise: I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still reflects the product's value, and allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement.  Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
