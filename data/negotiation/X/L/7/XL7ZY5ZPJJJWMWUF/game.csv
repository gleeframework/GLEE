"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset that's worth at least that much to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit to find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm interested in your product, and I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good return while I can stay within my budget. ",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is significantly lower than the value I place on this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? This price is still a fair reflection of the product's value, and it gives us both room to negotiate further if necessary.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $975,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I believe we can finalize the deal quickly.  What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to move a bit closer to my valuation, which is good. However, $975,000 is still slightly below what I need. Let's bridge the gap with $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us to finalize the deal quickly. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
