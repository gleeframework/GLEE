{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset that's worth at least that much to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm interested in your product, and I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good return while I can stay within my budget.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy he's interested, his offer is too low. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is significantly lower than the value I place on this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? This price is still a fair reflection of the product's value, and it gives us both room to negotiate further if necessary."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $975,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I believe we can finalize the deal quickly.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to move a bit closer to my valuation, which is good. However, $975,000 is still slightly below what I need. Let's bridge the gap with $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us to finalize the deal quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
