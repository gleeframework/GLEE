Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're getting closer, but $17,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $16,750.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.  Let's seal the deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer of $16,750.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and a good deal considering the product's value to Bob.  It's getting late in the negotiation process and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
