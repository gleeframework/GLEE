"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay $2,000,000. Considering the product's value to me is capped at $800,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price given the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still significantly below my bottom line.  This product has substantial long-term value that I believe you'll benefit from. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $1,750,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'm making a new counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
