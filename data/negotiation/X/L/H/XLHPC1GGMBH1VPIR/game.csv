"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This price is still fair, considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $11,250. I'm confident this price is fair, considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, but I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500. Would that work for you?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $10,500 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go down to $11,000.  This is a significant concession, and I hope you'll consider it. We're both close to reaching an agreement.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,7,
