{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible to maximize my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring a substantial profit for me.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While I could start higher, asking for a price too close to Bob's maximum ($15,000) might make him feel like I'm trying to take advantage, potentially pushing him away. 
* **Secure a Deal:**  This offer strikes a balance between aiming high and ensuring Bob finds the price attractive enough to accept, avoiding the need to sell to John at a lower price."
