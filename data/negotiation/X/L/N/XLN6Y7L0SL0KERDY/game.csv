"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $2,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,750,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential ROI. Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your position, the product's value is truly significant.  I could come down to $2,100,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and allows you to reap the substantial benefits this product offers.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, which is a significant step closer to your offer and reflects the value I see in the product. I hope this compromise works for you.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
