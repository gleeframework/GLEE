Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in this product, but I'd be happy to pay $150 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $150 is exactly the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll choose to sell the product to Bob.
