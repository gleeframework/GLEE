"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this point. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me. This product is really valuable, and I think a fair price would be closer to $13,500. It's a small concession on my end, but I'm hoping we can find a good middle ground. ",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  While $10,500 is tempting, I have to be firm on my end. I can go down to $12,500.  This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers interested.",12500.0,Alice,5,
