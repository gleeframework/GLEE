"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm aiming to sell it for $15,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me. This product is really valuable, and I think a fair price would be closer to $13,500. It's a small concession on my end, but I'm hoping we can find a good middle ground.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $13,500 is closer to your budget, it's still above your $8,000 limit. Continue negotiating to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  While $10,500 is tempting, I have to be firm on my end. I can go down to $12,500.  This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is still too high with her offer. You're getting closer but it's not worth risking going any further with her.  Buying from John at $8,000 is the best option at this point to stay within your budget."
