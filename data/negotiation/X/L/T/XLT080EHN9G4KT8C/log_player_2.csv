# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is a lower price than her initial offer, he can still get the product from John for $1,000,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,175,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still not quite low enough for Bob to want to accept.  Since Bob can get the product from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to buy it from John and avoid any further negotiation with Alice.  Bob has saved himself $175,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
