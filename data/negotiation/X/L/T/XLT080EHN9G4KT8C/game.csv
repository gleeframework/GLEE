"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
