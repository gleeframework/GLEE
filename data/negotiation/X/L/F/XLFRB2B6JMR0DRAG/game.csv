"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $1200000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1050000? This price still reflects the value this product brings to your business, and it allows us both to find common ground.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1000000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows us to finalize this transaction. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to come down, Alice, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and my budget. I'm getting close to my limit, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",920000.0,Bob,6,
