"Hi Alice, I appreciate your time and consideration. However, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $10,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if you're open to negotiations.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is my final offer.  Let's make a deal!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
