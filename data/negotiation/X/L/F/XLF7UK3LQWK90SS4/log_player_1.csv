"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this unique product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than our minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can subtly influence Bob's perception.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting high, we signal that we're open to negotiation but also value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. This reflects its value to me and is a fair price considering the potential we both see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** Bob's counteroffer is closer to his perceived value but still significantly below our minimum. There's room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:** We have the security of John's offer, which gives us leverage. We don't have to accept a price far below our minimum. 

**Next Step (Round 3 -  Your Turn):**  We'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap and move closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. However, $1,200,000 undervalues the unique aspects and potential of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and consider $1,300,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We acknowledge Bob's offer but stand firm on the product's value. ""Final offer"" adds weight and encourages a decision.
* **Strategic Concession:** Meeting halfway shows flexibility but also sets a clear boundary. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to the end of our negotiation rounds, making a firm stance more impactful. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** We secure a price significantly higher than his initial offer.
* **Bob counters:** We'll need to decide whether to negotiate further or take John's offer.
* **Bob walks away:** We still have John's offer as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of this product, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This offer is fair, considering the potential of the product and my budget constraints. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** While we could push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer is now reasonably close to our $1,300,000 ""final offer.""  The potential gain from further negotiation is small compared to the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Each round represents time and potential opportunity cost. Closing the deal now provides immediate value.
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting shows flexibility and could lead to a positive future relationship with Bob.

**Overall, accepting $1,250,000 provides a good balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal in a timely manner.**"
