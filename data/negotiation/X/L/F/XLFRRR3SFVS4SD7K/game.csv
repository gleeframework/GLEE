"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000. This is my top price, and I'm confident it's a fair value considering the market. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $12,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing some movement towards a deal, but $12,000 remains quite low for what I'm offering. Let's settle this at $16,000, it's my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $16,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's try $14,000.  This is a significant step closer to your last offer and a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
