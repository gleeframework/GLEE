Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident you'll see its worth."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000. This is my top price, and I'm confident it's a fair value considering the market. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $12,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing some movement towards a deal, but $12,000 remains quite low for what I'm offering. Let's settle this at $16,000, it's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $16,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's try $14,000.  This is a significant step closer to your last offer and a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:  While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $15,000 mark I need. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation rounds."
