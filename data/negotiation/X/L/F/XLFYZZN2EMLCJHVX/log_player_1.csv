Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which I have another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts:
    * You gain $300,000 more than selling to John.
    * Bob saves $100,000 on a product valued at $800,000 to him.
* **Deadline:**  Adding a deadline creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision.

**Important Note:** This offer assumes you have time to negotiate with Bob before committing to John's offer. If the deadline with John is very tight, you might need to adjust your strategy."
