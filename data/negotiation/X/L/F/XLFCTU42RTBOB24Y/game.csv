"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
