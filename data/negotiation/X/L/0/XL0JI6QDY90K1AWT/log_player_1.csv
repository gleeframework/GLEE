Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on this counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While I understand your perspective on the value, my assessment of the product's potential and uniqueness in the market leads me to place its value significantly higher.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and for your revised proposal. I understand that you believe the product is worth a significant amount, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth the $1,750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account both our perspectives. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly above his initial offer and a good deal closer to my walk-away price. It makes sense to accept this offer now and secure a substantial profit, rather than risk the deal falling through or leaving money on the table by going back and forth."
