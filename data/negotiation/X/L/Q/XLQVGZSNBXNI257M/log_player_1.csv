{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point, and it's possible Bob might be willing to pay a bit more to get the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to pay a bit more than I initially offered, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum threshold of $150.  While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low.  John is a guaranteed sale at $150, so that's the best option for me right now."
