"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's an even greater value to you. I'm starting with an offer of $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000?  Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm open to negotiation, but $950,000 is still too far below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm firm on staying above $1,000,000. How about $1,025,000?  This is a significant compromise, and I'm hopeful we can find a solution.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
