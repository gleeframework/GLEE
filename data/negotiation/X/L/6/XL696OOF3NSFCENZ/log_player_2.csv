# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and unique features, it's valued at $12,000 by us. Considering its worth to you is $8,000, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. Would you be interested in discussing a price that reflects both our perspectives? We're open to negotiation to ensure you receive a product that meets your needs and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's better to reject her offer and purchase from John for $8,000, saving you $2,000."
