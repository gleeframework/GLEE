"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if a better deal can be reached before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob is offering a price that's halfway between his maximum budget and Alice's last offer. This shows he's serious about buying the product but is still trying to get a good price.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and straightforward, emphasizing Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Counteroffer:** This offer is still below Alice's worth but allows for some negotiation room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $10,800. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still slightly above his maximum price. Bob should try to negotiate further and see if he can get Alice to lower the price even more. There's still potential to save a little more before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a little hesitant at $10,800.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,600? I'm sure we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** Bob is showing continued engagement and willingness to compromise.
* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal a desire to reach a deal.
* **Positive Message:**  The message remains friendly, highlighting the shared goal of finding a solution.
* **Reasonable Counteroffer:** Bob is offering a price that's closer to Alice's offer but still within his budget. This shows he's serious about buying the product while still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $10,700, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still $700 over his maximum.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, at this point, the potential savings are small, and the risk of not reaching an agreement increases.  Buying from John provides a guaranteed price that fits within Bob's budget and avoids further negotiation."
