"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can we meet in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  This is still a great price for the product, and it leaves some room for us to agree. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $14,500 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it shows my commitment to finding a solution. What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $14,000.  I'm feeling a bit more flexible now, and I'm willing to come down to $14,250 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a deal without further negotiation.  Let's close this deal now!",14250.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,750 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet at this price.",13750.0,Bob,8,
