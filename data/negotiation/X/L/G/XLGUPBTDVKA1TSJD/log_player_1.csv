Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate, while still being significantly higher than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial asking price. I hope this will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would have preferred a higher price, accepting his offer is the most sensible choice.  If I reject his offer, I risk losing him as a buyer and only being able to sell to John for the same price."
