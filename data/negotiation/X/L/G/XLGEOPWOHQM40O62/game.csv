"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to save as much money as I can.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,250 is my final offer.  This price is still fair for both of us, and allows you to get a great product at a good value.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $9,250 is a good deal for me, considering the product's worth is only $8,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
