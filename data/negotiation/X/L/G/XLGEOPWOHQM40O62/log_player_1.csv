{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for potential compromise and a good outcome for both of us.  I'm hoping Bob will find this offer attractive and be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to save as much money as I can. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,250 is my final offer.  This price is still fair for both of us, and allows you to get a great product at a good value."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $9,250 is a good deal for me, considering the product's worth is only $8,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and it avoids the risk of further negotiation and potentially having to settle for John's offer."
