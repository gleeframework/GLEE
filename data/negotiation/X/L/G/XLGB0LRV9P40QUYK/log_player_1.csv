Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This is a strong starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $950,000 is well above your minimum of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $950,000 is still less than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,000,000), giving him incentive to accept.
* **It shows confidence:**  A bold opening offer can sometimes be more effective than a timid one, especially if you're confident in the product's value.

Of course, the negotiation could go in various directions from here!  Let's see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell the product for such a low price.  It's better to continue the negotiation and see if we can find a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident it will bring you great value.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $780,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price of $800,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to get a price closer to my minimum before I can seriously consider selling to him.  I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to come closer, but $780,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to go down to $820,000, and I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product for you. If you're truly serious about getting this, let's find a way to bridge this small gap."", ""product_price"": 820000}
