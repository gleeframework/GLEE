``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see if Bob is willing to pay that much!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $100. While it's better than selling to John for $80, I think I can still do better. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm countering with $110. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer and my minimum price. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and we can reach an agreement."
