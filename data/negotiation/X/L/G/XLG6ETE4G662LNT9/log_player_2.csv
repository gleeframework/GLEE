"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering the product for $120. While this is a good price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  By rejecting the offer, you can make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $100 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $120, but it's still within your budget and leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is still within your budget and a good deal. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer again and you might end up paying the full $150 to John. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you get the product for a price you're comfortable with."
