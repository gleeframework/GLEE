Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,000,000. It's a small increase, but it's worth considering the value this product brings to you.

I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1,050,000 again, but this time I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package and a 5-year warranty. This is my final offer.

Bob has already gone through several rounds of negotiation and Alice is still unwilling to budge significantly.  He's already made a counteroffer close to his limit. At this point, the offer from John is the safer option. It's within Bob's budget, and he can avoid further negotiation and potential delays."
