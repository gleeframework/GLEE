Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have a strong position to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a profit above your minimum.
* **Gauge Interest:**  A higher initial offer helps you understand how interested Bob truly is and how much he might be willing to pay. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product's value to Bob ($10,000), he's unlikely to accept an offer significantly higher than that. 
* **Market Conditions:** This strategy assumes you're not in a rush to sell. If you need to sell quickly, a lower offer might be more strategic."
