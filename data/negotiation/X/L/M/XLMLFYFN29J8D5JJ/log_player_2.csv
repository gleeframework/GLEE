"Round 1

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, but $9,000 is still a significant markup from the product's value to Alice ($8,000).
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so rejecting the initial offer gives you time to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering slightly above Alice's value of $8,000. This shows I'm serious about buying but also sets a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Room for compromise:** There's still room for Alice to counter with a price closer to my target while still making a profit. 
* **Time is on our side:**  We have 9 rounds left, which allows for further negotiation if needed."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While she's come down a bit from $9,000, it's still above my target of $12,000.
* **I can still get a better deal.** We have 8 rounds left, and there's a chance Alice will be willing to negotiate further.
* **Buying from John is still an option.**  I'm not desperate, so if Alice won't budge, I can still buy from John for $12,000, but I'd prefer to save money."
