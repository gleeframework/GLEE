"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product,  $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and outlining your position. I see the value you place on the product, but $1,200,000 is too far below its worth.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
