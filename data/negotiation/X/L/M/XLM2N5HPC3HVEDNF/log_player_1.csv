Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product,  $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and outlining your position. I see the value you place on the product, but $1,200,000 is too far below its worth.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is not showing a willingness to meet near the product's actual value. While he increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum and going any lower cuts into my potential profit too much. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, making it the most logical choice at this point."
