"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best option. Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer ($140):** You save $10 compared to buying from John. 
* **John's Offer ($150):** Your maximum budget, but not ideal if you can save money.

Even though you could try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting $140 guarantees you get the product at a reasonable discount."
