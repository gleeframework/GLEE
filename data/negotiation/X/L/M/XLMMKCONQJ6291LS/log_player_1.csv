"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the potential gain.
* **Openness:** I'm inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation process. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. Depending on Bob's response, I will adjust my strategy for subsequent rounds, potentially lowering the price if necessary or choosing to sell to John if the deal with Bob doesn't seem promising."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $9,000. This aligns better with my budget and the perceived value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly below what I'd like to earn. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially as he acknowledged the product's value in his message.
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but I'm not desperate. I'm willing to take a calculated risk to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.

**Next Round Strategy:**

* I will counter with a price between $9,000 and $12,000, focusing on the potential for both of us to find a mutually agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, and I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price still offers you a great deal, considering the value you've stated, and it's closer to my desired price.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  $10,500 represents a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone can help keep the negotiation moving forward. 

**Next Round Strategy:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to further adjust the price based on his response.
* I'll keep a close eye on my remaining rounds and the potential of selling to John. If the deal with Bob stalls, I'll need to decide whether to accept his offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Based on our previous discussions and considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $10,000. This still offers a good deal for me while being closer to my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is just $500 below my previous offer and is only $2,000 below my ideal price. This is a good result, considering the potential risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal.
* **Time Factor:** We are already in round 4, and time is a factor.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to further rounds and potentially a lower price, or a deal with John might become more appealing.
* **Risk of John:** While John's offer is higher, there is no guarantee that the deal with John will be finalized. Selling to Bob secures a sale.

**Conclusion:** 

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer of $10,000 is the most strategic move. It secures a good price within my acceptable range and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
