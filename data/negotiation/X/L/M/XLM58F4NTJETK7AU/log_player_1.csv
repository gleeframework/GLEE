Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I think it's worth $150, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit, but stay within a reasonable range.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above our minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John at $80, so we don't have to settle for less.
* **First Offer Psychology:** Starting with a strong offer can anchor the negotiation in our favor. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the deal."
