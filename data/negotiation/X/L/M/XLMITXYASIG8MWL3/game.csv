,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $80 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's the minimum I'm willing to sell for, and it's still a great deal for you.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Okay Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about $95? That's a fair compromise between our two prices.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $95 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. How about we meet at $110? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
