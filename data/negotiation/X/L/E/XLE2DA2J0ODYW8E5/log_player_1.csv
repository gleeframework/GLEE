Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. I've priced it at $13,000 for a quick sale. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** I know Bob values the product at $15,000, giving me significant room to negotiate above my minimum price ($8,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($13,000) allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting in the middle for a price that's still very profitable for me. 
* **Backup Option:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John if Bob declines. This gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob.
* **""Quick Sale"" Tactic:**  Mentioning a ""quick sale"" might encourage Bob to act fast and accept the offer without much back-and-forth."
