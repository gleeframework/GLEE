"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm confident it's worth a lot to you, and I'm starting with a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe the product is worth more. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial asking price. How about $9,000? This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be very valuable."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8000. Would you be willing to meet me at $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved up from his initial offer of $8,000 to $8,500.  This is getting closer to my desired price range. It's important to consider that I only have 10 rounds to close the deal.  While I would prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is a good compromise that secures a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely.  Additionally, if I were to reject Bob's offer and try for a higher price, there is a chance Bob might walk away, leaving me with only the $8,000 offer from John."
