"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Can we discuss $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference between your offer and mine from the previous round, and settle on $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,250 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. Let's try to find a sweet spot in between. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,250, so how about $10,625?",10625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $10,625 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  To be realistic, the most I can offer is $8,000.  This is a fair offer considering my budget.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is the most you're willing to pay, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I've already met you halfway from $10,625, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,7,
