Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I believe it's a great deal and would be a valuable asset to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still within a range that might be appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing the offer as a good deal.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** My message implies I'm open to negotiation, which might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just a starting point. The optimal strategy will depend on various factors, including the product's actual value to Bob, how desperate I am to sell, and my ability to assess Bob's negotiating style.
* I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John if the negotiation with Bob fails. This serves as a safety net and helps me avoid settling for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $10000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. Since John is also offering the same price, it makes more sense to sell to John right away. This avoids the uncertainty and potential time wasted on further negotiation with Bob."
