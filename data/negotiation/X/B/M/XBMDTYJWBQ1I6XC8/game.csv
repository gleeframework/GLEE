"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $13500. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12500. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13750. This is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13750 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about $13000? That's a good compromise for both of us and allows us to make this deal happen.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $13500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value to me is $12000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
