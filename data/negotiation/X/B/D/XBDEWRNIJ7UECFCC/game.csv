"Hi Alice,  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  I could be flexible, but I can't go as low as $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
