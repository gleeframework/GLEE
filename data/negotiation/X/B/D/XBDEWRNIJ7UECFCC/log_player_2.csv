"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is way above my budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as I might be able to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  I could be flexible, but I can't go as low as $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer of $11,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 9500}
