"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? This price is still within your budget and closer to what I need. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,250 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,750? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $10,000? That's a good compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. It's my final offer, let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,5,
