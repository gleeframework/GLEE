```

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit lower than my minimum but allows for potential negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll see if his counteroffer is reasonable. I'm always prepared to go to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $12,000. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob, but I'll definitely be prepared to sell to John if we can't reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? This price is still within your budget and closer to what I need. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10,250 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,750? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is tempting, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm going to make one more counteroffer to Bob. If he rejects, I'm going to sell to John."
