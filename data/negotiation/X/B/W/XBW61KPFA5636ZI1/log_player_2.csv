"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is a decent price, you can still do better. You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's product is worth $80 to her.  There's room for negotiation to get a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This offer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $100, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $95 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer of $100, and it's still within your budget of $120. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you might end up buying from John at $120."
