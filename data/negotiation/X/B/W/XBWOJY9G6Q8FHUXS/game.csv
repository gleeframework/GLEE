"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let's make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little ways off. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
