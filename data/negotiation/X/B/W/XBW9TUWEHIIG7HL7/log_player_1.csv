{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset that will be worth a lot to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate, but still lower than the product's worth to Bob, leaving him room to feel like he's getting a good deal.  I'll be ready to counter if he rejects, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only justify going as high as $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to go for a quick sale, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $775,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware that John is a solid backup option. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still not quite there for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer the product for $812,500. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable asset.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 812500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're a tough negotiator!  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $790,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is just below my minimum threshold.  Given that John is a guaranteed sale for $800,000, it's the safest and most sensible option."
