"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a better price than John's $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $850000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $900000. This is a fair compromise that still allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's finalise this now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** At $900,000, Alice's offer is still lower than buying from John for $1,000,000.
* **Limited negotiation potential:**  Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise, making further negotiation risky.  There's a chance she might reject another counteroffer, leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John.
* **Value for Bob:**  The price is still within Bob's target range of $1,000,000, and it's a good deal compared to other options.

It's a calculated risk, but accepting Alice's offer ensures a purchase while still saving money compared to John."
