"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price significantly above my minimum. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing specific details, encouraging Bob to engage further. 
* **Alternative:** The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net and allows me to walk away from offers significantly below my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his perceived value. While it's tempting to accept $900,000, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. By rejecting and countering, I demonstrate the value of the product and aim to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 undervalues the product's true potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer it at $1,075,000."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Ground:**  I'm lowering my initial ask by $75,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate. However, my new price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is slightly above the halfway point between my initial offer and Bob's offer,  encouraging him to move closer to my desired range. 
* **Maintain Confidence:**  My message remains positive and highlights the product's benefits, reinforcing the idea that a higher price is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are making progress, but Bob's offer is still too low. While he increased his offer slightly, it remains below my guaranteed sale price to John. It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's bridge the gap â€“ how about $1,025,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value you'll gain from the product."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Seeking Common Ground:** I'm further reducing my price, now by $50,000, demonstrating a commitment to finding a solution. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's benefits, connecting the price to the tangible value Bob will receive. 
* **Strategic Concessions:**  My concessions are becoming smaller, signaling that I'm approaching my limit. This encourages Bob to take larger steps toward my target price. 
* **Time Consideration:**  With half the rounds remaining, maintaining a firm but fair stance keeps the negotiation moving while protecting my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to my safety net price with John. However, I know the product is worth significantly more to Bob. At this stage, showing a willingness to walk away from the deal could push Bob to make a more serious offer.  I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be upfront.  My absolute lowest price for this product is $1,000,000.  I believe it's a fair offer considering the value it will bring you. Let me know if you're able to meet this price."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my bottom line. This approach minimizes further back-and-forth and encourages a quick decision from Bob.
* **Justification:**  I'm not providing further concessions but am reiterating the value proposition to reinforce why my price is justified.
* **Time Pressure:** With the rounds dwindling, conveying urgency might prompt Bob to act before losing the opportunity. 
* **Safety Net:** By matching John's offer, I'm not risking a worse outcome if Bob rejects and I decide to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $990,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price, even after a firm stance and a clear explanation.  Dragging out the negotiation further is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from him. It's time to cut my losses and accept John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000."
