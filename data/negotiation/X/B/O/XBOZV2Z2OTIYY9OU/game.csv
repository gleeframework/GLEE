"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand the value you see in the product, $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still leaves you a significant profit margin and is a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
