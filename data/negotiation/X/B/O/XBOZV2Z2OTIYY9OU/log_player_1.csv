"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer ($1,200,000) that still leaves room for negotiation, but ensures I maximize potential profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer in terms of the value Bob will gain from the product, which can help make it seem more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, indicating my willingness to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value I see in the product and the price you're asking. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Still High:**  While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still lower than the $1,200,000 I initially offered, and I believe there's still room for me to negotiate a better price. 
* **Bob's Motivation:** Bob clearly sees value in the product and is willing to pay a significant amount. I'm confident I can push for a higher price in the next round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but it's much lower than what I can potentially earn from negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand the value you see in the product, $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still leaves you a significant profit margin and is a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer that shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, indicating flexibility, but still leaving significant profit for myself.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is beneficial for both of us, highlighting the profit margin for Bob and the potential for a successful deal. 
* **Openness to Continue:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation to encourage Bob to keep discussing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $1,000,000 for your product. This seems like a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $1,000,000 is very close to my initial counteroffer of $1,050,000, which means I'm likely at the upper end of what I can realistically expect.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Even though it's less than my ideal price, securing a deal with Bob might open up opportunities for future collaborations or sales.  
* **Time Constraint:**  With limited rounds remaining, accepting the offer minimizes the risk of further negotiations leading to a lower price or a failed deal.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $800,000 is guaranteed, it's significantly lower than what Bob is offering."
