Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. What do you think?

This is a good deal for Bob! He's getting the product for $325,000 less than his maximum budget and a significant saving compared to John's offer. Pushing for a lower price might risk Alice walking away, which isn't in Bob's best interest."
