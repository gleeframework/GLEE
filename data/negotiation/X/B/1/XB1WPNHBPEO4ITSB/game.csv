"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value to me.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and it's clear you're serious about acquiring this product.  However,  $10,500 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work for me.  Given the product's value and the potential it offers your business, I'm willing to come down slightly to $11,500.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget while also ensuring I can meet my own financial needs. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm happy to meet you halfway.  $11,500 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product.  This price is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value to both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",11000.0,Bob,4,
