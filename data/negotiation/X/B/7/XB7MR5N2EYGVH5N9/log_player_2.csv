It's not worth paying Alice's asking price.  You can get the same product from John for a lower price.  Rejecting her offer lets you try to negotiate a better price."

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  It shows you're willing to pay a bit more, but still want a price that's closer to your target. It's a good strategy to see if Alice is willing to meet you halfway."
