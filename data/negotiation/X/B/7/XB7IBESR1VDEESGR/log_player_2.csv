"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $750,000. I believe this is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get closer to your target price of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000. I believe this is still a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $725,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one,  it's still above your ideal price point. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if you can get closer to $700,000. There's still room for compromise, and you have several rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $725,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land closer to $710,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can find a way to make it work."", ""product_price"": 710000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $710,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $720,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $720,000, which is very close to your target price of $700,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible, or you'll run out of rounds.  Accepting her offer now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of paying more to John or losing the deal altogether."
