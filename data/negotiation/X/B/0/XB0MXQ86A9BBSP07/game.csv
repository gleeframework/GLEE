"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 just doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a good compromise considering my minimum price.  It's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a fair price. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,5,
