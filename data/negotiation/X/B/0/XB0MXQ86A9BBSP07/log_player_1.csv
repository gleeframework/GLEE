"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the potential value for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $17,000 is a significant discount from my floor price, giving Bob the impression that there's room to negotiate.

I'm aiming to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his initial valuation, potentially based on the product's true worth or a desire to secure it quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While I could sell to John now for $15,000, I still believe there's potential to get closer to my target price with Bob. 
* **Negotiation is key:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I've already established a willingness to compromise and there's a chance he'll increase his offer further.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial offer of $17,000. This shows good faith and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Attractive Price:**  $14,000 is still a significant discount from my minimum price ($15,000), but it's closer to my desired outcome.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal"" for Bob, appealing to his sense of value and potential savings.

I'm aiming to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us and hopefully secure a sale in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. How about $13,000? That's my final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of losing John:**  While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I'm also running the risk of losing John as a potential buyer.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** Bob claims his offer is final, but he might be willing to negotiate further if I push back. 

I'm willing to take a calculated risk and see if I can get Bob to increase his offer to at least $14,000 in the next round.  If not, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 just doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a good compromise considering my minimum price.  It's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a fair price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm making a small concession by lowering my price from $14,000 to $13,500. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing that $13,500 is still a good deal for Bob, considering the product's worth. 
* **Finality:**  While not explicitly stating it's my final offer, the tone suggests that I'm not willing to go lower.

I'm hoping to secure a deal at this price, but if Bob still refuses, I'll likely move on to John to avoid further risk of losing him as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250. That's my final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $13,250 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still below my desired outcome.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag out the process and further increase the chance of losing John as a buyer.
* **Securing a guaranteed sale:** Selling to John now guarantees me a sale at my minimum acceptable price, eliminating the risk and uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.

Given the limited rounds remaining, I'm choosing to minimize risk and secure a guaranteed sale to John, ensuring that I receive at least my minimum desired profit."
