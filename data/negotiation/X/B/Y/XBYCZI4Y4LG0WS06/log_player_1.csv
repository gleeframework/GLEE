"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant amount less than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him room to negotiate. It also allows me to potentially earn more than the $12,000 I would get from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm hoping to get closer to $14,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm offering $13,500.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I believe it's a fair price, still allowing me to make a profit, while also demonstrating my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit over selling to John, and I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away."
