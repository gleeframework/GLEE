# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. It's a unique offering that I believe would significantly enhance your business operations or personal endeavors. Given its exceptional value and the benefits it offers, I am confident it could be a game-changer for you. Considering its true worth and the impact it can have on your endeavors, I propose a price of $12,000 for this product. This offer is tailored to ensure you receive the most benefit while also allowing me to fairly compensate for the investment we've made into developing this product. I look forward to discussing this further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000 and the price John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you are moving closer to your goal of securing the product at the best possible price. You can now proceed to purchase from John."
