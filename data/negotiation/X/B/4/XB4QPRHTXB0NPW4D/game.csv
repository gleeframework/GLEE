"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  Considering the value I'm looking for, I'd be happy to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm still very interested in the product, and I'm prepared to offer $9500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $11000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is a fair price for me and a good deal for you.  It's my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept.",10000.0,Bob,6,
