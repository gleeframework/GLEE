"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at the maximum I'm willing to pay, it's always worth trying to negotiate. There's no downside to rejecting and trying to get a better price.  Even if we end up buying from John, we've gained some experience with the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer of $1,100,000 shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and am not simply accepting her initial price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows for potential concessions from both sides."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, and $1,150,000 is a significant saving compared to both her initial offer and John's price.  Accepting this offer ensures a successful negotiation while still achieving a reasonable price."
