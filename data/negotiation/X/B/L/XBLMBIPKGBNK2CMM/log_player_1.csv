I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  Although I could sell to John for $12,000, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000 with Bob.  There are still 4 rounds left and the potential for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price to see if we can come to an agreement."

Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $12,000.  While I would love to close the deal with Bob, we've gone back and forth several rounds and it seems he's unwilling to come up to a price that's closer to my desired value.  I'm running out of rounds and John is a guaranteed $12,000, so it's the best decision for me at this point."
