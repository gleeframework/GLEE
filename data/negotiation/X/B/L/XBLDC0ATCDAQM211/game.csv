"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference this time.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and provides a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,500, which is a fair compromise. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still below my minimum. Let's meet halfway again - I'm willing to go down to $9,750. This is a fair compromise and will allow us to close the deal quickly. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,7,
