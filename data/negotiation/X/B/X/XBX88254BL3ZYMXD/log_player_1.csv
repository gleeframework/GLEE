Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While it's tempting to take $800,000 from John, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $800,000, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to keep negotiating with him, as I believe I can still get a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $750,000 is still too low for me. Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $825,000.
