I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.  I'm confident that the product is worth more than $1,200,000 to Bob, and I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a premium for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if I could get a decent price,  $1,000,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price.  I will counteroffer and see if we can come to a more reasonable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him, and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is still too low.  I'm not willing to go below my minimum price, and it seems like we're stuck in a negotiation stalemate.  I'm better off selling to John at this point and securing the guaranteed price of $1,200,000."
