"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Opening Price:** I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate and ensures I maximize my profit. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and enthusiastic, hoping to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to make him see the potential for a good deal. 

**Note:** This is just the first round, and I'll be prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response.  I'm also keeping in mind the potential of selling to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  Here's my reasoning:

* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's offer is still below my desired price, and I believe there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** By rejecting his offer and continuing the negotiation, I have the opportunity to potentially get closer to my ideal price of $1,200,000 or even higher.
* **Risk Assessment:**  Selling to John at $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I'm not yet ready to give up on maximizing my profit.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This price still offers you a great value, and it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Flexible:** I'm stating my minimum price point while expressing willingness to compromise. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal but also open to negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product brings to Bob, reminding him it's worth more than what he initially offered. 
* **Middle Ground:**  My counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a middle ground that should be more appealing to Bob than his offer while still ensuring I don't lose too much.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary.  However, I'm also keeping in mind that I can always accept John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not ready to settle just yet. Here's my reasoning:

* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  Selling to John at $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I'm not yet ready to give up on maximizing my profit.  By continuing the negotiation, I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price or at least get a price that's closer to $1,000,000.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. I will be cautious and look for a middle ground solution that keeps the negotiations moving towards a win-win situation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to come up a bit, and I appreciate that. While $950,000 is closer, I'm still at my limit. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This would allow us both to walk away happy with a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between our last offers. This demonstrates my commitment to finding a compromise while still ensuring I meet my minimum goal. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone, emphasizing the win-win aspect of the deal.
* **Finality:**  I'm subtly suggesting that this is my final offer, but without making it an ultimatum.  This adds a sense of urgency while keeping the negotiation open. 

**Note:** I'm now very close to John's offer of $1,000,000. If Bob rejects this offer, I might consider accepting John's offer in the next round to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we try $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

I've reached a point where the negotiation with Bob is getting tedious, and his counteroffers are becoming increasingly less attractive.  

* **Close to John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This means that I'm not likely to get much more from Bob, even if I continue the negotiation.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** The risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a stalemate or even a lower price is high.  
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  Selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable profit and avoids further negotiation.

Therefore, I've decided to accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,000,000. This secures a good deal and allows me to avoid the potential risks and uncertainty of continued negotiation with Bob."
