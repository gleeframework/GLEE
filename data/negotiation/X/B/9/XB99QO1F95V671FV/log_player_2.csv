Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,750 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to you.

It seems we've reached an impasse with Alice.  She's not budging below $11,250, and at this point, it's better to secure the product from John for $12,000. While it's not ideal to pay the full price, it's preferable to continuing a negotiation that might not yield a significantly better outcome."
