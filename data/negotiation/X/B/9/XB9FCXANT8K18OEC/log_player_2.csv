Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a good price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,000,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to me is $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get the price down further.  I'm also starting to get closer to my limit, so I might consider buying from John if this next round doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to me is $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $975,000 is still too high for me. I'm running out of rounds, and I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate will only result in a higher price. Given that John is willing to sell the product for $800,000, which is within my budget, it's the most sensible choice for me to buy from him."
