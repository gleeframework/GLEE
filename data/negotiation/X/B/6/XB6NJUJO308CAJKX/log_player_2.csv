You can do better than $90. It's worth rejecting and seeing if Alice will come down in price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product but $90 is a little higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about we split the difference and I buy it for $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}

Alice is being stubborn, but you can still do better than $92. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we settle on $90, and we can call it a deal?

Alice has come back to $90, which is the same as her initial offer. Since you're willing to pay up to $100 for the product, accepting her offer is the best choice. You'll save $10 compared to buying from John."
