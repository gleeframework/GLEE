# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product at a price that I think is very reasonable considering its worth to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John for $12,000."
