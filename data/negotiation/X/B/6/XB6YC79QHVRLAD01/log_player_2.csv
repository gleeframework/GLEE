"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal is to save money.** $90 is still above Bob's maximum price point of $100. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** This ensures Bob has an alternative if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob wants to save as much as possible.**  A counteroffer of $85 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $90.
* **This offer is still above Alice's value.** Alice values the product at $80, so she has room to negotiate. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point.**  Bob is starting with a lower price while still giving Alice room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is worse than her initial offer.**  $92 is higher than her first offer of $90. This suggests she may be unwilling to negotiate further.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Bob's goal is to save as much as possible, and rejecting gives him the opportunity to try a lower counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is still a backup option.** If negotiations fail, Bob has a guaranteed source for the product at $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob needs to keep lowering the price.** Alice is clearly unwilling to go below $90, so Bob needs to get more aggressive. 
* **This offer is still above Alice's value.** Alice values the product at $80, so she has a little room to negotiate.
* **It's a strong counteroffer.** This signals that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and willing to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget.** $88 is less than Bob's maximum price of $100.
* **There's a good chance Alice won't go lower.** She rejected Bob's last offer of $82, indicating she might not be willing to go below $88. 
* **Risk of losing the deal.**  If Bob keeps rejecting, Alice might get frustrated and walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price."
