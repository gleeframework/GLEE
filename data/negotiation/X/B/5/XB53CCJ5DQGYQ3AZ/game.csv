"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the value of the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but $60 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer you a price of $120. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $120 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we settle on $80? It's a fair deal for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is the minimum you're willing to pay, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I've already come down significantly from my initial offer of $180. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer you a price of $110. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",110.0,Alice,5,
