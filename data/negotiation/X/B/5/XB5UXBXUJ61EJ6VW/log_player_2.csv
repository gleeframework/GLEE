"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $6,500 is a good deal, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down a bit more, especially since she's aiming for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $5,500 is a good distance from her initial offer but still leaves room for compromise.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my maximum of $8,000, but I want to see how much she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than her initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my target price.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I keep pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $6,000.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price lower than her initial offer.  This should put some pressure on her to make a concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,200 is getting closer to my maximum but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  There's still room to negotiate, and I want to try and secure a better deal. I'm going to reject this offer and see if she'll come down further.  If not, I'll consider buying from John, but I want to exhaust all options with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to increase my counteroffer again to $6,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to meet her halfway. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it will be more appealing to Alice. I'm hoping this will be enough to get her to accept, but if not, I'll continue to negotiate in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is getting closer to my maximum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. With only a few rounds remaining, I want to try to squeeze out a slightly better deal. I'm going to reject this offer and make one final counteroffer in the next round. If Alice doesn't accept, I'll consider buying from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going all-in with my final counteroffer of $7,000. It's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows Alice that I'm serious about closing this deal. This is my last chance to get a price lower than John's offer, and I'm hoping that the pressure of the limited rounds and my willingness to meet her halfway will convince her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,800 is only $200 lower than John's price, and we're down to the final round.  The chances of getting a significantly better deal with Alice are slim.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John to ensure I get the product."
