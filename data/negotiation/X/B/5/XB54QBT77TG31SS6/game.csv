"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more in line with your budget.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. I can offer you a compromise at $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise considering our previous offers.",825000.0,Alice,5,
