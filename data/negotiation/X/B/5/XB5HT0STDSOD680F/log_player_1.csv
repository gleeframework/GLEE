Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows for some wiggle room if Bob wants to haggle, but still ensures a significant profit above John's offer.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value makes it more likely he'll accept, while still securing a great deal for Alice."
