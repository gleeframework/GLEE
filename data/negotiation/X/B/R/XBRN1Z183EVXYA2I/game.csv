"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable asset at a price significantly lower than its true worth. I believe this offer is mutually beneficial, allowing you to secure a profitable acquisition while enabling me to realize a substantial portion of the product's value. Let me know your decision, and we can finalize the details. However, please be aware that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000, so time is of the essence.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
