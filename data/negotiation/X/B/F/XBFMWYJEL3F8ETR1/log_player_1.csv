Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find my asking price of $1,150,000 to be fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high but stay below Bob's perceived value.  
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, and starting higher gives you bargaining space.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup allows you to be firm with your offer to Bob.

**The Strategy:**

This offer aims to secure a price significantly higher than your minimum while staying attractive to Bob. It balances risk and reward, recognizing that while you have a backup buyer, maximizing profit from Bob is the primary goal."
