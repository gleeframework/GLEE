"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price, considering its worth to both of us.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
