"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a good price for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,000, which would be $10,500. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Can you meet me at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
