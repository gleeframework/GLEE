(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
