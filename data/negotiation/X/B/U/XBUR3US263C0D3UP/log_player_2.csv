Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but $950000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some extras, such as a warranty and support package, which would normally cost an additional $50000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I think I meant to say I'll reject Alice's offer and consider buying from John, not make a counteroffer. Since I already rejected Alice's offer, I'll send a new counteroffer.
