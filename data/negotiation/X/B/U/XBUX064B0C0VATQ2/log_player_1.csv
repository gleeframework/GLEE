Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Our Minimum:** We need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** John acts as a safety net, ensuring we don't have to go below $100.

By offering the product at $140, we are aiming for a price that is:

* **Attractive to Bob:** It's significantly less than his perceived value.
* **Profitable for us:** It's well above our minimum selling point and maximizes our potential profit. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential of securing a higher profit margin."
