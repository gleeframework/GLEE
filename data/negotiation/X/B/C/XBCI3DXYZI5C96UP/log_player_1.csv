Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above my minimum:** I'm guaranteed to make a profit of at least $5,000.
* **It allows room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I have room to lower the price and still get a good deal.
* **It tests Bob's interest:** If Bob is willing to pay close to $20,000, it means he really values the product.

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  There's a good chance I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $18,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still $3,000 above my minimum. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also value the product and won't sell it for a price too far below my initial estimate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum, and while it's lower than I'd hoped for, it's still a good profit.  I'm not sure how much further I could push the negotiation with Bob.  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
