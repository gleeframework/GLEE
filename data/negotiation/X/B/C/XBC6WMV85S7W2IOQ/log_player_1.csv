Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering it at $15,000 might seem too aggressive and could make Bob walk away, even though it's his maximum valuation.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
