"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a little high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While your offer is lower than I anticipated, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to come down to $850,000. This reflects the substantial value this product can bring to your operations.  Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 still doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope we can reach a final agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that. $825,000 is close, but I'm aiming for a final price of $800,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",800000.0,Bob,6,
