Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a little high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could you consider $700,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $800,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 still doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $825,000.
