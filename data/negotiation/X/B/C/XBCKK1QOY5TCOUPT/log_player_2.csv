"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are looking to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $120, you can likely get a better deal. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a better price than Alice's first offer, it's still above your target of $120. You're better off continuing to negotiate and seeing if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's meet in the middle and seal this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a good compromise. It's higher than your initial counteroffer, showing you're willing to negotiate, but it's still within your budget and leaves room for Alice to potentially accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting close to your target price, Bob. I'm willing to give a bit more. I can offer it to you for $112. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love this product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112 is within your budget and only $2 more than your last counteroffer. It's likely that you won't be able to get a significantly better price, and continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price. It's a good deal for you and allows you to secure the product."
