Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth $10,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $9,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he gets you to come down.
* **Justification:**  Offering a reason for the price, even if it's just perceived value, can make it seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room:** By offering a price of $9,000, there's a good chance Bob might counter-offer, but it's still a significant profit above my minimum. If he rejects it, I can always sell to John for my baseline."
