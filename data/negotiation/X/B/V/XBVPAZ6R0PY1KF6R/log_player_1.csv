Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed backup buyer (John).

**Strategy**

The ideal outcome is to sell to Bob for the highest price he's willing to pay while still ensuring he sees value in the deal.  Since you have a backup offer, you can be a bit more aggressive.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can exceed the $1,100,000 I'm asking. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Creating a sense of scarcity and urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob (""significant value,"" ""exceed"") reminds him of what's at stake. 
* **Strong Price Point:** $1,100,000 leaves you with a significant profit while staying below Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even though it's just John) adds to the urgency.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You have some wiggle room between $1,000,000 and $1,100,000.
* **Confidence:** Project confidence in your offer. You know the product's worth and you have alternatives. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
