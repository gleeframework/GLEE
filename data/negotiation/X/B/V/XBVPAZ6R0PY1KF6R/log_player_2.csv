"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can exceed the $1,100,000 I'm asking. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to create a sense of urgency and implying the product is worth more than your $1,200,000 limit. However, you know you have John as a backup option at $1,200,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you give yourself a chance to:

* **Negotiate:**  Alice might be willing to come down in price, especially if she believes she might lose you as a buyer. 
* **Force her hand:** Her ""other interested parties"" might be a bluff.  Rejecting the offer might make her more willing to accept a lower price.

Even if she doesn't budge, you haven't lost anything by rejecting and going with John."
