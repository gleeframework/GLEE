**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's very unlikely to reach a price point close to what John is offering.  The difference between Bob's latest offer ($980,000) and John's guaranteed price ($1,200,000) is too significant to ignore. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
