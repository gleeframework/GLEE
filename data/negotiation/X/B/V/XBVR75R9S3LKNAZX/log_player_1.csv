Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really like it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is a good compromise between your minimum and Bob's perceived value. It leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures you're not giving away too much value too early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I can come down a bit, but $85 is still a bit low for me. How about $95?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
