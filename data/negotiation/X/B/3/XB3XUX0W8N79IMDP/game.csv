"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  However, $10,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,200. This still gives you a great value for the product, and it's closer to what I need to get. Let me know if this works for you.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to try to get it for $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",11000.0,Bob,4,
