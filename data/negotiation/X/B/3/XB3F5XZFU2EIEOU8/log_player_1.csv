{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair, considering the significant value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation, but also a substantial amount for Bob, making it likely he'll consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still significantly lower than my target price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still offers you a substantial discount from the value you placed on the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is a decent compromise. It's still significantly higher than what John is offering and closer to my target price. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a good deal without risking further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price."
