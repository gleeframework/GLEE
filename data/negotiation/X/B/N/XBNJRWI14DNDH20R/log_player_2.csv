"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate with Alice and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

Bob is going to start with a counteroffer of $12,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. Since Bob knows he can get the product for $12,000 elsewhere, he's aiming to get as close to that price as possible while still keeping the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still get the product from John for $12,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially get the price lower, especially since she's already moved a bit closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob is going to counter with $13,000. This is a compromise between Alice's last offer and his own previous offer. It shows Alice that he is willing to negotiate, but also that he won't be swayed by her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he can get the product from John for $12,000, Alice's offer of $13,200 is still a good deal.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and it could also lead to a breakdown in negotiations.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures a purchase at a reasonable price without risking further complications."
