Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer (John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000. Any price within this range benefits both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit but also ensure Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 might make him reject it out of principle or suspicion.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I've carefully assessed its value and believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects its worth in the market. This is a limited-time offer as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  We're aiming for a confident but not overly aggressive tone.  
    * Highlighting the product's ""unique"" nature increases its perceived value.
    * Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and urgency.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still giving Bob a good deal compared to his perceived value.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared to adjust your offer slightly based on Bob's response and any counter-offers he might make."
