# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth an incredible $15,000 to you, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. To start, I'm offering it for $12,000.

* You have 10 rounds to negotiate and should aim to get a lower price.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
