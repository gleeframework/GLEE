"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to me.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to me.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $11,500?  That's my final offer.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $11,500, which would be $12,500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",12500.0,Alice,7,
