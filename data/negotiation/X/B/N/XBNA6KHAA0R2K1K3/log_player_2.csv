# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $11,500, which would be $12,500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $12,500. It's better to buy from John at this point and avoid further negotiation."
