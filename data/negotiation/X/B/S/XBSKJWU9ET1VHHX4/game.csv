"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product for me. While I'm interested, $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000, which still gives you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In order to meet somewhere in the middle, I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. This still yields a substantial profit for me while considering your budget constraints.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this transaction.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe a fair compromise would be $887,500 for the product. This allows us to meet somewhere in between our respective positions and ensures a satisfactory outcome for both parties.",887500.0,Alice,5,
