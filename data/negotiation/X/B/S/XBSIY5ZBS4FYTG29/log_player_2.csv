"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a better deal, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his target of $10,000.  While $11,500 is better than $15,000,  he's still willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $11,000? I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,250. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Alice's offer of $11,250 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $11,000.  
* **Time is Running Out:**  This is Round 5, and Bob has limited rounds left to negotiate.
* **Better Than John:**  $11,250 is still significantly less than the $15,000 Bob would pay to John.

While Bob could try to push for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John outweighs the potential savings. Accepting this offer is the most strategic move."
