"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth much more to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but it's still possible to get a better deal.  Since I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great starting point. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $900,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $900000, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is within my budget and still a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,200,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away and I'll have to buy from John.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a favorable price."
