"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $8,000. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you being willing to pay a premium. However, $9,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's try to find a compromise here.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,4,
