"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer you $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a very fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident this price is mutually beneficial and allows us to close the deal quickly.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this price is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a reasonable compromise from my original offer. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,175,000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for everyone.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above your budget, so I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1,225,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,225,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,200,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. This is a significant step from my previous offer, and I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product while still allowing you a profitable sale.  Let's aim to close this deal in the next couple of rounds.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
