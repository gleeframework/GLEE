Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to get as close to $90 as possible. While we could try to haggle further, $88 is a good price and it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk the price going up or running out of rounds."
