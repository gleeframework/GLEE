Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. Any deal needs to bridge this gap creatively or accept that John is the better buyer.

**Strategies**

1. **High Anchor, Room to Negotiate:**  Start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value to create room for negotiation. 

   * **Example:**
     ```json
     {""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
     ```

2. **Direct but Firm:**  Present a price slightly above Bob's valuation, hoping he sees the extra value as minimal. This has a higher risk of immediate rejection.

   * **Example:**
     ```json
     {""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product at a premium price of $1,250,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering its potential to significantly benefit you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
     ```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Rejection:** If Bob rejects your offer, you have a guaranteed sale with John.  Don't be afraid to walk away.
* **Relationship:**  Is a future relationship with Bob valuable? If so, a more accommodating approach might be better, even if it means slightly less profit now.

**Which strategy you choose depends on your overall goals and risk tolerance.**"
