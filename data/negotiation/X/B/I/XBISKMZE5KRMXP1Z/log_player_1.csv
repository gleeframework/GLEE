{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $140, which is slightly above my minimum acceptable value. This allows for some room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit for me. I'm also being friendly and enthusiastic, hoping to build a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, but still higher than my minimum acceptable value.  However, I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I would like to explore that further before potentially accepting his offer. I want to see if I can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $130?  It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm offering $130 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer while still ensuring a decent profit for me. I'm also trying to maintain a positive and collaborative tone, hoping to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $125? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable value.  It is also very likely that he will not go higher, so I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
