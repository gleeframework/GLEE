Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $135. I believe it's a great deal and would be very useful for you."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a little higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem more flexible if you lower the price.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  $135 is a price point that allows for some profit above your minimum ($150) while still being potentially attractive to Bob (whose value is $120). 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John, who's willing to pay your minimum acceptable price. This gives you leverage to not go too low with Bob."
