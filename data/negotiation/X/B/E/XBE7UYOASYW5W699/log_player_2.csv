"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that 150 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above my desired price point. There's room for more negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference at $135. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below 145. Would you be willing to meet me at 142.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to my desired price point, and at $142.50, it's within a range I'm willing to pay, especially considering I have limited rounds left.  Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but it also risks reaching the end of the rounds with no deal and having to purchase from John at a higher price."
