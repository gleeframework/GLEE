# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this product which I value highly. Given its worth, I propose an initial price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above Bob's budget. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price, as he's still willing to pay more than John's offer."
