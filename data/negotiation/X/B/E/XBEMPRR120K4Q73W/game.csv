,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product, as I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product and is a significant step closer to what I can afford. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
