"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still trying to get closer to my desired value. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good compromise."
