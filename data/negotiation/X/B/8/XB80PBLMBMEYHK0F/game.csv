,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I'd love to hear if you're willing to meet me at this price.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still trying to save a bit of money. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I'd love to see if we can get even closer to my target. Can you consider $9,200?",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a price that works for us both. However, $9,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,700. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",9700.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,700 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I'd love to see if we can meet in the middle. Can you consider $9,550?",9550.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,550 is still a little below what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to go down to $9,600. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",9600.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your patience and flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, and that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to accept this price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",9500.0,Bob,10,
