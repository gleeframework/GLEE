"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $90. This is more than you're willing to pay. 
* You have other options, including buying from John for $80, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering $75, which is still above my personal value for the product ($80) but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. 
* This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still staying within my budget. 
* I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if she doesn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $85 is still above my personal value of $80 for the product.
* I'm not willing to pay more than $80, and I have the option of buying from John at that price. 
* Therefore, it's still worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* My goal is to buy the product for as close to my personal value of $80 as possible.
* I've already rejected Alice's offer of $85, and I'm not willing to pay more than $80.
* This counteroffer is my final offer, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it. If she doesn't, I'll buy the product from John for $80."
