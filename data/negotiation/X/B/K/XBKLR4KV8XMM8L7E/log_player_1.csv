"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):** We start significantly above both our minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's eagerness. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""unique value and potential,"" hinting at reasons beyond Bob's initial assessment for the high price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting high, we aim to anchor the negotiation in our favor. Even if Bob counteroffers low, we have a better chance of settling closer to our desired range.

**Important Note:** We always have the John option ($1,500,000 guaranteed) in our back pocket if negotiations go south."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is simply out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  Let's start with this and see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. We have room to negotiate and eight rounds remaining. 

**Strategy for Round 3:**

We'll come down from our initial offer but remain firm above our $1,500,000 threshold. A counteroffer around $1,900,000-$2,000,000 would signal willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial offer is a bit lower than I had in mind, I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we consider a price of $1,950,000? I believe this reflects the true value and potential of the product."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We've significantly lowered our price from $2,200,000 to $1,950,000, demonstrating movement and a desire to make a deal. 
* **Above Minimum, But Negotiable:** The $1,950,000 price point keeps us comfortably above our $1,500,000 minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message reiterates the ""true value and potential"" to justify the price and potentially shift Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob increased his offer to $1,400,000, it remains below our absolute minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Slow Progress:**  We've made significant concessions, but Bob's counteroffers are moving up relatively slowly. This suggests it might be challenging to bridge the gap within a reasonable number of rounds.
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:** We have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John. This eliminates risk and guarantees we meet our minimum acceptable price.

**Conclusion:**

Rather than risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially settling for a lower price, it's strategically advantageous to accept John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
