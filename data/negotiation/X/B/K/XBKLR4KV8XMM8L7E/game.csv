"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is simply out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  Let's start with this and see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial offer is a bit lower than I had in mind, I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we consider a price of $1,950,000? I believe this reflects the true value and potential of the product.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
