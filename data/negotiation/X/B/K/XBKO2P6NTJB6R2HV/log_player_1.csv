Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a good middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value.  I want to gauge his initial interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is tempting, I'm not ready to settle just yet. Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum value. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not convinced it's the best deal.  I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round. There are still 6 rounds left and I have the option of selling to John if I don't feel like I'm getting a good deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. It's a fair compromise and a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still need to save a bit more. Would you be willing to go as low as $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price range, and I still have four rounds left.  Also, I can still sell to John for $8,000 if I need to."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm feeling a bit stuck here.  I can't go any lower than $9,750. This is a significant price reduction, and I'm confident this product is worth every penny.  Let's finalize this deal and make it happen. "", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close, but I still need to save a bit more. Would you be willing to go as low as $9,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Even though Bob is getting closer, it's getting late in the game and I'm not confident I can get a better deal. With only two rounds left, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal and ending up with a price lower than what John is offering."
