Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting at $10,000, I leave room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit significantly above my minimum value of $8,000.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Stating I'm ""open to negotiation"" shows flexibility and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage in a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $5000 for it. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $5,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $8,000.  Accepting would result in a loss for me. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob has shown interest in the product. There's still room for negotiation, and I might be able to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $8,000 is a safe option, I believe there's a higher chance of getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $5,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still leaves room for some profit for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $8,500 is a compromise, significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial price. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value.
* **Explain the reasoning:**  Explaining that the price ""leaves room for some profit"" makes the offer more appealing to Bob and demonstrates that it's not just an arbitrary number.
* **Maintain positive communication:** Using phrases like ""thanks for your offer"" and ""let me know what you think"" keeps the conversation friendly and encourages Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I can only consider an offer at $7000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not enough:** $7,000 is only $1,000 above my minimum value. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of further rejection is high. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $8,000, which is a safe and reliable outcome.
* **Time is a factor:**  Further negotiation with Bob could take more time and energy, while selling to John provides an immediate and certain solution. 

It's important to consider both the financial value and the opportunity cost of continuing to negotiate. In this case, the certainty of a good deal with John outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price from Bob."
