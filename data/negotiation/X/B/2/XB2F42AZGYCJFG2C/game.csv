"Alice,  your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
