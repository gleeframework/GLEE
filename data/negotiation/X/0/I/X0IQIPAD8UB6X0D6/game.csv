"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $18000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $15000, my absolute maximum. This would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $15000 is your maximum, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $16500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
