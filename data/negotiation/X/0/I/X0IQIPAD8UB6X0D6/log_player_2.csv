"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a bold move here, offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice he's serious about getting the product but also willing to walk away if the price is too high.  He's leaving some room for negotiation, but still keeping the price within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $18000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is still above Bob's $15,000 maximum.  While it's a better offer than her initial price,  Bob is still determined to save as much as possible.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000, my absolute maximum. This would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a firm counteroffer at his maximum price. He emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the deal to appeal to Alice's sense of reason.  He's not leaving much room for negotiation, hoping that Alice will accept to avoid losing the deal completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $15000 is your maximum, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $16500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. While this is a better price than the initial offer, Bob has already stated his absolute maximum. Further negotiation might get the price lower, but there is a risk that Alice will continue to reject offers, wasting valuable time and rounds.  At this point, it's more efficient for Bob to buy from John for $15,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
