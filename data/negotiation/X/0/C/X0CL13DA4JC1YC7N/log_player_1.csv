Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm suggesting a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still keeping the price well above your minimum ($800,000). 
* **Confident Positioning:** The message frames the offer as valuable and exclusive, subtly encouraging Bob to accept. 

**Important:**  This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and knowledge about Bob's negotiating style, you could adjust the price slightly higher or lower."
