"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and I'm willing to make a serious offer for the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm confident this product is worth more. I'm offering $850,000, which is still a significant discount from my original price and a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $900,000 to $850,000, but I'm still not convinced that's a good price for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $780,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",780000.0,Bob,4,
