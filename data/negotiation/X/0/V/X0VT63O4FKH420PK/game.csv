"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $725,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $725,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more in the range of $700,000. Would that be feasible?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $715,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",715000.0,Alice,5,
