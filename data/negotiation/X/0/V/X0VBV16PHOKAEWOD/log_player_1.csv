Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $115. I think it's a fair price that reflects its value."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin by offering the product at a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($120) to leave room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price makes it seem less arbitrary and potentially increases Bob's willingness to accept or offer a counteroffer closer to my asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to discussing the price further, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize my profit while considering Bob's perspective and keeping the $100 backup offer from John in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice,  $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is a reasonable profit, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($100) than my initial offer ($115). This suggests he's interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By suggesting $110, I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($105) and my previous asking price ($115).  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Simple and Clear:** The message is straightforward, focusing on the new price point without dwelling too much on the previous exchange.
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:** While closer to my minimum, the $110 price point still leaves me some room to potentially negotiate further if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference at $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly invested in negotiating a fair price and has again moved closer to my previous offer.  While $107.50 isn't the maximum I could potentially get, it's a solid profit margin above my minimum, and further haggling might risk losing the sale altogether. It's time to accept and close the deal."
