It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  I'll see if I can get Alice to come down a bit before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm starting with a reasonable counteroffer, 20% below Alice's initial price.  This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice has come down to $130, which is within my budget and a good price considering I'm willing to pay $150 for the product.  It's time to accept the offer and close the deal."
