"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $140? ",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $140 is a bit too low for me, considering the value. How about we meet in the middle at $155? That's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $155 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm happy to pay $150 for the product, which is a fair price considering it's worth that to you. What do you think?",150.0,Bob,4,
