"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $10,000. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price, possibly closer to your desired $8,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I would like to offer it to you for $9,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value you place on the product while also allowing me to achieve my desired return.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to your desired price, you can still potentially get a better deal. You've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, and Alice is also showing flexibility.  Rejecting the offer again allows you to counter with a slightly lower price, aiming to reach a compromise closer to $8,500."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I'm glad we're finding common ground. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I propose we finalize the transaction at $8,900. This offers a slight compromise that respects the value you see in the product while allowing me to achieve a satisfactory return. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $8,900 is just $900 above your desired price. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might get frustrated and stick to her $8,900 price. It's likely you won't be able to get much lower, and the time and effort spent on further negotiation might not be worth the potential savings.  Therefore, accepting the offer is the most logical choice in this situation."
