"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was thinking. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This feels like a fair price considering the quality and benefits you'll be receiving.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $18,000 is still too high for my budget.  Perhaps we could agree on $12,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations.  While I want to find a solution, I have to be mindful of the product's worth. Would you be willing to consider $16,000? This is a significant reduction on my end and reflects my desire to reach a deal.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still pushing my budget limits.  How about we settle at $13,000? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here.",13000.0,Bob,6,
