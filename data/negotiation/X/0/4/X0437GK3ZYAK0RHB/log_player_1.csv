"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. That's my maximum budget for this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob or sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a great value, and it's closer to my minimum.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm still hopeful that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation, and I'm willing to make a final concession.  Let's settle on $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to avoid selling to John at a lower price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to get concerned that I might have to walk away and buy from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is still below my desired price of $12,000, it's getting close.  I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, he might actually walk away and buy from John. It's better to secure the sale now at a reasonable price than to risk losing the deal altogether."
