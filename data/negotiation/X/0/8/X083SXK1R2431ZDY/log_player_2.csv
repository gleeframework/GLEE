"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Since I have a fallback option with John, there's no risk in rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer. I'm aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price.  This will give me room to negotiate if she rejects my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer. However, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about getting a deal.  $8500 is still a good price for me, and it's closer to her last offer. This should hopefully encourage her to accept."
