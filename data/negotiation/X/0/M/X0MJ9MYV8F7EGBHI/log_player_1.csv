Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to Bob's value, but still leaves me with a significant profit.  This also leaves room for negotiation if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is exactly what I offered him, so there's no benefit to accepting it. I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000} 
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,175,000. This keeps the negotiation moving, but still leaves a significant profit margin for me.  It's a smaller increase than Bob's last offer, so it hopefully signals that I'm serious about getting a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,170,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,170,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and I'm confident that if I reject it, I may not get a better offer. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm happy to accept it."
