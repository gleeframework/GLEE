Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a win-win situation. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
