"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth considering at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $12,000 is still too high.  He can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our positions, and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While $10,500 is lower than Alice's previous offer, it is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I am willing to offer the product at $9,500. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it will be satisfactory for both parties involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's still more than he wants to pay, it's only $500 more than his most recent counteroffer, and he's only got 5 rounds left.  If he rejects this offer, he risks Alice getting frustrated and making a worse offer in the next round or even ending the negotiation. It's likely that if he rejects this offer, he will end up buying from John at $8,000, and this option is only $500 less than Alice's offer."
