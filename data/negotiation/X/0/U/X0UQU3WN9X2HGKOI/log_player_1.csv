"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This is well above my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's initial interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a significant sum, it's below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum value but closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this signals my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to take the risk of another round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering $1,250,000.  This is only $50,000 above my minimum, and I'm hoping it's enough to entice Bob into accepting. I'm running out of rounds, and selling to John at this point is becoming a more attractive option."
