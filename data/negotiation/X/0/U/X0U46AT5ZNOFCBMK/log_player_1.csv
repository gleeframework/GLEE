{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $14,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is a little higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  This price gives me some wiggle room if Bob counteroffers, and allows for a potential win-win scenario.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $11,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob. He's expressed interest in the product, and I believe there's still room for a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's initial counteroffer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,500 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would still give you a good deal and let me move the product. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a compromise that still benefits me.  The $13,000 price is significantly higher than Bob's offer but allows for more negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm emphasizing that the price still gives Bob a good deal. This reinforces the value of the product.
* **Moving the Product:**  By mentioning ""moving the product,"" I subtly suggest that I'm willing to sell but also not desperate to accept any offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $12,800? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $12,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** Even though I'm accepting the offer, I can still try to negotiate for a slightly higher price in the future, as I know John is willing to pay more.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer is the most practical choice, as it secures a decent price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
