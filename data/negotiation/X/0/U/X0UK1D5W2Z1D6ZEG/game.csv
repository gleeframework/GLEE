"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully curated and valued at $12,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This price reflects the unique value I've put into it. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss further. If not, I understand, and I'll be selling it to another buyer.",13500.0,Alice,1,
