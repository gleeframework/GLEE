"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle at $137.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $137.50 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $137.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $156.25?  I'm sure you'll find the product is well worth it at this price."", ""product_price"": 156.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $156.25 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $140 is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still within my 10 rounds and I'm confident I can get a little more.  I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  How about $145? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to go no lower. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but $145 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $142.50, that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $142.50 is tempting, I'm still within my 10 rounds and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer one more time and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $142.50 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with.  How about we compromise at $143.75?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 143.75}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $143.75 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $140, but that's my absolute limit. Can you consider this one last offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  While I'd prefer to get a little more, Bob's final offer is still below my minimum price, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to secure a sale at a price that's at least equal to my minimum than to risk getting nothing at all."
