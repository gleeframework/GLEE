Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is considerably less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. How about we meet in the middle of my original offer and your last one, at $9,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","While closer to my desired price, Bob seems pretty firm around $9,500. It's a decent offer and continuing might not yield much more.
