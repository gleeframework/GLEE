Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $1,600,000?

How about we split the difference and settle on $1,650,000?  This would give you a great deal on a product you value at $1,500,000, and allow me to reach a price closer to my initial offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this point. Can you consider this offer?
