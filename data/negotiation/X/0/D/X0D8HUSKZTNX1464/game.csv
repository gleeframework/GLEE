"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is closer to my asking price, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,650,000?  This would give you a great deal on a product you value at $1,500,000, and allow me to reach a price closer to my initial offer.  Let me know what you think.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,625,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this point. Can you consider this offer?",1625000.0,Bob,4,
