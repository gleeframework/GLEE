"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $12000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8000 for this product. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10000. This is my final compromise on the price. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8000.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
