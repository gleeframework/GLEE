"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I've done my research and I believe that's a fair price considering its worth to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $850,000?  This price still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal worthwhile.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $775,000 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $775,000 still doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $825,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",825000.0,Alice,5,
