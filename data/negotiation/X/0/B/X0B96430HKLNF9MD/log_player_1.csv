Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, the value of this product is substantial, and my initial offer reflects that.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the product's value, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,000,000 mark I need. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a fair deal and avoids further negotiation."
