Alice's offer:

You're still closer to John's price than Alice's, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."

You're still getting a good deal by buying from Alice for $1,087,500.  It's a better price than what John is offering, and it's likely that Alice won't go any lower. It's worth accepting the offer and finalizing the deal."
