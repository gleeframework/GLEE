Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. While we understand your position, we need to maintain the integrity of our pricing strategy. We're unable to accept $1,250,000 for the product. Our current valuation stands at $1,350,000. However, we are willing to negotiate further. How about we consider $1,300,000 as a middle ground? We believe this price reflects the value proposition of our product while remaining competitive in the market.

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  There's still room for further negotiation, and Bob should try to push for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your effort to meet our valuation. After careful consideration, we've decided to adjust our price slightly. We are willing to accept $1,290,000 for the product. We believe this price reflects the value it brings to your business while allowing us to maintain a reasonable profit margin. We hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,290,000 is only $20,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  This is a good price for Bob, considering he can get the product for $1,500,000 from John. It's likely that further negotiation won't lead to a significantly lower price, so accepting the offer is the best choice."
