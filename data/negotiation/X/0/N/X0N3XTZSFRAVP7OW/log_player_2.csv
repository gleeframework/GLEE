Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go all the way to $12,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. I think that's a fair price for this great product. What do you think?

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $13,000. It's better to cut my losses and buy from John for $12,000, saving me $1,000 and avoiding further negotiation."
