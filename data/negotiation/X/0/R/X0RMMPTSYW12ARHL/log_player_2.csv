Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $800,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.
