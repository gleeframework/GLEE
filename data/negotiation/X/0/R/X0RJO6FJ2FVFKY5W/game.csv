"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider  $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer, I'm hoping we can settle on a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product for $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
