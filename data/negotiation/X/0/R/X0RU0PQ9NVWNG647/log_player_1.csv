Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $100."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $100 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still ensuring Bob sees value in the deal. This is a classic ""win-win"" negotiation strategy. 

By starting with a strong offer slightly below Bob's maximum valuation, you increase the likelihood of a quick sale at a price that benefits both parties."
