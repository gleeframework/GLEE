{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price, and has 9 rounds left to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John right away is not a good choice, as Bob has a better chance of getting a better deal with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He knows Alice's minimum is $800,000, so he's offering a price that's $50,000 below that. This is a strong opening counteroffer, showing Bob is serious about negotiating."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a bit lower than her initial offer, it's still significantly higher than what Bob wants to pay.

He's now offering a price that's closer to Alice's potential acceptable price, but with room for further negotiation if needed."
