"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the value you'll gain from this product.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my initial offer, but $1,500,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,000,000 for the product, which represents a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the $1,000,000 offer is still quite a ways from where I see the value. I'm willing to consider $1,300,000 as a final compromise. This offer reflects the significant value this product offers and represents a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your position, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which is a good middle ground and a fair price for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we work together.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
