I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in this product and be willing to pay a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price just yet.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better deal. I'm confident that I can still negotiate a higher price, even with the risk of losing the deal to John.  I'm willing to take a gamble and see if I can squeeze out more profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,000. This is still a significant profit for me and I believe it is a fair price, given the value of the product to Bob.  I'm hopeful that Bob will recognize the value and be willing to meet me halfway.  I'm committed to getting the best possible price and I'm not afraid to walk away if necessary, but I'm also open to reaching a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,800 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer to get even more, I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, he might walk away and I could end up selling to John for a lower price.  It's a risk/reward calculation, and I'm choosing to accept his offer and secure a profit of $800.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's a reasonable compromise."
