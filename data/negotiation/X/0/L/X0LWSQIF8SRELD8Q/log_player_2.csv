Round 5
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and it's still significantly higher than John's price of $8,000. It's unlikely she'll come down enough to make it worthwhile for you to continue negotiating.  You can save a significant amount of money by going with John."
