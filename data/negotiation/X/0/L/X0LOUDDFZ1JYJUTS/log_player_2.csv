You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. Since you're willing to go as high as $10,000 for the product, it's worth another round of negotiation to see if you can get closer to that target. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to finalize the deal."
