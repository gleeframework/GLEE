"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $115 for it.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $125. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $125 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to do $120?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot by coming down to $125, and I'm not willing to give up more value. I'm willing to meet you at $123, which is still a good deal for both of us. This is my final offer.",123.0,Alice,5,
