Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think it's a great deal and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $120 as possible, but needs to offer Bob an incentive to buy. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** While this offer is just below Alice's minimum, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested. 
* **Guaranteed alternative:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John at $120."
