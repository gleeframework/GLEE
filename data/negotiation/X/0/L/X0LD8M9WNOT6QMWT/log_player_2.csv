"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Alice's offer is $120, which is your maximum price.  However, you have the option to buy from John for the same price.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and see if you can get a better deal from someone else.  By rejecting, you don't lose anything, and you might find a lower price."
