Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $13,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to the product's value for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer. I can still get a higher price, especially since Bob clearly values the product more than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $12,500. It's a slight compromise from my initial offer but still leaves some room for profit. I'm hoping to meet halfway with Bob and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject it. There's still a chance I can get closer to my target price of $12,500.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $12,000. I'm willing to meet Bob halfway again and hope this will be the final offer before selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob is clearly unwilling to meet my price, and I'm not willing to go lower.  While it's not ideal,  I'd rather secure the $10,000 than risk further negotiations."
