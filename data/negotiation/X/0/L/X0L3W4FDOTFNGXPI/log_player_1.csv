I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer.  I want to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 17000}

I'm offering $17,000. This is still a good price for me, and it's closer to my initial offer, showing some willingness to compromise. I hope this will encourage Bob to come up on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer. I'm hoping I can get Bob to come up a little more before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $14,000. This is a considerable reduction from my previous offer, demonstrating that I'm serious about making a deal. However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price, and I hope Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still too low.  I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. This is a good deal for me, as it is my minimum acceptable price and I avoid further negotiation with Bob."
