"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth discussing the price, and I'm open to negotiations. My initial offer is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's initial offer is at your maximum budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  Rejecting allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price, saving money.  You can always buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you being open to negotiations. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, and $1,100,000 is still within my budget.  Accepting saves me $100,000 compared to buying from John and keeps negotiations moving forward.  There's always the possibility of getting a lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or the negotiation dragging on outweighs the potential savings at this point."
