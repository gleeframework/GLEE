"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
