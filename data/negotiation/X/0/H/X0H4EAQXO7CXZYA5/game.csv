"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I know it's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $7,000 is below my minimum price, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $8,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This reflects a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
