"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $11,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,000? This price still reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,800? I'm willing to pay a bit more for the product, but I need to stay within my means.",12800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the value of the product.  While $12,800 is getting closer, I still need to make a fair profit. How about $13,500?  This price is a good compromise, and I believe it's still within your budget while allowing me to continue negotiating in good faith. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement this round.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about making a fair profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,800 and $13,500. How about $13,150? I think this is a fair compromise that allows us to reach an agreement.",13150.0,Bob,6,
