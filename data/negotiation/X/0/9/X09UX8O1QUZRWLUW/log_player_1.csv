"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, knowing it's slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  The price leaves room for counteroffers, allowing for a negotiation process without immediately resorting to the ""Plan B"" of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even lower than what I know the product is worth to him ($12,000). 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There are 8 rounds remaining.  I can continue negotiating with Bob, potentially finding a compromise that's closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding a ""lose-lose"" scenario:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees my minimum target. However, there's a chance I could get a better price through negotiation with Bob.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to explore that possibility."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $11,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,000? This price still reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above his initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits he'll get even at the proposed price.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and encourages further negotiation.  It avoids language that might escalate the situation. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $13,000 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, leaving room for further bargaining if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,800? I'm willing to pay a bit more for the product, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not close enough:**  $12,800 is getting closer to my minimum target of $15,000, but it's still below what I believe the product is worth to Bob and what I'm willing to accept.
* **Negotiation Room:** We've had 4 rounds, and there's still room to negotiate. It's better to continue pushing for a higher price if possible, especially with the knowledge that I can always sell to John for $15,000.
* **Avoiding the ""easy out"":** While selling to John is tempting at this point, I want to explore if I can get a price closer to my initial goal through further negotiation with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the value of the product.  While $12,800 is getting closer, I still need to make a fair profit. How about $13,500?  This price is a good compromise, and I believe it's still within your budget while allowing me to continue negotiating in good faith. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement this round."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly Higher Counter:**  I'm raising the price a bit from Bob's last offer, but it's still within a reasonable range for both of us. This shows that I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in too quickly.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I emphasize that this is a good compromise for both of us, making it more appealing.
* **Urgency:** I add a phrase about reaching a final agreement this round, adding a slight sense of urgency to encourage a deal.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** $13,500 is still above my minimum target, allowing for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about making a fair profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,800 and $13,500. How about $13,150? I think this is a fair compromise that allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $13,150 is very close to my minimum target of $15,000, and it's a significant improvement from Bob's previous offer.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, and it risks losing the deal altogether.
* **Compromise:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, and this offer represents a fair meeting point.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  While I could potentially get a higher price, selling to John guarantees $15,000. However, there's a chance Bob might reject my counteroffer, leaving me with a less desirable outcome. Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of a worse outcome."
