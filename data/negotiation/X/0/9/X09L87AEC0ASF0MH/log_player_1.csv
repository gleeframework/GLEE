Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $16,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below its value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still outside of my price range. I'm happy to offer $9,500, which is closer to my budget and reflects the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While I'm motivated to sell, I need to get a fair price.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $11,750?"", ""product_price"": 11750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $11,750 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, the increments are getting smaller and it's unlikely he'll reach a price close enough to your $12,000 guarantee with John.  You've made a good effort to negotiate with Bob, but it's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed offer from John."
