"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $16,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below its value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still outside of my price range. I'm happy to offer $9,500, which is closer to my budget and reflects the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While I'm motivated to sell, I need to get a fair price.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $11,750 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's close the deal at this price.",10500.0,Bob,6,
