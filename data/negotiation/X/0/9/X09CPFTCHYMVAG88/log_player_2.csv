Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but I'm not going any lower. I'm willing to throw in the premium service package again, and I'll also give you a 5% discount on the product. That's the best I can do. Would you be willing to meet me at $108 with the package and the discount? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation.  Here's why accepting is the best choice:

* **Value:**  While you're still aiming for a lower price, Alice is getting close to her minimum.  The extra package and discount make it a better deal than buying from John.
* **Time:** You're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Rejecting and trying to negotiate further risks running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price. 

You're getting a decent deal and securing the product, making it worthwhile to accept Alice's offer."
