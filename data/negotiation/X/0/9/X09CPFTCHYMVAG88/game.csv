"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but I'm not going any lower. I'm willing to throw in the premium service package again, and I'll also give you a 5% discount on the product. That's the best I can do. Would you be willing to meet me at $108 with the package and the discount?",108.0,Alice,7,
