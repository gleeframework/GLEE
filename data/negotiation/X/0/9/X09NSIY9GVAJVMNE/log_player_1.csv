Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but not excessively high. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is my minimum, I'd like to try and get closer to my initial asking price of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90 as a compromise.  This is a more reasonable price considering Bob's offer of $80, and hopefully, he will accept. It's a good middle ground that allows for some profit while still being competitive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is close enough to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for $80. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the possibility of a lower price."
