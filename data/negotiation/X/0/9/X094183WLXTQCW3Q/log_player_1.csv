Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $12,000, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit for Alice.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value and potential demand, justifying the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  Even if Bob rejects the $18,000 offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John. This strategy maximizes her potential earnings."
