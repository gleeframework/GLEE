"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing it as a potential win-win for Bob, highlighting the value of the product for him. 
* **Strategy:**  This first offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go. If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent rounds, but I want to keep the pressure on to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there is still room for negotiation with Bob. I can likely secure a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John at this stage would be a good outcome, but I want to explore if I can get closer to my target price with Bob first. 

**Next Round:** I will send Bob a counteroffer closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10,000 is a bit too low for me right now, but I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm coming down slightly from my initial offer, but still holding firm above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and emphasizing the discount I'm offering. This helps keep the negotiation focused on finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions, but it's still a relatively high price that I believe Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** Although Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, his offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation with Bob. His offer shows that he's willing to go higher.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $15,000 would be the most profitable outcome, I'm determined to see if I can reach a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Round:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my target but still above Bob's current offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it's also a good deal for me.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price that is midway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. 
* **Message:** I'm appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and highlighting the value he will get from the product.  
* **Strategy:**  By meeting him halfway, I'm showing flexibility while still maintaining a price that's acceptable to me. This could push Bob to accept the offer, but if not, it leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is increasing his offer, $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is running out:**  We are nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and I want to avoid losing the opportunity to sell to John for a higher price.
* **Possible counteroffer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement. 

**Next Round:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to drop the price to $10,000, but this is my final offer. I really think this product is perfect for you, and this price reflects the value you'll get out of it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm coming down to $10,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price, but closer to Bob's offer.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing this is my final offer, creating urgency. I'm also reiterating the value of the product for Bob.
* **Strategy:**  This is a last-ditch effort to reach an agreement with Bob. If he rejects, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I really like the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, $9,750 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time is running out:** We are approaching the end of the negotiation rounds. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  I've reached a point where selling to John for $15,000 is the most sensible option. This guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of Bob continuing to offer lower prices. 

**Reasoning:**  I've been trying to negotiate with Bob, but I'm not confident that I can get him to meet my minimum price.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, it's wiser to end the negotiation with Bob and secure the higher profit."
