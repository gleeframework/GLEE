"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $135 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $110. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115. Let's try to find a compromise.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more.  Let's settle on $120.  That's my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,
