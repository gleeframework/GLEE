"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. It's also a significant premium over my minimum, ensuring I'm still making a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$12,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round.  I'm still optimistic I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $17,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still higher than my minimum, and it might be attractive enough for Bob to accept. I'm aiming for a compromise that will leave us both satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 meets my minimum requirement.  It's not my ideal price, but given the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of Bob rejecting another counteroffer, it's in my best interest to accept and close the deal."
