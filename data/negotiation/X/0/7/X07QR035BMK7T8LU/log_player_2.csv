"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $850,000. Considering its value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle of our last offers, and offer $950,000 for the product.  This price is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs and leaves some room for a final agreement. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming to find a compromise that's closer to my desired price point.  Meeting halfway between our last offers shows a willingness to collaborate and hopefully leads to a faster conclusion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is still a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Considering our previous offers, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and its value to you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $1,050,000 is still too high. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation before considering buying from John. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a compromise."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,050,000 is still above my target, I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This represents a significant step towards your last offer and leaves just a small gap for us to close.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing for a price that's just below Alice's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this small gap will encourage Alice to accept my offer, but I'm prepared for another round of negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 9

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,025,000 is still not enough for me to consider selling the product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,125,000 is still above my budget, and we're running out of rounds.  To avoid risking further negotiation and potentially losing the opportunity to buy from John, I'm going to go ahead and buy the product from John for $800,000. While I'd have preferred to negotiate a lower price with Alice, securing the product within my budget is the priority."
