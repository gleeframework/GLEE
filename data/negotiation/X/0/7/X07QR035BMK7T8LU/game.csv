"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation.  What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $850,000. Considering its value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your budget and the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle of our last offers, and offer $950,000 for the product.  This price is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs and leaves some room for a final agreement. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is still a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Considering our previous offers, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and its value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,050,000 is still above my target, I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This represents a significant step towards your last offer and leaves just a small gap for us to close.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still not enough for me to consider selling the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and its value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your position. While $1,075,000 is still outside my budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and offer $1,025,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my side, and I believe it's a fair price considering both of our needs. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,025,000 is still not enough for me to consider selling the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me at a price that reflects the product's true value to me. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,9,
