"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, he might be willing to pay a bit more, especially since he's interested in the product.  This also gives me some room to negotiate downwards if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell at a loss. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's a step closer to his valuation.  I'm hoping this demonstrates flexibility while still being within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm starting to get nervous about the time ticking down, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $15,500.  This is a significant compromise on my end, bringing me closer to Bob's offer and closer to my minimum. I believe this shows a willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally offered my minimum price of $15,000. While I would have preferred to get more,  I'm not going to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John at the same price.  I'm going to accept his offer and finalize the sale."
