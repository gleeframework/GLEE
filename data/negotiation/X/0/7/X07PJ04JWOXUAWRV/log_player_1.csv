"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while still acknowledging the product's value.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can get a better offer from Bob, or at least hold out for John's offer of $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 6

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm ready to close this deal today, but I need you to meet me halfway. My final offer is $1,000,000.

This is a tricky situation.  Bob's offer is exactly my minimum, but I've already spent a lot of time negotiating. It's also the same price as what John is offering.  To avoid risking losing out on a sale entirely, I'll accept Bob's offer."
