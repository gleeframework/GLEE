"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and it gives you a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
