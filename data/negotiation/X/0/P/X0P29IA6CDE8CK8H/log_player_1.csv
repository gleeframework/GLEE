I'm starting with an ambitious price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary while still exceeding my minimum value of $12,000. It's also high enough to signal to Bob that I believe the product is valuable.  Let's see if he's willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. I believe the product has more value than $12,000, and I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm going to counter with $13,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's a fair price that acknowledges Bob's interest but also reflects the value I believe the product holds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob seems very firm on his price, and I'm not willing to keep going back and forth. Since John is willing to buy the product for my minimum acceptable price, I'll take the sure thing and sell to him."
