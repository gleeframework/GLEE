{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. It also provides a friendly tone and emphasizes the potential benefit for Bob, making him more likely to engage in a discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum valuation of $15,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum valuation, it's still not ideal. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,000.  It's getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,250.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're close, but I'm not comfortable going above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is the highest I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is still below my minimum valuation.  I've spent enough time negotiating and I'm confident I can get my desired price from John, so I will sell the product to him."
