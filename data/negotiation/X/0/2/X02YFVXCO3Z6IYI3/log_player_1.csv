Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

We're still significantly below the product's value and my desired price. It's worth seeing if Bob is willing to move closer to the $1.5 million mark."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,800,000 is still a little steep for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,550,000?

This is a great offer! Bob is now offering more than my fallback price with John. It's time to close the deal."
