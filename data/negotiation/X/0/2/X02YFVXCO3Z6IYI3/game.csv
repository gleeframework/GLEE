"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. I'm getting closer, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I understand your position, but the product offers significant and unique value.  I could consider $1,800,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my willingness to find a fair agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,800,000 is still a little steep for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Bob,6,
