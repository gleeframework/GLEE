,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to me and I'm sure we can find a compromise.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $8,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for both of us. ",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,250 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,375. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",8375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,375 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm confident we can close this deal at $8,100. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",8100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,100 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $8,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",8250.0,Alice,7,
