"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's significantly lower than its worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested and we can finalize the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than her product's worth to her, you know you can get a better deal from John. Buying from John at $1,000,000 saves you a significant $250,000."
