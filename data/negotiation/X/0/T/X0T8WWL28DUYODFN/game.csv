"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm asking for $1,400,000, a price I believe reflects its true worth. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,400,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand your budget limitations. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your financial constraints. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,325,000. I believe this price is fair for both parties and respects the value of the product.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your fair counteroffer.  While I value our negotiation,  $1,325,000 still falls short of my desired price. To find common ground, I'm willing to drop to $1,340,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a price that fairly reflects the product's value.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
