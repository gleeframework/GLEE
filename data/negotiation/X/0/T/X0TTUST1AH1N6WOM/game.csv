"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to get the sale done.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $8,250? It's a compromise, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that. How about we settle this at $8,000 even? That's a fair offer, and it would allow us to close the deal today.",8000.0,Bob,6,
