Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum value, giving you some room to negotiate.  By expressing your belief in the fairness of the price, you subtly imply that you are open to negotiation but are confident in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's worth trying to squeeze out a little more. You can use this opportunity to gauge Bob's true interest and willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $15,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but how about $17,500? This would still give you a good deal, and allow me to recover some of my investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $17500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $16500? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $16,500 is a good compromise. It's a bit lower than what you were hoping for, but it's still above your minimum and a significant improvement over his initial offer. It's also worth noting that if you reject this offer, you'll be stuck with John's offer of $15,000."
