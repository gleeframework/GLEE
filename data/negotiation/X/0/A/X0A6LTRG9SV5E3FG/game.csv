,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $15000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but how about $17500? This would still give you a good deal, and allow me to recover some of my investment. Let me know what you think.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $17500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $16500? I think that's a fair price for the product.",16500.0,Bob,4,
