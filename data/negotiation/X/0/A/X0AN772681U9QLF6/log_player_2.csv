"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than $150 from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $130 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell it to you for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  Alice's offer of $135 is within Bob's budget of $150 and lower than John's price. 
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could potentially push for a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially raising her price again is present.  
* **Time:**  It's only round 3, and there's still time to negotiate if Bob wants. However, accepting this offer secures the product at a good price without risking a long negotiation."
