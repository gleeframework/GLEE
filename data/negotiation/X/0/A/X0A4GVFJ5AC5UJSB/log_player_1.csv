Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,100,000,  given its potential worth to your business."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strong But Not Greedy:** Offering it at $1,100,000 gives Bob a substantial saving compared to his valuation while still securing a significant profit for you.

This strategy aims for a win-win outcome. Bob gets the product at a price lower than its worth to him, and you maximize your profit beyond what you'd get from John."
