Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity, but I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  Given the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your position, I still feel there's room for a more favorable agreement.

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Bob will not budge much further. Accepting his offer ensures you get a good deal and avoid potentially losing the sale to John."
