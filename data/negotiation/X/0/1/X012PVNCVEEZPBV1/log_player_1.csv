"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking to my offer of $80. Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is holding firm at his valuation of $80, which is significantly below my minimum price.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge this gap. Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price and avoids potentially wasting more time with Bob."
