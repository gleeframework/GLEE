"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $14,000.  I think it will be very beneficial for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to do $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $14,000 represents a fair price for its value, I could be persuaded to go as low as $13,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still below Bob's maximum budget ($15,000).**  
* **Alice has stated this is her final offer, indicating there's little room for further negotiation.**  
* **Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer risks Alice walking away.**

Accepting the offer at $13,000 allows Bob to purchase the product while still saving $2,000 compared to buying from John."
