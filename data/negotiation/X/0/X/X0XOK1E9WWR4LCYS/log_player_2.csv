"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point. $140 is close to your max, but you can likely do better. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $130. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I can come down a bit to $135, but that's the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for a product you value at $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still within your budget and can potentially negotiate a lower price. It's worth trying to get closer to your target of $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  I'm still aiming for $130. Let's meet in the middle at $132.50?"", ""product_price"": 132.50}
