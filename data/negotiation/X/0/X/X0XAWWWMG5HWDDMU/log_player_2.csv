This is too high of a price. It makes more sense to try to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John's offer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

Alice's offer is still above my preferred price point. While it is closer to my target, there is still room for negotiation. I will continue to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.
