"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $925,000 to make it worth my while. I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice is coming down in price, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  There's no reason to continue negotiating if he can get the product for a lower price elsewhere."
