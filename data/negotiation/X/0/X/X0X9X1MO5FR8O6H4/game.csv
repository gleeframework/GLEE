"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we settle on $85?  It's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $85. How about $77.50?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. $77.50 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $81. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still ensuring you get a good deal.",81.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $81 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $79, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",79.0,Bob,6,
