"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $110. How about we try $115? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $112? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $112. How about we meet you halfway between $115 and $112? That would be $113.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",113.5,Alice,5,
