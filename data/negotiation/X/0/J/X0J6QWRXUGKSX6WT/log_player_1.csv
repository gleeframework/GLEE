"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I'm hoping it will pique Bob's interest and encourage him to negotiate.  I'm also considering the potential of a counteroffer, which I'm prepared to respond to.  I'll keep an eye on the number of rounds remaining and the value of Bob's offers to decide whether to switch to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to ensure I get a price closer to my minimum value.  Selling to John is still a viable option if the negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum value, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to make further adjustments based on his response. I also need to keep an eye on the number of rounds and John's offer to decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'd like to get.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I'm also getting closer to John's offer, so I need to be careful about how much lower I go.  However, I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,250,000. This is getting very close to my minimum value, but I'm still hoping Bob will meet me in the middle.  I'm also starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds remaining.  If this offer is rejected, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is only $50,000 less than John's offer.  With only 4 rounds remaining, I don't have much time to negotiate further.  I'm accepting Bob's offer to avoid the risk of ending up with John's lower offer."
