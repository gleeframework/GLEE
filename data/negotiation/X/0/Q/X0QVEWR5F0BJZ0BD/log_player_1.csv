Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
