Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $120 is a good starting point. It's a significant markup from my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:**  Mentioning that the product is something Bob might appreciate can make him more inclined to accept the offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  By starting with $120, I'm prepared for Bob to counteroffer, and can then negotiate further. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profits while leaving open the possibility of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$100 is too low:** While $100 is a decent price, it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price of $120 and doesn't reflect the value I know the product holds. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob has expressed interest in the product and is willing to pay a price close to my minimum. This indicates room for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Offering $110 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable sale. 
* **Highlighting the value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value can increase his willingness to pay a higher price.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** Using phrases like ""great deal"" and ""let me know your thoughts"" keeps the negotiation friendly and encourages Bob to continue. 

This counteroffer aims to reach a mutually acceptable price while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
