{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $8,000. This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still above your minimum of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It's a clear starting point:** This gives Bob a concrete offer to consider and respond to.

By offering this price, you are setting the stage for a potential negotiation that could result in a successful sale at a price that is beneficial for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your desired price.  You have the option to sell to John for a much higher price, so it's worth holding out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $10,000 isn't enough for me to part with the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $11,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my situation, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still not able to meet at $11,000. I propose $9,500 as a counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while providing you with a reasonable return for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is now offering less than $10,000. While it's still better than nothing, it's getting dangerously close to your minimum. Considering John is willing to pay $15,000, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. It's time to move on and secure a much better deal."
