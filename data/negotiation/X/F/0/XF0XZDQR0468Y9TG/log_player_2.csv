"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business.  I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us.  Are you interested in discussing a price of $900,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is persuasive, her offer of $900,000 is still significantly higher than your alternative of buying from John for $1,000,000. By rejecting her offer, you open the door for a counter-offer or can proceed with John, ensuring you don't overspend."
