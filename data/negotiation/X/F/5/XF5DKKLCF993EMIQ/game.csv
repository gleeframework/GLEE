"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay. My counteroffer is $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This would give us both a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. While I appreciate the middle ground you've suggested, I still feel that the product should align more closely with my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
