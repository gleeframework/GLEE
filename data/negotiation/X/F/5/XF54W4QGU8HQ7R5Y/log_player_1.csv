Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I think it would be a valuable addition, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value as possible without going below her minimum ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,999 leaves a small window open for Bob to feel like he might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, making the offer more appealing. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position. This allows her to price confidently with Bob."
