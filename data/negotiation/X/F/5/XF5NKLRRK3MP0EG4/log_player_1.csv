Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Offering it at $14,000 gives Bob a good deal while still securing a significant profit for me.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is my initial offer, there's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price. Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room while still staying above my minimum.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John gives me leverage. I'm not desperate, so I can confidently aim high with Bob."
