Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise: 

* It's higher than what you'd get from John, maximizing your potential profit. 
* It's lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him a potential benefit.

This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer, while still securing a good price for you."
