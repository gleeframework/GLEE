"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering what you could gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good deal, it's not the best possible outcome.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get the price lower before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a price closer to his target of $10,000, but he doesn't want to alienate Alice with an overly aggressive counteroffer.  $12,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price, and Alice's counteroffer is still higher than his desired price.  There's still room to negotiate, and Bob should try to get the price down further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $12,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a smaller counteroffer this time, aiming to show Alice he is serious about closing the deal, but still trying to get a price closer to his target.  He also emphasizes fairness to appeal to Alice's desire to make a deal."
