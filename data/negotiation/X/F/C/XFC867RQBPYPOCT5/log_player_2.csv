While $70 is a better price, we can still try to negotiate further. It's closer to John's price, but there's still a chance Alice might go lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $72. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really like the product. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $72 is a reasonable price, saving us $8 compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and secure the deal."
