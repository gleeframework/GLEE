"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You have a better option with John, so it makes sense to try negotiating with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within the realm of possibility for a deal. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still keeping the price within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target price. Remember, John is always a fallback option for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

You're increasing your offer slightly from the previous round, showing you're willing to negotiate. This offer is still well below Alice's current price, but closer to your target. This gives Alice a bit more incentive to accept while still keeping you within a reasonable price range."
