"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will generate significant returns. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000. This is a substantial discount from what it's worth to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll realize.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,200,000
* **John's Offer:** $800,000
* **Your Maximum:** $800,000

While Alice's offer might be a ""discount,"" it's still significantly higher than what John is offering, and you've stated your absolute maximum is $800,000.  There's no reason to pay more than necessary."
