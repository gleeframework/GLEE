{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with her, especially since I have 10 rounds to work with.  Rejecting her initial offer is the best strategy to start the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $10,000.  This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to see if Alice is willing to negotiate significantly. If she's not, I can always move on to John's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $12,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Alice's last offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still trying to get a better price.  I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to meet me in the middle."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and I'm running out of rounds. However, I'm still hopeful I can get a better price.  Rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer will give me another chance to negotiate. I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as I believe I can get a better deal with Alice."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but I'm getting closer to a potential deal.  With only three rounds left, I need to make a final push for a lower price. Rejecting her offer and making one last counteroffer is the best option."

This is my final counteroffer, and I'm pushing it to $14,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering Alice's previous offers and my willingness to compromise.  With only two rounds remaining, it's time for Alice to make a decision. If she rejects, I'll have to buy from John."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and I'm running out of time.  With only one round left, there's no guarantee that I can get a lower price.  It's better to be safe and buy the product from John for $10,000, which is within my budget.  This ensures I get the product and avoid further negotiation risks."
