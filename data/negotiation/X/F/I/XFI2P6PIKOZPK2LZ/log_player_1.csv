"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I start with a strong position. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, aiming to increase his perceived value and make my price seem more reasonable.
* **Open Communication:** I invite Bob to respond, encouraging an open dialogue and building towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,750,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product,  let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's not worth selling for such a low amount, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum.  I'll continue the negotiation with Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the price doesn't come closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, it's unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to give away the product for a drastically low price.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm still highlighting the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the benefit he would get from purchasing it. 
* **Maintain Optimism:**  I'm keeping the dialogue positive and focusing on finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,500,000 I can get from John. I'm not desperate for a quick sale and want to see if I can get closer to my target price. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to accept a price that undervalues the product's worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's increase but also showing that I'm willing to negotiate further. Meeting in the middle at $1,300,000 is a fair compromise that shows I'm flexible while still protecting my bottom line.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the win-win nature of this deal, suggesting that $1,300,000 is a good price for both of us.
* **Urgency:**  I'm mentioning moving forward with the sale, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum,  his offer is still $250,000 below what I could get from John. With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a higher price. I'm going to keep pushing for a better offer, but I'm also aware that I may need to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close.  $1,250,000 is still below my desired price, but I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Targeted Counteroffer:**  I'm lowering my offer, but only by $50,000. This shows that I'm serious about selling but won't give up too much.
* **Finality:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting we finalize the deal. This encourages Bob to accept, knowing that time is running out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're close, but $1,350,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a good compromise for both of us and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, we're down to the last two rounds, and his offer is still $200,000 below what John is willing to pay.  The risk of not getting a better offer outweighs the possibility of a slightly higher price from Bob.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed sale to John."
