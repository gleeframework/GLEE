# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $19,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but you need to counteroffer to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and for recognizing the value of this product. I understand your budget constraints, however, $12,000 is significantly below its true worth.  Could you consider $16,500? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $16,500 is still above your budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate.  You can try to push for a price closer to your maximum of $10,000."
