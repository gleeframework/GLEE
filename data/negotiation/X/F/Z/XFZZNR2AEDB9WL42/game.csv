"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a great product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll go with John.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,500. However, I'm not quite ready to give up on getting the full value of the product. I'm willing to go up to $11,250, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider selling to John.",11250.0,Alice,5,
