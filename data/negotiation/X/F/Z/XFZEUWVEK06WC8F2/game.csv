"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its value to me and still leaves you a healthy profit margin.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,050,000?  That's a significant discount from my original offer and still allows you a good profit margin. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay below $1,000,000. How about $990,000? That's a good compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",990000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $990,000 is tempting, it's still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to go down to $1,020,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and it leaves you with a good profit margin.  Let's make this deal happen!",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,020,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay below $1,000,000. How about $995,000? That's the best I can do, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",995000.0,Bob,6,
