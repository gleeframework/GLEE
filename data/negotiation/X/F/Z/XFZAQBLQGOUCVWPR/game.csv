"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $16,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the numerous benefits it offers. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $16,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $12,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide a great return on your investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
