"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate! Alice's offer is a bit high. We have room to bargain before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to be both assertive and respectful:

* **Assertive:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer, aiming to move the negotiation closer to our desired range.
* **Respectful:**  We acknowledge Alice's offer and express continued interest in the product. 

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $10,500 is below its true value. Could you meet me halfway at $12,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, which is good! However, $12,250 is still a bit high.  Let's see if we can nudge her closer to our target before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $11,250? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** We're increasing our offer, showing Alice we're willing to compromise. 
* **Staying strategic:**  Our new offer is a $1,000 increase from our previous offer, but still significantly below Alice's asking price and John's backup option.
* **Encouraging a deal:** By framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" we're nudging Alice towards a final agreement."
