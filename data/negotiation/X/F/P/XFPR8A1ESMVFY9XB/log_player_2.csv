Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than what John is offering and only $80,000 above Alice's minimum price, suggesting there's not much more room for negotiation. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a lower price than John without the risk of the negotiations breaking down."
