"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive deal on this high-quality product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000? I think that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $10500, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9500? I think that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $9500. How about we aim for $10000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the sale done.",10000.0,Alice,5,
