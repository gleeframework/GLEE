Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and a ""fair price,"" Alice subtly emphasizes the product's worth, potentially making Bob more amenable to a higher price. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone remains conversational (""What do you think?"") inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation.

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, so there's no risk of losing money."
