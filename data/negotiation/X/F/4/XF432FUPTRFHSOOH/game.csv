"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $1,050,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to budge from my target price just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $1,180,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",1180000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,180,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $1,120,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm sure we can close this deal.",1120000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,120,000 and $1,180,000. How about we settle on $1,150,000?
