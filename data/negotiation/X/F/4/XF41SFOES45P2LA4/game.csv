"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  How about $13,250? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this work!",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $13,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $13,250, which would be $12,875. Can you consider that?",12875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate you coming up to $12,875.  However, I'm still a bit away from my target price.  How about we split the difference one last time?  I'm willing to drop my price to $13,062.50. That's a fair compromise, and it's closer to your budget than my previous offer.  Let's try to close this deal!",13062.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $13,062.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,900, but no higher. Can you consider that?",12900.0,Bob,6,
