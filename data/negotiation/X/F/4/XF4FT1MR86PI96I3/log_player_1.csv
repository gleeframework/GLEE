``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, but I can also walk away and sell to John if Bob rejects the offer entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product's value, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to counteroffer and try to push for a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,175,000?  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still being fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to propose $1,150,000 as a compromise. This price respects the value of your product while allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  While it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000, I believe it's a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to John."
