"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay $15,000 for the product from John, and Alice is offering it at the same price, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer. There's no benefit in rejecting and going with John."
