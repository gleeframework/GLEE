"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $13,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $8,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is already a steal for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $11,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has moved up to $9,000, but it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum of $10,000. John represents a guaranteed sale at my desired price. It makes the most financial sense to cut negotiations with Bob and sell to John."
