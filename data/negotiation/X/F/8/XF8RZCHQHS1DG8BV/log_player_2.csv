"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great investment opportunity. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is far too high for Bob's budget of $8,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John for $8,000 is always an option, but it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. I think it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $10,500 is still above Bob's budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Alice will come down further.  Buying from John for $8,000 is still an option, but there's potential to save a few hundred dollars if Bob can get Alice to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is closer to what I can afford, it's still a bit high.  I'm prepared to pay $9,250 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement on this price. "", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. However, $9,250 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $10,000. I think it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice's offer is $1,000 lower than her initial offer, it's still $2,000 more than Bob's target price and $2,000 more than what John would sell it to him for. Bob is within his budget to buy from John now, but continuing the negotiation has the potential to get a better deal with Alice.  It is worth continuing the negotiation and seeing if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand we are getting closer.  $10,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. However, I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a reasonable price that is within my budget, and I hope we can reach an agreement here. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $10,250. I think it's a fair price, considering the value I've placed on the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $10,250, this is still above Bob's ideal price and only $250 less than the previous offer.  Since Bob has only 3 rounds left and John is willing to sell at $8,000, it's time to cut his losses and buy from John.  There's a good chance that Alice won't budge further, and Bob is unlikely to get a better deal.  The time constraint and the risk of losing a good deal with John justify taking the secure option and buying from John."
