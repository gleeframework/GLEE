"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiations.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,050,000?  I think that's a fair deal considering its value and my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we compromise at $1,250,000? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your budget constraints.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
