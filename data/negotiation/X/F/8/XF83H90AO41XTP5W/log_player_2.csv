Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we compromise at $1,250,000? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your budget constraints.
