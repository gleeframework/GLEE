"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,200,000 is a respectable figure, this product's value is significantly higher. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product is worth more, but I'm still not convinced that $1,800,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,400,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""

``` 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 threshold within the remaining rounds. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, making it the most logical choice at this point."
