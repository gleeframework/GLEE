Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $10,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Leaving room for negotiation and potential profit for Bob. 
* **It's a strong opening:**  Shows you're confident in the product's value. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can likely get a better price.  You have several reasons to reject his offer:

* **You've already established a higher price:** Your initial offer of $10,000 sets a precedent. Accepting a lower offer now weakens your position.
* **You have room to negotiate:** You have 8 more rounds, giving you time to see if you can secure a more profitable deal. 
* **You have a fallback option:** Selling to John for $8,000 ensures you won't lose out completely.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to counter Bob's offer with a price that's still above your minimum, but lower than your initial offer.  This shows flexibility and keeps the negotiation moving forward. You could consider something like $9,250."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I need a bit more to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  It's a fair price that's still within your budget and allows me to make a good profit."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This offer is halfway between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining your profit margin:**  The price is still well above your minimum, ensuring you make a decent profit.
* **Focusing on value:** The message emphasizes that this price is fair for both parties, highlighting the product's value. 

By making a reasonable counteroffer, you maintain control of the negotiation while showing flexibility to Bob. It keeps the negotiation moving forward and increases the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Close to your target:** $9,000 is very close to your initial desired price of $10,000 and well above your minimum of $8,000.
* **Negotiations are ongoing:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and further rounds might lead to a lower price. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **Time is limited:** You only have 6 rounds left. It's better to secure a profitable sale now rather than risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a better offer.

While you could try to counteroffer again, the risk of losing the deal entirely increases with each round.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic move at this point."
