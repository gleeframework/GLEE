Alice's offer:

While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is truly unique and justifies a higher investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  However, the  $1,100,000 offer is still significantly below what I believe is fair.  Let's settle this right now. I'm prepared to accept $1,400,000.  This is my final offer, and I think it's more than reasonable considering the value this product represents. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,400,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $1,200,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
