"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As for the price, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $8,200. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer of $7,600, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $8,100. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value the product brings to your business.",8100.0,Alice,5,
