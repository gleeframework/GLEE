"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find really useful. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $120, but I'm also aware that Bob might not be willing to pay that much. Starting at $100 allows for some room for negotiation, while still being a significant amount for Bob. I'm also including a friendly message to make the interaction more pleasant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I am still confident I can get a better price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to $95.  I am also conscious of the fact that I only have 6 rounds left before I must sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see where you're coming from. Let's try to bridge the gap.  How about we settle on $94? It's a good middle ground, and I'm sure you'll find the product is worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 94}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $92? I'm willing to stretch a bit, but I really need to stay within my budget of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with it.  I believe I can get a slightly better price if I continue negotiating. I also have 4 rounds left before I must sell to John. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $92 is still a bit low for me.  Could we meet in the middle at $93?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 93}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm really struggling to go up to $93. How about we try $91? I'm willing to make one more concession, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm running out of time, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  Although I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm prioritizing getting the best price and don't have time to continue negotiating."
