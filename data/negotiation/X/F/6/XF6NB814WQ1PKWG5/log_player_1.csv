"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $750,000}

I'm starting with a slightly discounted price to see if Bob is willing to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $700,000 because it's still not as high as I'd like. I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $725,000}

I'm making a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's previous offer, but still lower than the original price. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
