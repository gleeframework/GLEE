Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm.  $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm really interested in the product and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
