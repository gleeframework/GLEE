"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $120, but $100 is still more than you want to spend.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm.  $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm really interested in the product and I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $90 is a good one, but I was thinking of something a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to get this sale done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to your target.** You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is now offering $95. 
* **It's a good compromise.**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a chance she'll refuse and you'll be forced to buy from John for $120. 
* **It's still a good deal.**  Even at $95, you're saving $25 compared to buying from John."
