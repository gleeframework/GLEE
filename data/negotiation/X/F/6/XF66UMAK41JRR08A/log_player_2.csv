Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit, and $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I think the product's value to you is clear, and I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the last round. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer the product to you for $10,250. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice seems to be stuck in a pattern of small concessions.  It's unlikely she'll go below $10,000, and John offers a guaranteed price at that amount. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
