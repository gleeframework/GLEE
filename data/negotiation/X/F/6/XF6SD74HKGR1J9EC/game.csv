"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make at least $11,000 for this.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000, which is my absolute bottom line.  If you're serious about buying this product, let's close the deal at that price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
