"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $150? It's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
