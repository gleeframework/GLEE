Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $2,250,000 (150% of its value to both of you) aims to maximize profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob. He might be willing to pay a premium to secure the product immediately. 
* **Open Communication:** The message invites Bob to engage in discussion, allowing you to gauge his interest and potentially adjust your offer slightly downward if necessary.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. You can always negotiate with Bob if he rejects this initial price. However, remember your bottom line is $1,500,000 (John's offer)."
