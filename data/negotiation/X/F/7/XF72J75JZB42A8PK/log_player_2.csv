"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to you ($130 > $150).** 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is always an option, but it's your least desirable outcome.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for me.  How about $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your budget ($120 < $150).**
* **You've already made a counteroffer and gotten a lower price.**
* **While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your offer again and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price is high.**

Accepting Alice's offer is the most prudent choice, as it secures the product at a reasonable price within your budget."
