"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,600,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000 if possible.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for us,  $1,500,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet at $1,575,000?",1575000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your follow-up offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but unfortunately, $1,575,000 is still beyond my current budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,550,000 if that is within your consideration.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
