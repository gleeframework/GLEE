Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($120). This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a good deal for myself and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I'd love to get closer to your offer,  $105 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $110.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering with $110, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to pay $108.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $108 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter again, aiming for a price closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if we can agree."", ""product_price"": 109}
```

I'm offering $109, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows a commitment to reaching a deal while still trying to get a price closer to my target.  I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer to increase the pressure on Bob to accept."
