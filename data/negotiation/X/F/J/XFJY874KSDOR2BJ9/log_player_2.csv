"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial valuation, it's still above your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product is $8000, and I'm willing to make a further concession to get it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my maximum budget of $8,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $10,000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $10000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has again come down in price, it's still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation as the price is unlikely to drop significantly enough to meet my budget. It's better to buy from John and save $3,500."
