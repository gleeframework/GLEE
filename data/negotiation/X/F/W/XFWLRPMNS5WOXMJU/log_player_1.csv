Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price, and $1,300,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still aiming for a higher price. $1,280,000 is too close to John's offer, and I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,280,000 is still below my minimum.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $1,290,000 is tempting, it's not much better than John's offer. I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a little more."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offer is only slightly higher than John's offer.  There's a risk that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a lower price or a stalemate.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
