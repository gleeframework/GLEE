"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down a little further to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. This is a fair price that considers both our positions. Let's make this deal happen.",107.5,Alice,5,
