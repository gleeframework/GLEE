"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a good deal for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8750. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you is $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,750, which is a good price for Bob considering his maximum is $10,000. It's a fair compromise and saves Bob $1,250 compared to buying from John.  There's always a chance Bob could get a slightly better deal, but it's risky to continue negotiating with so many rounds left."
