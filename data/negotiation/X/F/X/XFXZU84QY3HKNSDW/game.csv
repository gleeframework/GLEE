"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1200000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to consider my own value for the product, which is $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1000000. This is my best offer at this time.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
