``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me some room to negotiate.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob until I reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to make a deal with him, I can't accept his current offer. I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer. I still want to get the best price possible, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my original asking price.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $1,625,000.  This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 1625000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1,625,000 is still too high for me. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'm willing to accept.  While $1,400,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I'm going to counteroffer again.  I need to find a way to bridge the gap between our offers."
