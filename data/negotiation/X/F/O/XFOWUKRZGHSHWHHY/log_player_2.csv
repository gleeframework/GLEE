# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the impact it can have on your operations, I propose a special introductory price of $12,000 for you. This offer is exclusive to you and is designed to help you maximize efficiency and profitability. I trust that you will find this investment worthwhile. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is significantly lower than her product valuation, it's still considerably higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. Rejecting this offer opens the door for further negotiation with Alice or allows you to purchase the product at a much lower price from John."
