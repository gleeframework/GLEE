# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $115. I believe this product would be very valuable to you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $105 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

$110 is a reasonable price, and it's better than buying from John for $120."
