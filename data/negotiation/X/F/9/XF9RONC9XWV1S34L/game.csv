"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me and still a good deal for you.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $850,000 is a respectable figure, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $1,100,000?  This allows me to recognize your interest while still reflecting the product's true value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your initial offer, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
