Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $9,500. I believe it presents significant value for that cost, given its potential. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be confident that I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a tempting offer, I know the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,750?"", ""product_price"": 8750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $8,200 is better than taking John's standing offer of $8,000.
