"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I believe $1,400,000 is still too high. Given the product's value to me and its worth to you, I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000. This offer is more in line with a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  The value this product holds is truly unique.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and counter at $1,300,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This reflects a significant effort to meet your needs while still staying within a reasonable range for me. I believe this offer demonstrates our commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
