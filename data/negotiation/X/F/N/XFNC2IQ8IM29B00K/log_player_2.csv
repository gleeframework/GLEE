"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's below your maximum budget, it's still far from the product's value to Alice. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so you can try to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is the fallback option.** This means you're not under pressure to accept Alice's first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I believe $1,400,000 is still too high. Given the product's value to me and its worth to you, I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000. This offer is more in line with a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  The value this product holds is truly unique.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and counter at $1,300,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a compromise, it's still above the product's worth to her.
* **You have more rounds to negotiate.** There's no need to rush into a deal.
* **Buying from John is still a viable option.** This gives you leverage to keep pushing for a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This reflects a significant effort to meet your needs while still staying within a reasonable range for me. I believe this offer demonstrates our commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
