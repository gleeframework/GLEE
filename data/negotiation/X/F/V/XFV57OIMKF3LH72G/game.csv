"I appreciate your time, Alice. However, $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $7,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,250? This would still allow me to make a decent profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we may not be able to agree on a price.  $7,800 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, as I need to ensure I can cover my costs.  What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $7,900 for the product. I'm confident that it's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",7900.0,Bob,6,
