"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $115?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $117.50?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",117.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd be willing to go up to $112.50. Can you meet me there?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $112.50 just isn't enough for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get a good value for your money.",115.0,Alice,5,

I'm not willing to go back to $115. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me there?,110.0,Bob,6,
