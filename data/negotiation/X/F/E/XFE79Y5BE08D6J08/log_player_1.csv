Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see what kind of counteroffer he might make."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my absolute minimum. I am not willing to accept it at this point.  I will counter with a price closer to my original offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,800,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still securing a price that is more favorable than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm not confident we'll reach a price that works for me.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to him."
