{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

While $85 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that low. I believe I can get a better price with further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have a backup buyer in John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about $92? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 92}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $92 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to pay $88 for it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

While $88 is close to my minimum price, we've reached a point where further negotiations are unlikely to yield a significantly higher offer from Bob. It's time to secure the guaranteed $150 from John."
