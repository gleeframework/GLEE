Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to set a high bar early on.  It's possible Bob will immediately reject this offer, but that's okay. My goal is to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he does counteroffer, I'll have a better understanding of his potential price range."
