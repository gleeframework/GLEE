Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price than Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Sense of Urgency and Value:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency and implies the product is in high demand, potentially motivating Bob to accept the higher price.
* **Fallback Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, ensuring you don't lose out.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and a realistic chance of securing a deal above your minimum acceptable price."
