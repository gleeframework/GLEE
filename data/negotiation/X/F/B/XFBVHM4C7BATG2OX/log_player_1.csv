I'll reject Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is significantly less than what I need to make. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob, but I also want to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're getting close to a deal with Bob, but I'm worried that we're running out of time.  I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low. John's offer is a safe bet, and it's still a good deal for me."
