Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially pay less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is closer to Alice's value of $80.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also aiming for a good deal.  It's a fair starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer slightly from the initial round. While it's still within my budget, I'm not willing to pay more than my initial counteroffer. I'll continue to negotiate and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer increased slightly, but I'm sticking to my initial strategy of gradually moving towards a middle ground. Increasing my counteroffer to $87 demonstrates flexibility without conceding too much. This should encourage Alice to consider a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $94

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice continues to increase her offer, which is unfavorable to me. I will reject the offer and continue negotiating.  While I am willing to pay more than my initial counteroffer, I'm still hoping to secure a better price than $94."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $89, but I want to see if Alice will budge.  We're getting closer to a deal, and this counteroffer demonstrates my commitment to closing the deal while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $96
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable. At $96, it's almost the same price as buying from John.  With only three rounds left, the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Alice is decreasing.  To avoid risking further price increases and ensure I get the product, it's best to buy from John."
