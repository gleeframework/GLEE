"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a slightly discounted rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $10,000. You have room to negotiate and try to get a better deal.  By rejecting, you open the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to get the product for closer to $8,500.  This is still a great deal for you, as it's above your stated value of $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider a middle ground. I would like to offer the product to you for $9,000. This is higher than your proposed price but lower than my initial offer, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is within your budget of $10,000 and is a fair compromise. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially raising her price again. It's also worth considering that Jhon is selling the same product for $10,000. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a slightly better price than Jhon's."
