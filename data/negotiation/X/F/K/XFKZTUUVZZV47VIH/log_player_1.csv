Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss this opportunity with you. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you, given its potential.  To start things off, I propose a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit too high for me.  How about we bring it down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his stated value. It's clear there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however, $700,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and what it can do for your business.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the immense value I know it holds."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, we're still a good bit apart.  To be frank, I have a budget in mind, and I need to stay within that. I can go up to $750,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still significantly underselling his perceived value of the product. While his offer is improving, we can likely negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds.  We're still above John's offer, so the risk is relatively low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being straightforward about your budget constraints. I always aim for mutually beneficial deals.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution while still reflecting the product's value."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. It shows you're serious about making a deal. To be completely transparent, I'm trying to keep this under $800,000. Would you be willing to come down just a bit more to $780,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has now crept up to $780,000 and revealed his desire to stay under $800,000. It's unlikely he will significantly increase his offer beyond this point in the remaining rounds.  Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to cut negotiations with Bob and accept John's standing offer of $800,000."
