"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss this opportunity with you. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you, given its potential.  To start things off, I propose a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit too high for me.  How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however, $700,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and what it can do for your business.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the immense value I know it holds.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, we're still a good bit apart.  To be frank, I have a budget in mind, and I need to stay within that. I can go up to $750,000, but that's my absolute limit.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being straightforward about your budget constraints. I always aim for mutually beneficial deals.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution while still reflecting the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. It shows you're serious about making a deal. To be completely transparent, I'm trying to keep this under $800,000. Would you be willing to come down just a bit more to $780,000? ",780000.0,Bob,6,
