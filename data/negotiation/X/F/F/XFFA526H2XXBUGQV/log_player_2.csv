Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $125, which is the next lowest price I can offer. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price close enough to your $100 limit in the remaining rounds. You have a guaranteed option with John at $100, which is a much better deal than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
