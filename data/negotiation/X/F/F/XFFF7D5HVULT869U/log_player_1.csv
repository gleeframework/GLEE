Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Here's why I chose this price:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $14,000 is higher than Bob's $8,000 valuation, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below my guaranteed value:**  I'm guaranteed $15,000 from John, so this price still leaves me room to make a profit.
* **It allows for potential negotiation:** By offering a slightly lower price than my guaranteed value, I create space for negotiation. Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his initial valuation to secure the product.

This approach maximizes my chances of selling to Bob while still securing a decent price."
