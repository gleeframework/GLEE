{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $800,000 (your guaranteed offer from John). 
* **Profit Maximization:** You want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **The Strategy:** Offering at $925,000 leaves a significant amount of value on the table for Bob ($75,000), making it very likely he'll accept.  This price also represents a substantial profit for you ($125,000 above your minimum). 

By starting with a strong but reasonable offer, you increase your chances of a quick and profitable sale to Bob."
