{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's important to remember:

* **My minimum acceptable price is $100.**  I won't sell it for less than that.
* **Bob values the product at $80.** This means there's room for negotiation, but I need to be strategic to get the best price. 
* **John is willing to pay $100.** This gives me a safety net in case I can't reach an agreement with Bob. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.** While it's closer to my goal than his initial valuation of $80, I'm not willing to settle for less than my floor price. 
* **I have a backup option with John.**  This means I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer immediately.

I'll counter with a price closer to my desired outcome, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit to $95. This is still a great price for the product, and I think it's fair considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's last offer.
* **Incentive:** By reducing my price, I'm showing I'm open to negotiation and making it more likely Bob will accept. 
* **Still profitable:**  $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Setting the stage:** By counteroffering, I'm demonstrating my willingness to work towards a deal while keeping the pressure on Bob to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $90. This is my final offer. Let me know if it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.** While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what I consider its fair value.
* **It's unclear if this is Bob's final offer.** He might be willing to negotiate further, but I don't want to give in too quickly.
* **I have a backup option with John.** I can secure the full $100 by selling to John if this negotiation falls through. 

I'll counter with a price closer to my desired outcome, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $90.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle between my previous counteroffer ($95) and Bob's current offer ($90).
* **Show Flexibility:**  By lowering my price again, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach a deal.
* **Still profitable:**  $92.50 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Final push:**  This offer puts the pressure on Bob. If he rejects this, he risks losing out on the product entirely.

Let's see if Bob will finally accept!"
