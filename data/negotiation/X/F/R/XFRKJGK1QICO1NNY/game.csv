"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $1400000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1400000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1100000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1100000 is still a bit low for me, but I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $1300000? It's a bit closer to my target, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1150000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. However, $1150000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1250000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's the best I can do.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target, Alice, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1150000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",1150000.0,Bob,8,
