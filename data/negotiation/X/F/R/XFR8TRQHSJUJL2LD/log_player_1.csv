Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
