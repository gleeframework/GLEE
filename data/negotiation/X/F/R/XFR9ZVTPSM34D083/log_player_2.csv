"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm selling a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's very competitive.  Let's talk about a price that works for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is heavily implying the product is worth much more to you than it actually is to entice you to pay a higher price. 
* You can buy the product for $15,000 from John, so there's no need to rush into Alice's offer.
* By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or stick with John if needed."
