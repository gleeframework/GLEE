"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $9,750. I think that's a fair compromise. What do you think?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm glad we're getting closer, $9,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle again and go with $10,125? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?",10125.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counter with $9,812.50. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. What do you think?",9812.5,Bob,6,
