"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. It's a fair price that reflects its value while also fitting within my financial constraints. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,300,000 represents its upper limit, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This price reflects a significant reduction on my end while still acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,075,000 is still outside my price range. Let's split the difference and aim for $962,500.  It's a compromise that shows I'm serious about buying, but I need to stay within my budget. ",962500.0,Bob,4,
