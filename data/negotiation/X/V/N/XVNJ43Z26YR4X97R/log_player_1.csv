Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for [insert a price slightly higher than $12,000, but not too much higher - maybe $12,500]. I believe it's a great value for the price, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm starting slightly above my minimum price of $12,000. This gives Bob a little room to negotiate, but still ensures I make a profit.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and focused on the value of the product. This encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:** This is just a starting point. Based on Bob's response (or lack of response), I can adjust the price or offer more information to try and close the deal. 

**Remember:**  My goal is to maximize my profit, but also to understand what Bob is willing to pay. If Bob rejects the offer, I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not in a rush to make a quick sale."
