Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I know you've been interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product but am open to hearing his perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price point. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $92.50 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $90 is a fair compromise. It's significantly higher than selling to John, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether."
