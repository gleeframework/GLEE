"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He has room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price. He has more room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal, so he'll try to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $11,000. This is a fair price that we can both be happy with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his budget limit, and Alice is also close to her bottom line.  The difference is now small, but Bob is still hoping to save a little more. He'll try one more counteroffer to see if he can get a slightly better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,250 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to offer $11,100.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,100 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $11,200. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached his limit.  He's only willing to pay $11,000 maximum, and Alice is not willing to go lower than $11,200.  It's clear that they won't be able to reach an agreement.  To avoid further rounds of negotiation and potential deadlock, Bob decides to buy the product from John for $10,000.  This is the best option for him as it guarantees he gets the product within his budget."
