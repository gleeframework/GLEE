"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $10000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $11000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11500. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. Let's make this deal happen!",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $11500, which would be $11250. Can you consider that?",11250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $11200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $11200?",11200.0,Bob,8,
