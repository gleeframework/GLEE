"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13250.0,Alice,3,
