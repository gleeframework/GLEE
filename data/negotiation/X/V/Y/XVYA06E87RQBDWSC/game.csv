"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go at this time.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for us both.  My final offer is $950,000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it's more than fair given the value you'll gain.",950000.0,Alice,5,
