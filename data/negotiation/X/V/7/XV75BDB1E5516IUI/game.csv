"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,400,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,575,000? This price still represents a good value for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1575000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $1,575,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,500,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
