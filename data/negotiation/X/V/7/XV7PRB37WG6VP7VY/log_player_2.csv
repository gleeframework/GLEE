# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above my maximum budget. It's a good starting point to negotiate, but I need to bring the price down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This recognizes the product's worth while also finding a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my target. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can bring the price down further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
