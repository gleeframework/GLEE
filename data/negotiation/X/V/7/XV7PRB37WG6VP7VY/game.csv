"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This recognizes the product's worth while also finding a compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
