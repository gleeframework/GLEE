"Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a little low for what I had in mind, I'm willing to come down to $175 to make this happen.  What do you say?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $137.50?  This seems like a fair deal for both of us.",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and land at $156? This gets us closer to a fair deal.",156.0,Alice,5,
