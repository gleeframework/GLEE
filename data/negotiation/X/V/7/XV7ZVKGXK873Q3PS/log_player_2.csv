Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a little low for what I had in mind, I'm willing to come down to $175 to make this happen.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my maximum budget of $100. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $137.50?  This seems like a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 137.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and land at $156? This gets us closer to a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $156. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $156
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still higher than my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, it's getting close to the end of our allotted rounds.  It's more likely that I'll be able to get a better deal by buying from John now, who is already offering the product for my target price of $100."
