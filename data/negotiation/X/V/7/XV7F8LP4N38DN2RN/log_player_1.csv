Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm going to start high, aiming for a profit.  $1,500,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.  I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a compromise and accept.  I'm also keeping in mind John's offer, as I can always go with him if Bob continues to be unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price.  I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer.  I'm getting close to John's offer, but I'm going to try to squeeze a little more out of Bob.  I need to make sure I get as close as possible to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a smaller drop than before, but still within my minimum price range. I believe this is a fair price, considering Bob's willingness to negotiate. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer, as I don't want to keep going back and forth for a small difference."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough decision!  Bob's offer is exactly my minimum price. It's tempting to go with John for the same price, but there's a chance I could still get more from Bob. However, I've already made several counteroffers and his offers haven't been getting higher.  I'm worried that if I reject this offer, he might not come back with anything better.  I'm going to take the $1,200,000 from Bob, and finally secure the sale."
