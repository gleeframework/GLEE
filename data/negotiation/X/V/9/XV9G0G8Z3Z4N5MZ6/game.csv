"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value it brings to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm still a little hesitant at $11,500. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you halfway this time, Bob. I think $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value I know the product has for you. I can offer it to you for $12,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",12250.0,Alice,7,
