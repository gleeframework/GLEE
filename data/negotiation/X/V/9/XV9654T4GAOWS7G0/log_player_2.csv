"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While buying from John immediately would guarantee getting the product, there's no reason to do so in the first round.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both of us, there's potential for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer,  $100,000 less than Alice's initial price,  demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while setting a clear starting point. This offers a good chance of  Alice counter-offering  closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our initial counteroffer, but there's still room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer allows for another counteroffer with the goal of getting closer to our desired price.  Buying from John is not necessary yet, as further negotiation has the potential to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're trying to split the difference between our last offer and Alice's current offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming to get a better price.  This counteroffer is a good middle ground, likely pushing Alice to make a final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our desired price. Accepting this offer saves $25,000 compared to buying from John and demonstrates a willingness to close the deal.  While further negotiation could potentially save even more, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers or John changing his price is too high. It's best to secure this deal now."
