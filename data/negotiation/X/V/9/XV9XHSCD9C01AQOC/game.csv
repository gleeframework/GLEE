"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $11,000, Bob. But I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10,800? It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it to get a deal done. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,

"I'm sorry to hear that $10,000 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $10,500? It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it to get a fair price for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
