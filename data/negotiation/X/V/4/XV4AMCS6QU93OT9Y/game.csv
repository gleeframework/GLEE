"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic product, and I'm confident it's worth more to you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  This would give you a great deal, and allow me to achieve my goals. Let's make this work.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my desired price, but I still need to get a bit higher to make this work.  How about $1,300,000? This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
