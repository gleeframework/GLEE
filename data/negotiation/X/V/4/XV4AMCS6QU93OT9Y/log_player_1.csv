"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to get. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic product, and I'm confident it's worth more to you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  This would give you a great deal, and allow me to achieve my goals. Let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have several rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe I can potentially get a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my desired price, but I still need to get a bit higher to make this work.  How about $1,300,000? This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
