"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with its value and reflects the benefits it will bring to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $880,000. This is a serious offer that demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work. What do you say?",880000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that we've reached a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $960,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and my requirements. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",960000.0,Alice,5,
