"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  While it's a lower price than the product's worth to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's in Bob's best interest to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with its value and reflects the benefits it will bring to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal budget. Bob should continue negotiating. It's possible that Alice might be willing to go lower, and there's still room to make a counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $880,000. This is a serious offer that demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 880000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that we've reached a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $960,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and my requirements. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $960,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's desired price point. While it's closer than previous offers, Bob is approaching the point where the potential savings from continued negotiation are no longer worth the risk of Alice rejecting further offers.  Buying from John for $800,000 guarantees Bob the product within his budget."
