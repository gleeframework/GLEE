"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but not too high that it's immediately a dealbreaker. I'm also emphasizing that I'm open to negotiation, which hopefully encourages him to counter-offer and start a back-and-forth dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $130?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to go down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}

While $125 is my minimum, I'm going to try to hold out for a bit more.  There are still a few rounds left, and I'm hoping to get closer to $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130? This is a great price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get at least $130. With only four rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm really trying to make this work, but $125.50 just isn't going to cut it for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $128. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 128}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time. Bob is clearly not willing to budge much further, and I'm still not comfortable with his offer. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $150 from John."
