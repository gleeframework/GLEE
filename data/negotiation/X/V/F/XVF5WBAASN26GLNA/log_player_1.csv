"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high with $15,000.  This is a strong opening offer that reflects the value of the product to me. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low for me. It's below my minimum value and I want to try to get closer to my initial price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm coming down from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob. It's a compromise, but I'm still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's higher than what John is offering, and it's a good compromise considering we are already in round 4. I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob entirely."
