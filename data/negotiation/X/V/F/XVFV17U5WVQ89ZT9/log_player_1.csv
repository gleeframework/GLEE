Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is more than your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still room for Bob to counteroffer and for you to potentially increase the price.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $11,500 is still less than what Bob is willing to pay, increasing the chances of him accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth pushing for a better price.  Here's why:

* **Potential for higher profit:**  You know Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's still room to negotiate a price closer to that.
* **Limited risk:** Rejecting Bob's offer doesn't mean you'll lose the deal completely. You can counteroffer, and you have the safety net of selling to John if negotiations fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, you increase your chances of earning closer to the product's true value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my original price point.  How about $11,000? That would still give you a good deal and be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reasonably high:** $11,000 is still significantly more than John's offer and closer to your ideal profit margin.
* **Compromise:** It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a firm position. 
* **Positive language:**  The message emphasizes the deal's value for Bob while making the counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position.  Could we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** $10,750 is only $750 less than your minimum acceptable price, making it a financially viable option.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** If you reject this offer, there's no guarantee that Bob will counteroffer again, and you might be stuck with John's lower offer.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation might take longer and involve more back-and-forth, which could be time-consuming.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a reasonable profit, minimizes risk, and avoids potential delays in the negotiation process."
