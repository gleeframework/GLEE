"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?
