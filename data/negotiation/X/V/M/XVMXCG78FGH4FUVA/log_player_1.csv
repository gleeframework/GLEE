Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Considering its value and potential, I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000 and we have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, starting with a higher price leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value to justify the high price, potentially piquing Bob's interest.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning a limited-time offer and exclusivity, we aim to create a sense of urgency and scarcity, prompting Bob to decide quickly. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Best-case scenario. We earn a significant profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:** This opens the door for us to potentially meet somewhere in the middle, still earning more than our guaranteed $15,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** We proceed with selling the product to John for our guaranteed $15,000."
