"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going right now.  I'm willing to offer you $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
