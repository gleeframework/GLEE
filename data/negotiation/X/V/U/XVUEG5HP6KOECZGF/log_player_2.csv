Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above your budget. You should reject the offer and continue to negotiate. You can likely secure a better price closer to your target of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, lowering her price. You should offer a price slightly higher than your maximum price with John. This shows that you are serious about buying the product, but still want a good deal.  It is likely Alice will accept this offer as she's already come down significantly and is probably willing to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's price is coming down, it's still above your budget.  You should continue negotiating, aiming to get closer to your target price of $800,000.  Alice is likely willing to go lower, especially as you've shown persistence in negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's still holding out for a higher price. You should raise your offer slightly from your previous counteroffer, demonstrating that you are serious about buying the product.  This offer is still within your budget, and it may be enough to convince Alice to accept."
