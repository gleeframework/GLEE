"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is your maximum, there's no reason to immediately accept Alice's offer.  We don't know her minimum price, so there's potential to save money by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount.  This aggressive approach might force Alice to reveal her lower price point and gives us more negotiating room in the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm not willing to accept yet as I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming to close the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to push for a lower price, but moving my counteroffer closer to Alice's last offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still trying to secure a good deal.  The goal is to reach a mutually acceptable price quickly and avoid going through all 10 rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is a significant price decrease from her initial offer and closer to my counteroffer.  Accepting this offer saves me $2,000 compared to buying from John.  While I might be able to negotiate further, the potential savings are decreasing, and the risk of losing the deal increases with each round. It's time to secure the deal and save the most money possible."
