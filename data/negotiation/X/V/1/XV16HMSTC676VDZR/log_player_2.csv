"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a special opportunity tailored to your needs and expectations, considering its value to you is $15,000. I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm looking to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value we both place on it.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that considers both the value you place on the item and my need to maximize the return on this investment. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than John's price:**  $13,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $15,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, it's likely Alice will be less willing to budge further. 
* **Saving money is the priority:** Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John."
