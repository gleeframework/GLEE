"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the price he can get from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to John's offer as possible. By offering $1,250,000, Bob shows a willingness to negotiate but also demonstrates that he's aware of the market value. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while still keeping the price within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob can get from John. While it is slightly lower than her initial offer, it's still not a good deal for Bob. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue to try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. However, he's still staying below John's price, making this a good strategy to potentially secure a deal while saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer in Round 5 has increased again, moving further away from Bob's target price. It's clear that Alice is not willing to come down significantly from her initial asking price.  With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a favorable agreement with Alice is increasing.  

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he knows he can secure the product for $1,200,000 from John. It's a guaranteed deal that aligns with his budget and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
