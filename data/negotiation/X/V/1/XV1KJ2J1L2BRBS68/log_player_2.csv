Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $500,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects the product's worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This offer stands as a testament to my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $700,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a fair deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that makes sense for you. Her final offer of $1,600,000 is still far too high.  You can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is a much better deal."
