"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential ROI. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a significantly lower price? I'd be willing to pay $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $500,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects the product's worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This offer stands as a testament to my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,900,000 is closer to a reasonable range, it's still a bit too high for me. I could go up to $700,000. That's a significant investment on my end, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $700,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
