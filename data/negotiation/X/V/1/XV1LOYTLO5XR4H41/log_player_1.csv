Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal for you and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This is a good starting point as it offers a fair price to Bob, leaving room for negotiation if he is willing to pay more. At the same time, it ensures that you make a profit above your minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something around $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still below the value you've set for yourself. Rejecting his offer allows you to try and get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's still a great price for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $90 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $87.50? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to your minimum price of $80 and still allows you to make a profit. While you could potentially continue to negotiate, the risk of him rejecting your counteroffer and ultimately selling to John for $80 outweighs the potential gain from a higher price."
