Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  How about $9,000? This would still give you a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.
