{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident this is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** You're already securing a profit of $400,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has incentive to negotiate, knowing the product is worth more to him.
* **It shows confidence:** You're not starting low and appearing desperate. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is still a good profit for me, it's worth seeing if I can push for a better price. I'm confident the product is worth more to Bob, and he seems willing to pay a premium.  I'll try to negotiate a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to $1,150,000 to make this deal work for me. This price still gives you a significant benefit and ensures a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** I'm willing to compromise but not give away too much.
* **Reiterates the value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to him.
* **Keeps the negotiation going:**  It encourages Bob to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,080,000? This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,080,000 is still a substantial profit and a good deal overall. There's always a risk Bob will reject my counteroffer, and I could end up selling to John for a lower price.  It's time to accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
