"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. Can you meet me halfway?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to $1,150,000 to make this deal work for me. This price still gives you a significant benefit and ensures a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,080,000? This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
