Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you reconsider?

Bob is unlikely to move much higher and we're reaching the point where the potential profit isn't worth the risk of continued negotiation. John offers a guaranteed $100, which is a better outcome than potentially settling for less with Bob."
