"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $2,000,000 for you.  This offer stands as a sign of good faith in hopes of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $2,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? That's my final offer.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
