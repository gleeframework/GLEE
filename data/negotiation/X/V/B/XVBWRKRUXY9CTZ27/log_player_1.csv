"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $15,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping it's attractive enough for Bob to accept.  I'm also trying to gauge how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $9,000 is still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway at $11,000. This is a fair price considering both our previous offers, and I hope it's enough to persuade him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but they're still not high enough. With only 4 rounds left, I'm worried I won't get a better offer. I'm going to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
