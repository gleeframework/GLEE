# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer again.  While it's a bit closer to his target, there's still room to negotiate.  He can try to get a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $850,000."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already gotten a price lower than his initial goal, and further negotiation may not yield a significantly better price.  The risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ending up buying from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price from Alice."
