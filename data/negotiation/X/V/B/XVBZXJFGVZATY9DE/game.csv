"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking to secure a price that reflects the product's true value to me. I'm happy to offer $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",875000.0,Bob,4,
