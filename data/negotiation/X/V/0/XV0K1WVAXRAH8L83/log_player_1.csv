{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to the $1,000,000 value Bob sees, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation.  This strategy allows for potential back and forth to see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to reassess and consider a lower offer or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum target of $800,000.  I'm going to counteroffer Bob to try and find a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Although $875,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a significant improvement over the $800,000 I would get from John.  Since Bob has indicated this is his final offer, I'm going to accept it. This secures a better deal for me while still allowing Bob to get the product at a price he feels is fair."
