"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I know it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still below its true worth. I'm confident you won't find this kind of deal anywhere else.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
