"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",1100000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we settle at $1,000,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,,
