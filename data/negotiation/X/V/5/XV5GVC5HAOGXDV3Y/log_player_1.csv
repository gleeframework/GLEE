Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is above Bob's valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I'm confident that I can get at least $1,200,000 from John if I need to, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or John, so I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to $950,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a good price for me and closer to my target. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I believe I can secure a better deal with either Bob or John. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm offering $925,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. It's still within my acceptable range, and hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
