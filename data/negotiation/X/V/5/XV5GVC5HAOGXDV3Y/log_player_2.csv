"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial valuation, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. He knows he can buy the product from John for $800,000. By offering $850,000, Bob is starting the negotiation at a price point that is still within his budget but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This gives Alice room to negotiate while also demonstrating that Bob is serious about getting a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $950,000, which is closer to Bob's desired range but still too high. Bob should continue negotiating.  He has a clear alternative with John, so there's no rush to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $800,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $950,000. A counteroffer of $900,000 is a reasonable compromise, moving both parties closer to their desired price.  This shows Bob is serious about buying from Alice while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is only $25,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer.  Considering that Bob can buy the product from John for $800,000, it's worth it to accept this offer. Bob saves $75,000 compared to buying from John, and the negotiation has reached a point where further counteroffers might be unlikely to result in a significantly lower price."
