"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,500,000 and Alice's initial offer is also $1,500,000, there's no room for negotiation.  You're better off buying from John, as you're guaranteed to get the product at your maximum price. There's no benefit to trying to negotiate with Alice."
