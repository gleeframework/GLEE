**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm and her ""final offer"" is still significantly above your guaranteed option with John.  While you *might* be able to negotiate her down further, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her price or the potential stress of further negotiation. You've already secured a good price by having John as a backup."
