Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm not going all the way down to $15,000 (John's offer) right away. This gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal and incentivizes him to counteroffer. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone (""Let me know what you think!"") can build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's a higher offer than Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly below what I want to get for the product. 
* **I have a guaranteed higher offer from John.** Selling to John means I can secure a higher profit.
* **More negotiation room.** Rejecting Bob's offer gives me a chance to make a counteroffer that might be more agreeable. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can bring him closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which I think is a fair compromise.  It's a significant amount for you, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and shows that I'm taking his position into consideration.
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm highlighting the fact that my counteroffer is still a substantial amount for Bob, reminding him of the value he'll be getting from the product.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language like ""common ground"" to maintain a friendly and collaborative tone. 
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm not settling for Bob's original offer, but I'm also not going straight to John's offer. This gives Bob another chance to counteroffer while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While he's come up from $9,000, $9,500 is still a significant distance from my ideal price and not worth the risk of further negotiation.
* **John's offer guarantees a higher profit.** I've already established a guaranteed buyer who's willing to pay my minimum asking price. 
* **Time is a factor.**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee he'll eventually agree to a price I'm happy with.

It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. I can get a better price and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
