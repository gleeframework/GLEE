,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which I think is a fair compromise.  It's a significant amount for you, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
