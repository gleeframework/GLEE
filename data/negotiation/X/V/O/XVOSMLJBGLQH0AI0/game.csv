"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a strong offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to negotiating further if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $650,000?  I think that's a fair starting point for further discussion.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $725,000?  I feel that's a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the value of the product.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
