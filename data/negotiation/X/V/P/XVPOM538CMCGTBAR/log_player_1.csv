Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than your initial assessment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, trying to get Bob to buy at a higher price is worth a shot. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still potentially attractive compared to losing the deal entirely. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** The message creates a sense of urgency by mentioning other interested parties. This might push Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

This strategy involves a degree of risk. If Bob rejects the offer, I'm guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. However, there's a chance Bob might find $1,400,000 acceptable, leading to a higher profit."
