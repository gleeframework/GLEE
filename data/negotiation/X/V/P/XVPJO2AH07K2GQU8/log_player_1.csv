Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as much as possible, but I know Bob won't pay more than $100. 
* **Attractive Offer:** $125 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($100) but still below my minimum ($150).
* **Negotiation Room:** This leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can sell to John for my minimum price. 

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a higher profit than selling to John directly."
