"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the starting point.  I'm interested, but  $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Let's start at $10,000, and we can see where things go from there.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to offer you a compromise at $10,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $10,400. This would give us both a fair deal, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase.",10400.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,400. I'm willing to offer you a revised price of $10,600. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value and quality.",10600.0,Alice,5,
