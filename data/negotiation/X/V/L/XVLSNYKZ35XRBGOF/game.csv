"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a fair price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,000,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen to acquire the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be a fair price. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value I have in mind for the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $700,000? This would be a mutually beneficial deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $950,000. This is the best I can do at this point.",950000.0,Alice,5,
