"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000, a price that I believe is a fair compromise between what it's worth to me and what it's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is less than the $12,000 you'd pay John.
* **You're still getting a good deal:**  The product is worth $12,000 to you, and you're getting it for $10,000. This is a savings of $2,000.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous decision."
