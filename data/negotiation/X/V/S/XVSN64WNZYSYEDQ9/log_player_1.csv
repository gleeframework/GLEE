Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""significant value,"" I'm hinting that the product is worth a premium, even though I don't explicitly state why Bob should value it above $10,000.
* **Open-ended Question:** ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This is a single-round negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I have a guaranteed backup offer.
* This strategy aims to maximize profit, knowing that I have a safety net with John."
