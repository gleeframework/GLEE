"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I need to stay firm on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too far away from the original price I had in mind. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not convinced that $1050000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting too far away from my original asking price.

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm going to have to pass on your offer and consider other options. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $1500000, and I think it's a great opportunity. If you're willing to meet me at $1000000, I'll reconsider selling it to you. Otherwise, I'll have to move forward with John's offer.",1000000.0,Alice,9,
