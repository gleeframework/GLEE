"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $22,000.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way out of my budget.  I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $6,000 is significantly below its value.  I could come down to $18,000,  This is a very fair offer considering its benefits.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you meet me halfway at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  How about $14,000?  This is a significant price reduction, and I'm confident it's a fair deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to consider $10,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. I believe this is my final offer as it's a significant compromise on my end.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I can't justify going above $11,000. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,8,
