"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. I believe it's a great product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $10500. This is still a great deal considering the product's value and quality.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not sure I can get to $10500. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand this is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",10800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make one last concession, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $10000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. Can we finalize the sale at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10200. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",10200.0,Alice,9,

"I've made my final offer, Alice. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from another seller. I'm not willing to go any higher.",10000.0,Bob,10,
