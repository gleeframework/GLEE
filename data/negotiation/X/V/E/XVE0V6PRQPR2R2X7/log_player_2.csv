# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. Would you like to consider purchasing it for $1,200,000?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than you'd like, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, which is a compromise from my minimum price of $1,200,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and this price is a good deal compared to John's offer.  Taking it now guarantees you get the product and avoids potentially missing out."
