"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. Would you like to consider purchasing it for $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than you'd like, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the very top of my budget. If you're willing to come down to that, I'll take it.  Otherwise, I may have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, which is a compromise from my minimum price of $1,200,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value.",990000.0,Alice,5,
