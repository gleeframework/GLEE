"Hi Bob, I have a great product I'd like to offer you. It's a high-quality item that I think you'll really like. I'm looking to sell it to you for $180. Is this something you'd be interested in?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to come down to $120?  This is my maximum budget for this type of item.  Let me know what you think!",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'd like to make a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $150. Would you be interested in that price?",150.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $150 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  Would you consider $130?  It's a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",130.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit above your budget, but I'd like to make another compromise. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
