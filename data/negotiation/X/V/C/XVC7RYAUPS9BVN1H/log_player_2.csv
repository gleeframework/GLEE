"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is less than the $15,000 John wants. 
* **You're still getting a good deal:** You value the product at $15,000, so even paying $12,000 is a saving."
