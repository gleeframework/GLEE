It's always good to see if you can get a better price.  $120 is a good starting point, but let's see if we can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering $100. That's a significant discount from her initial offer, but still a fair price for a product I value at $150.  Let's see if she's willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice is coming down, but I'm still not at my target price.  Let's see if we can squeeze out another few dollars."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to offer $105. This is a compromise, but still gets us closer to my desired price.  Let's see if Alice is willing to meet in the middle."

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and we're close to my target. Accepting this offer saves me $42 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal!"
