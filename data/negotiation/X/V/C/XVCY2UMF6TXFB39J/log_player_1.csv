Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $15,000 allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It's easier to come down from a higher starting point.
* **Justifying the Price:**  The message vaguely hints at the product's value (""Given its value..."") to make Bob feel like he might be getting a good deal even if it's above his perceived value.

**Important Note:**  While Bob's perceived value is $8,000, he might be willing to pay a bit more if he believes the product is scarce or if there's a strong reason for him to acquire it immediately."
