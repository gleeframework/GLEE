Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, we don't want to scare him away with an offer too close to that.  Offering it at $1,100,000 allows for a significant profit margin while still leaving Bob with a potential $100,000 gain.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net. This knowledge allows us to aim higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a fair reflection of that value, rather than just a random number."
