Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to my value of $8,000. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a fair price, considering both our positions and leaves room for us to reach an agreement. What do you say?

I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not there. I want to see if I can push him a bit further. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable dropping to $9,500.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my value.  I'm willing to offer $9,750. This is a good compromise that recognizes your need for a fair price and my desire to save money. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  It's getting close to my minimum price, and I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, I may not be able to get a better price from him.  Additionally, I'm worried that I might run out of rounds and be forced to sell to John at a lower price."
