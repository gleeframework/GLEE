Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. It's also a price that shows I value the product highly, potentially making Bob more motivated to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, it's close enough to his budget that he'll accept, while still getting me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price,  $1,250,000 is a solid profit and a good outcome considering the negotiation so far.  It's also significantly more than selling to John, so it's the best choice at this point."
