"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me.  However, $10,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. However, $8,500 is significantly below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $9,000.  It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product.  It's a fair price that's closer to my budget. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
