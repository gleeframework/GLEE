Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, we want to see if we can get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * **For Bob:** He gets the product for $50,000 less than its value to him.
    * **For Alice:** She makes a profit of $150,000, which is more than the guaranteed $0 profit if she went straight to John. 

This initial offer tests Bob's willingness to pay a premium while still leaving room for potential negotiation."
