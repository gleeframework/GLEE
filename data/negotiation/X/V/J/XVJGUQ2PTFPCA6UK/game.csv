"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe is truly exceptional. It's worth more than $120 to us, but I'd like to start our negotiation at $150. This includes not only the quality of the product but also our commitment to providing excellent customer service. What do you think about this starting point?",150.0,Alice,1,
