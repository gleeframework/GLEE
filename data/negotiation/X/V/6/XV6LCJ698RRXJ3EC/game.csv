"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to propose an alternative. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750 for the product? This respects your budget while still allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",12750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $12,750 is closer, I'm still aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground. Considering your budget constraints, how about we set the product price at $12,250? This is higher than my initial offer but still lower than my previous counteroffer, aiming for a compromise that works for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,5,
