"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price. You have a good chance of success because you know she values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for both of you to gain."

Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1,050,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $1,175,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's worth and reflects the value it will bring to your business. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,175,000 is still above my budget of $1,000,000.  However, it's closer than her initial offer, and I want to see if I can push her down further. I'll try another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my maximum budget."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer of $1,100,000. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer you a counteroffer of $1,125,000. This price is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,125,000 is still above my budget of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already made multiple counteroffers and there's a good chance Alice won't budge further. It's not worth risking further negotiation, as I could potentially lose the opportunity to purchase the product from John for a price I can afford."
