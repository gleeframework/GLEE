"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its worth, I'm initially offering it for $10,000.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to pay $7,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
