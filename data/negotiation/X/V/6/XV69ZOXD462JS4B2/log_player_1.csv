Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,500. This is a price that is:

* **Higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000** - ensuring I get a good deal.
* **Lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000** - giving him a good deal and making him more likely to accept.

By offering a price in the middle, I maximize my chances of both selling the product to Bob (earning more money) and still ensuring I get a better deal than selling to John."
