"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I'm asking for $200 for it. I think you'll agree it's a steal at this price."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your generosity. However, considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to go above his maximum valuation of $120. While he offered $150, it's unlikely he'll go any higher. Accepting his offer nets me less than selling to John.  It's in my best interest to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
