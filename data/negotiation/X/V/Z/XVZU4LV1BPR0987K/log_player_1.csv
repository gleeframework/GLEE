"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a strong opening position. It allows for negotiation and gives me some room to lower the price if necessary.  While I want to maximize profit, I'm also aware that I can walk away with $8,000 from John if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe I can do better than that. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go higher. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for the bare minimum right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves room for further negotiation. I'm confident that Bob values the product more than $8,000, and I'm hoping this counteroffer will motivate him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $8,500. While it's not my ideal price, it's a significant improvement from his initial offer and is closer to my desired value.  I'm going to accept this offer and sell the product to Bob. It's a good compromise, and I can move on from this negotiation."
