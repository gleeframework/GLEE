Alice's offer:

This reflects the significant value the product brings to your business, and it's still a fair price considering its capabilities. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $725,000.  The product's value and the potential it offers your business justify a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and unlock the potential of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000.  It's better to secure the product at John's price of $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
