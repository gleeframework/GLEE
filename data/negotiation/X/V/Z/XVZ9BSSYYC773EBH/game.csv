"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only justify spending up to $650,000. Would that work for you?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $650,000 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to facilitate a deal. This reflects the significant value the product brings to your business, and it's still a fair price considering its capabilities. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $900,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could you consider $725,000?  That's a significant investment for me but would allow me to bring in this product.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $725,000.  The product's value and the potential it offers your business justify a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and unlock the potential of this product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
