Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum price of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also considering the potential of selling to John for $10,000, so I don't want to set the price too high and risk losing Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,200. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay more than $10,800 but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, while also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my initial offer, and I'm getting closer to my minimum price.  However, there is still a risk that he will continue to lower his offer in the next round. At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John for $10,000 and guarantee a sale rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
