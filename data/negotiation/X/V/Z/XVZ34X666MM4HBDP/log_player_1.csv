Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's in excellent condition and would be a great asset to your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation, ensuring a potentially profitable outcome while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, I think $11,000 is a bit high. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I'm sure you'll find this to be a fair price considering the value the product offers."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to $10,000, Alice.  How about $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is close to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit while minimizing the chances of ending up with the lower price from John."
