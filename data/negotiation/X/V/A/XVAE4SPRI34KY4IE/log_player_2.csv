"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are aiming to save as much money as possible. 
* $100 is still a significant amount compared to your $120 maximum.
* It's worth seeing if you can get a better price from Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's original price. 
* This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal, and it leaves room for negotiation.
* If Alice rejects this offer, I can still adjust my counteroffer in the following rounds, but I want to start strong."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $90 is still a bit high compared to my target. 
* I'm confident I can push for a lower price with further negotiation, as she has already lowered her offer once.
* It's worth seeing if I can get even closer to my $80 target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer slightly to $85. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* $85 is still within my budget and a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.
* I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, as it's closer to her previous counteroffer. However, I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
