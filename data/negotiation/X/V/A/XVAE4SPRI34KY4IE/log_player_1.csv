"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point considering my minimum value is $80. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is my minimum, I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm countering with $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for profit.  It also shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but won't give away the product for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, and I'm not sure I can get a significantly better offer in the remaining rounds. I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $85."
