"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its worth and value. Would you like to buy it from me for $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so it's likely worth even more to me. I can get it from John for $800,000, which is a much better deal.
