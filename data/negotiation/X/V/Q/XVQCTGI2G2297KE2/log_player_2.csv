"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal to you. How about a price of $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Alice is offering it for $110. While this is a good deal, it's still above your ideal price point. You can get the product for your maximum price from John, so it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
