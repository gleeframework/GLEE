Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal to you. How about a price of $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Starting with a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) increases the chances of securing a higher profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $110, there might be a slight possibility for Bob to negotiate down, still landing you a price higher than your alternative with John. 

By offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value, Alice increases her chances of getting the best possible deal while ensuring she doesn't lose the sale entirely."
