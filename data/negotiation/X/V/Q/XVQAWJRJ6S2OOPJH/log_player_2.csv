"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product.  Alice's offer of $115 is too high.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $117.5 is still higher than what you'd ideally like to pay, but it's closer to your maximum limit of $120. Since you're already in negotiations and it's likely Alice won't go lower than this, accepting the offer is the best choice. It saves you money compared to buying from John and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds that might not yield a better result."
