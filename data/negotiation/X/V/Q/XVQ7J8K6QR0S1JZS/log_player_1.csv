Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

This is my initial offer to Bob. It's a significant markup over my minimum acceptable price, giving him room to negotiate. I'm hoping to leverage the fact that I don't know the value of the product to him, but I'm still confident in my ability to secure a good price. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll keep the possibility of selling to John in the back of my mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still do better. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'll aim for a price that's still within a reasonable range for Bob, but also reflects the value of the product to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,700,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer, and it gives him a little more wiggle room while still being closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good compromise. While it's lower than my initial goal, it's still a solid profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a significantly lower price."
