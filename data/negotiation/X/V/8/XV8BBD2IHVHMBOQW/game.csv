"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find the product is worth it.",11250.0,Alice,3,
