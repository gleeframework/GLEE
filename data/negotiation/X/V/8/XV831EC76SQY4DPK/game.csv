"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $8,500. It's my best offer so far, and I think it's a great value for the product",8500.0,Alice,5,
