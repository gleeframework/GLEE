,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you outlining the value you see in this product. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
