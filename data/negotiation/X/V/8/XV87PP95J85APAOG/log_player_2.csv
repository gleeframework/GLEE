"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something truly special, and I believe it's worth $1750000. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to see if you can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds great, but $1,750,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  This is my best offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($1,400,000 vs $1,750,000) shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and are willing to walk away.
* **Clear Message:**  The message explicitly states your budget constraint and makes your offer clear.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $1,400,000 is your best offer, it leaves room for Alice to counter without exceeding your budget.
* **Focus on Value:**  Mentioning that the product ""sounds great"" acknowledges the value without fully accepting Alice's initial assessment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about $1600000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget, but closer.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can meet in the middle. You have 7 rounds left, so there's still time to find a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and it's the absolute maximum I can spend. Let me know if you're willing to accept it."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Stating it's your ""final offer"" adds pressure, making Alice aware that further negotiation might lead to you walking away.
* **Maximum Budget:** Explicitly mentioning it's your ""absolute maximum"" reinforces your budget constraint.
* **Meet in the Middle:** You've moved closer to Alice's price, showing good faith and increasing the chances of reaching an agreement. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Mentioning the product's value again acknowledges its worth without agreeing to a price that exceeds your budget."
