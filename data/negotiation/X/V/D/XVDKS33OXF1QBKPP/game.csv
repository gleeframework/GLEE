"Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $125. This is still a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!",125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, $125 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
