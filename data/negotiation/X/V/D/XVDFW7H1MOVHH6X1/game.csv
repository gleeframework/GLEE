"I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My revised offer is $1,000,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle somewhat, but that price is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we try to bridge the gap a bit more?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $725,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. My revised offer is $900,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and your initial offer of $650,000.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm getting closer to a price point I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. However, $775,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about the value I'm bringing to the table. My revised offer is $875,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional support and services to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,7,
