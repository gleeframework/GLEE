"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I have to consider the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $925,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, which is $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've invested in negotiations.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price if we keep working together. I'm going to offer $880,000. This is a firm offer, and I'm hoping it shows my commitment to reaching a deal. Let's close this deal.",880000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant concession to try to close the deal. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $915,000. This is my final offer, and I hope it's acceptable to you.",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal, but $915,000 is still beyond my budget.  Since this is my final offer, I'm going to offer you $890,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our back-and-forth negotiation. Let's make this happen!",890000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $890,000. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.
