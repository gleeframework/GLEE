""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire it at a price below your valuation."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high doesn't mean Bob will immediately accept. It allows for potential counter-offers and finding a middle ground.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position, allowing her to be more ambitious with Bob.

By offering the product at $1,450,000, Alice aims to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
