"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you, considering its value to you is $10,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can likely get a better deal by counteroffering. He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your understanding of its value to me. While I'm interested, $9,500 is a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I would like to propose a price of $9,200. This offers a compromise that respects the value you see in the product while allowing us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, $9,200 is a good deal for him, considering he's willing to pay up to $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price."
