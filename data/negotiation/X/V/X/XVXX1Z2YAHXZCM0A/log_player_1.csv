"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a high price, but one that is still potentially appealing to Bob as it's significantly less than my minimum value. 
* This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while also maximizing my potential profit. 
* If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my strategy for the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000.  
*  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.  
* I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, so there's no urgency to accept a low offer.  
* Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round and see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. 
* $11,000 is still above my minimum value and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* This move signals that I'm serious about selling to Bob but also that I won't settle for a significantly low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While getting closer to my minimum value, $9,500 is still below my desired profit margin.
* I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, so accepting a lower offer would be a loss. 
* By rejecting, I can make another counteroffer and continue to gauge Bob's willingness to pay closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This offer is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value.
* It shows I'm willing to meet him halfway, but still have room to negotiate if needed.
* At this point, I'm starting to consider the potential for Bob to walk away.  If he rejects, I'll need to weigh selling to John against continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  
* It's getting increasingly likely that Bob won't be willing to meet my price. 
* Since I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Bob. 
* Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit and avoids further potential losses."
