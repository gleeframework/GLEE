"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
