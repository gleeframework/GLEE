"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold strategy, but it gives me a strong starting point and allows for potential negotiation down the line.  It's important to remember that I have a backup option in John, who will pay $800,000, so I'm not taking an unreasonable risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer**. While $800,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round, but I'll keep in mind that John is a solid backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for potential further negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about selling the product to Bob, but I'm not willing to settle for his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer**.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm still holding out for a better price. John offers a guaranteed $800,000, and Bob's offer is lower. I'm going to try to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer. I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to settle for less than $800,000 yet. I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to **Sell to John**. Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to risk going lower.  John offers a guaranteed $800,000, which is my floor price, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal with Bob."
