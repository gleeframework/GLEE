Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I can offer it to you for $125. It's a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from this product.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $125, and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer. Buying from John for $120 guarantees the best price."
