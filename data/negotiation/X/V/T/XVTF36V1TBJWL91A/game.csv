"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1300000.  This price still leaves you with a good margin for profit, and allows me to move forward with the sale.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
