Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts.  
    * Bob saves $50,000 from his perceived value.
    * You earn $150,000 more than selling to John. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly."
