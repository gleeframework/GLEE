"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value of $100, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's initial interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $120. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $135. This is a compromise, closer to his offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept the deal, but I'm also leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $125. While it's getting closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a better price.  I'm confident that I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $130.  This is a slight increase from his last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but also demonstrating that I believe the product is worth more.  I'm hoping this will be enough to persuade Bob to accept the deal, but I'm still prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $115.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it.  There are still a few rounds left, so I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob.  I'm hoping to get a higher price, but I'll consider selling to John if I can't get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $125. This is a compromise, closer to his offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept the deal, as we're getting close to the end of the rounds."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the last few rounds.  Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum, and it's not worth risking another round or two to get a better offer from him. John is willing to buy the product for my minimum price, so I'm going to sell to John."
