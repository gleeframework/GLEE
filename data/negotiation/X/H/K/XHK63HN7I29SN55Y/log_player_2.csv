"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can try to get a better price from Alice since her offer is higher than our $100 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer. This gives us room to negotiate upward while still staying below our $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is closer to our target, we still have room to negotiate. Alice is willing to move from her initial offer, suggesting we might be able to get a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $95 is probably too low.  Would you be willing to meet at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

We're proposing a price that's the maximum we are willing to pay. This makes it clear to Alice what our limit is while still leaving the negotiation open."
