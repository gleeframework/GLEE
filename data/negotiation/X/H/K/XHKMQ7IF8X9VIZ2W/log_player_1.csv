Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob's likely acceptance. 

* **For you:**  It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80, and still leaves a good profit margin. 
* **For Bob:** It's less than the full value he places on the product, allowing him a saving, and is likely to be more attractive than rejecting the offer and potentially losing out on the product entirely."
