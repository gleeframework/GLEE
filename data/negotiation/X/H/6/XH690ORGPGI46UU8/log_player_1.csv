Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for a profit and this price is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is lower than the product's worth to Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It shows you're serious:**  Offering a specific price demonstrates your commitment to selling and encourages a focused negotiation.

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's responses and your desire to reach a quick deal or maximize your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is a decent profit, it's still lower than the price I'd like to achieve.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm looking for something closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000.  Perhaps we can meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This price still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,050,000? I think this is a fair compromise that would allow us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,050,000 is still a significant profit and a good compromise.  It's important to consider the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer of $800,000. Accepting this offer secures a solid deal."
