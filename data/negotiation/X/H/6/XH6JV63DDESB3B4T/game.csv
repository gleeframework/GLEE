"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
