"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $9,000 is more than your maximum budget, and you have rounds left to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,500. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  We'll see if she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to accept it.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Alice $8,000. This is my maximum budget, so if she rejects this, I'll just buy from John."
