Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.

Alice is offering $12,500, which is still better than John's offer, but you can likely still negotiate a bit lower.  You are willing to go up to $15,000, and she's down to $12,500, so there's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still hoping to get it a bit lower. How about $11,500?  That's a good price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower, Bob. I think $12,500 is a fair price for the product, considering its value to you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $12,750? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's final offer of $12,750 is still a good deal for you. You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and this price is significantly less than that. It's time to accept and finalize the purchase."
