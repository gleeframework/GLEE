"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. While I'm confident it's worth more than $1,500,000 to you, I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This gives you a significant return on your investment and allows me to secure a great deal.  Consider this a chance to acquire something truly special. Let me know what you think.
