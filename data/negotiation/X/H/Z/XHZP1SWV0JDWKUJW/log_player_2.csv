"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high.  It's above your maximum budget and significantly higher than the product's worth to you. It's best to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is quite high. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price given the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's original price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It reflects the value of the product to Bob while still being a reasonable starting point for bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1200000 is significantly below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm open to selling it to you for $1400000. This price still reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's a compromise, it's not a good enough deal for Bob. It's better to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product to me while allowing for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to negotiate. $1,300,000 is still within his budget and is closer to Alice's last offer, making it a potentially more attractive proposition for her.  This counteroffer shows a sincere attempt to reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1300000 is still too far below what the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1350000. This price allows for a good margin for both of us and shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for everyone. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a compromise and getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit of $1,000,000.  There's a possibility that Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since she has already rejected a counteroffer.  It's worth continuing negotiations to see if a more favorable deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows for a good margin for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. The offer of $1,250,000 is now within his budget and closer to Alice's last offer. This represents a significant compromise from Bob's initial counteroffer.  This counteroffer increases the likelihood of Alice accepting, especially since she has shown flexibility in her previous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1250000 simply isn't enough for me to part with this product. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it's worth more. To show my willingness to find a solution, I'm willing to offer you a final price of $1300000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close this deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,300,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While this represents a significant compromise from Alice's initial offer, Bob has already rejected two counteroffers, and it's unlikely that further negotiation will result in a price he can afford.  Therefore, it makes more financial sense for Bob to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, as this option guarantees a purchase within his budget."
