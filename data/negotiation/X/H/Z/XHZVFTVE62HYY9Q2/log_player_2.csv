"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's asking price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer, aiming to find a compromise. $9,000 is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but still higher than Bob's maximum.  This should prompt Alice to consider the possibility of a deal while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum of $8,000.  He can still potentially get a better deal by making another counteroffer. Since Bob can get the product from John for $8,000, he is not desperate and can afford to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to show he is willing to negotiate, but he is also staying within his budget.  This is a good middle ground that might be more appealing to Alice than his previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, but it's still above Bob's maximum of $8,000.  While continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, it's not guaranteed. Bob can secure the product for his maximum price from John, making this the most financially sound decision."
