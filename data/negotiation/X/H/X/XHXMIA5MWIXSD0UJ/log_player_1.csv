Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and given its value to you, I'm proposing a price of $12,000."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in your product's value.
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $15,000. Offering it at $12,000 presents a significant saving for him while still securing a substantial profit for you. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning that you believe the product is ""worth a significant amount to the right buyer,"" you subtly imply its value without explicitly stating your minimum price. 
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** While you have John as a backup,  it's best to secure the highest possible price from Bob first. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
