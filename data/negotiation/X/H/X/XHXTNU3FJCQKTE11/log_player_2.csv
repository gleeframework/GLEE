Alice's starting price is too high. We should counteroffer with a much lower price, closer to our own valuation.  While there's a risk Alice won't budge much, we always have John as a backup."

Alice's offer:

Alice came down considerably, which is good, but we're still above our absolute limit.  We need to inch closer to that $8,000 mark. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."

Alice has matched our absolute limit. There's no point in going further, as we can't get a better deal from John."
