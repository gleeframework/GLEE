"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it, but I'm not sure I can go any higher."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I still need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. How about we meet at $920,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is still too high for Bob. While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to continue trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $920,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $880,000. This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable purchasing from John if we can't reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 880000}
