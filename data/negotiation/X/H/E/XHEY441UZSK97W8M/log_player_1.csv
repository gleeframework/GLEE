"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $21,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 21000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $21,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to find a solution that works for both of us, selling at $12,000 is not an option. I'd rather explore selling to John at this point.
