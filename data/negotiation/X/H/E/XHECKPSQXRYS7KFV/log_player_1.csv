Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I start with a price higher than my minimum ($100) but lower than Bob's perceived value ($150). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a good profit.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even if vague, can make Bob more receptive.
* **Leaving the Ball in Bob's Court:** By letting Bob respond, I gain information about his willingness to pay. This will guide my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is still a $20 profit above my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate for a bit more, there's a risk that:

* **Bob might walk away:**  He could be turned off by further haggling.
* **Time is money:**  Negotiation takes time, and I have a guaranteed offer from John.

Accepting $120 now secures a decent profit and avoids potential losses."
