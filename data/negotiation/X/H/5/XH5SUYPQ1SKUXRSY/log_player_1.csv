{""product_price"": 130}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal.  Since I have John as a backup buyer for $120, I'm willing to negotiate down a bit if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my value. I'm confident Bob will be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing him completely by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
