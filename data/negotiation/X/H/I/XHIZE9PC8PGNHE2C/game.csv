"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $100 is a little high for me.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $95?  That would be a good deal for both of us, and it's still less than what the product is worth to you.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to be.  How about $92?  That's a good price for both of us and keeps the deal moving.",92.0,Bob,4,
