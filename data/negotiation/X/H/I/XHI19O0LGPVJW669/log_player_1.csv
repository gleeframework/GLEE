"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the potential in your product, your initial price is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is a fair price given my assessment of its value. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, $800,000 is far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price.

Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a fair compromise given our respective valuations. Let's work together to find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a slight increase, $850,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer, or even secure the full $1,000,000 from John if necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still significantly below the value I see in this product. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This price reflects the product's potential, and it's a reasonable midpoint between our initial valuations.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a fair compromise and closer to my budget. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still a bit too low. I'm confident I can get closer to my target with a counteroffer, and if necessary, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $925,000, which is a fair compromise given our previous offers.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still trying to stretch my budget as far as I can.  I'm willing to offer $910,000, which is a fair compromise and close to my final offer.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. Bob's offer of $910,000 is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value, and we're running out of rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my target price, and I'd rather not risk losing out on that by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
