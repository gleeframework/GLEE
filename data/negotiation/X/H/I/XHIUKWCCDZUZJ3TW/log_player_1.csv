Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $110 is a bit too low for me to go, but I'm willing to make one last concession. How about $125 and we have a deal?"", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still over my budget. I'm willing to go up to $100. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, he's still significantly below my minimum. It's unlikely he'll go much higher and I risk getting stuck with a low price.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $150 from John."
