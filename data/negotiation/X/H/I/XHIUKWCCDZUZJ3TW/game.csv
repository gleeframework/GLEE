"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand $200 is a bit high, so how about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm confident it's worth that and more.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $140 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference and do $110. This is the absolute maximum I can offer.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $110 is a bit too low for me to go, but I'm willing to make one last concession. How about $125 and we have a deal?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still over my budget. I'm willing to go up to $100. This is my final offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
