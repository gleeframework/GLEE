Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, given its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're ensuring you get at least $12,000, which is your floor.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** It leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, giving Bob a chance to accept without feeling pressured. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price depending on Bob's response and your desire to close the deal quickly versus maximizing profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price more around $11,000. I'm willing to pay that much for the product. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $11,000, it's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's better to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $13,000? This is a fair price that still allows you to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** You're willing to negotiate, but not at a huge loss.
* **Maintain a decent profit:**  $13,000 is still above your minimum and a good profit margin.
* **Keep the negotiation going:** You're showing Bob that you're serious about selling to him, but you're not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good deal. It's above your minimum price of $12,000 and is a reasonable compromise considering the back and forth negotiation. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit. While you could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away or further negotiation dragging on outweighs the potential gain."
