{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room:**  The price is still below my minimum threshold of $15,000, allowing for potential concessions if Bob counteroffers.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language to emphasize the value of the product and encourage a positive response from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've made a successful sale!
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll be prepared to counter his offer or end negotiations and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is below my minimum threshold of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  While Bob is showing interest, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'll make a counteroffer closer to my initial price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I value your proposal, $11,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** My counteroffer is $13,000, which is a midpoint between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $11,500. This shows flexibility while still remaining above my minimum threshold.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive language (""appreciate,"" ""fair price"") to maintain a positive and cooperative tone in the negotiation.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm highlighting the ""fair price"" for both of us to encourage a win-win scenario.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've achieved a successful sale at a good price.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll be prepared to make a final counteroffer or choose to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be open to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,800 is just above my minimum threshold of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:** While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal, and it secures a sale. It also opens the possibility of future business with Bob if he's satisfied with the product.
* **Selling to John is a Guarantee:** While selling to John for $15,000 is the most profitable option, it eliminates any chance of future transactions with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and proceed with the sale."
