"Hi Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob! I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to offer the product for $85, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",85.0,Alice,5,
