"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. I believe it's a fair price considering its exceptional quality and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The price is way too high for Bob. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,400,000 is far too high for me. Considering my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer you $800,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $800000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique features and its potential value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a serious compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the product's value and my budget, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal.  I'm confident we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not convinced that $900000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a good balance between your budget and the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, but she's still above it.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's more likely he'll be able to find a better deal with John."
