"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. I believe it's a fair price considering its exceptional quality and rarity.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1400000 is far too high for me. Considering my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer you $800000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $800000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique features and its potential value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a serious compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the product's value and my budget, I'm willing to offer $900000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal.  I'm confident we can find common ground at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not convinced that $900000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a good balance between your budget and the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,5,
