Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I'm selling and I think you might be interested. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Asking for his opinion:** By asking for his thoughts, I'm opening the door for him to make a counteroffer, which is the goal of this negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his response. If he rejects the offer, I'll need to analyze if his counteroffer is worth considering or if I should move on to John for a guaranteed $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:** While I'm happy to sell for $100, I'm not desperate. This gives me room to try and get a better price.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still a chance Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if I counter with a slightly lower offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is still higher than $100, but lower than my original offer.  This will show him I'm willing to negotiate, while also trying to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is my absolute minimum, I'd be willing to come down a little to $120.  This is still a great deal for you, and it lets me make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's midway between my original offer and Bob's counteroffer, signaling my willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing that even at $120, the product is a good deal for Bob.
* **Maintaining profit margin:**  $120 is still above my minimum, allowing me to earn a decent profit. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll assess Bob's response carefully.  If he rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to accept his original $100 offer or move on to John for the guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum of $100.  
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take a lot of time and might not result in a significantly higher price. 
* **Guarantee a sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale, avoiding the risk of further rejection or having to sell to John for a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the sale with Bob at $110 and move on to other opportunities."
