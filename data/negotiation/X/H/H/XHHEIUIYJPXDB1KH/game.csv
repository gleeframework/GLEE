"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer you $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering the value you mentioned. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe the product's value is worth every penny, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your increased offer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is enough to meet the product's value. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I need to feel confident that we're at a price that reflects the product's worth. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I understand you believe in the value of your product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a significant jump from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that recognizes the value of your product. Let's close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to feel confident that we're at a price that reflects its true worth. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000.
