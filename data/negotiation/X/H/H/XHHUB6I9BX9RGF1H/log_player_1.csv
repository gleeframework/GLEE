Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $15,000 meets my minimum threshold. It's better to secure the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation or potentially selling to John for the same price."
