"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a point where I might need to consider other options. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to a fair price. I'm thinking of $11500. This is a bit higher than my previous offer, but I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
