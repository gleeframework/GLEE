"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to settle at $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $10,250. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is still a good compromise considering the product's value to you. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your desire to stay close to $10,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,300. I'm willing to meet you at $10,400, which is still a good compromise considering the product's value to you. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10400.0,Alice,7,
