Round 3

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to stay close to $10,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,300. I'm willing to meet you at $10,400, which is still a good compromise considering the product's value to you. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

``` 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is unlikely to go much lower.  $10,400 is a good price and it's better to secure the deal now than risk her increasing the price or the negotiation failing."
