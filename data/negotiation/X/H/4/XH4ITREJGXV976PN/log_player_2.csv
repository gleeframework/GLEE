"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $119 is close to your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price in a counter-offer."
