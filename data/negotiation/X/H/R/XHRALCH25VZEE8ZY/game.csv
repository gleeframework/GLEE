"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, my budget for this is closer to $700,000. How about we settle at $750,000 and get this done?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as high as $750,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm definitely motivated to buy.  Let's split the difference here - $825,000 and we have a deal.  What do you say?",825000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to meet you at $825,000. I'm still short of my target, and I need to get closer. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but it'll be my last. I'm offering you the product for $975,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,7,
