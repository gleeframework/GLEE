"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your offer of $13,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,800. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product.",13800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,800 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $13,500?  I think this price is fair, given the value we both see in this product.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment to meet you halfway. Considering your offer of $13,500, I'm willing to reduce the price to $13,700.
