Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It makes more sense to counter-offer at this point."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still better off selling to John at this point. I'll make one more counteroffer that's closer to my minimum to test the waters, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John."
