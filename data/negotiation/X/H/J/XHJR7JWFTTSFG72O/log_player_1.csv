"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the unique benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and creates the impression that the product is highly valuable.
* **Justification:**  I'm not just throwing out a number; I'm framing it as a fair starting point and highlighting the ""unique benefits."" This encourages Bob to engage in a discussion about value rather than immediately rejecting the offer.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer. This gives me leverage and allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $650,000. I believe this is a more reasonable starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own perceived value.  While I want to negotiate, accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. I need to steer the negotiation back towards a more reasonable range. I'm confident that I can get a better price, especially with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This reflects a substantial decrease on my part, and I believe it represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Hold Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and willingness to negotiate but stand firm that his initial price is too low. 
* **Significant Reduction, but Above Minimum:**  I'm making a substantial reduction from my initial price to show movement and encourage Bob to do the same. However, I'm keeping the price well above my $1,000,000 minimum and closer to my original offer to aim for a higher final price.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** By framing this as a compromise, I'm emphasizing that I'm willing to negotiate but also expecting Bob to move significantly from his position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think your offer is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the negotiation so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is getting interesting! Bob is now getting closer to my minimum price, but I still have room to negotiate. His ""meet you halfway"" strategy seems to be working in his favor, so I need to counter it strategically. I'll continue negotiating to try and secure a price closer to $1 million."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're making progress. While $900,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the full value of this product. Let's settle this fairly: I propose $1,025,000. This is a significant move on my end, and I believe it's a mutually beneficial offer."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** I start by acknowledging the progress and Bob's effort. This helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Moving Closer, But Above Minimum:**  My counteroffer is a small decrease from my previous price, but critically, it stays above my $1,000,000 minimum.
* **""Fair and Mutually Beneficial"":**  By emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit, I'm appealing to Bob's sense of getting a good deal while also subtly reiterating the value of the product. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  As we progress through the rounds, I want to apply a subtle sense of urgency to encourage Bob to reach a decision soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another move, but I need to be closer to my target. I propose a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the negotiation so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to move significantly past $850,000. He is consistently aiming for the midpoint in negotiations, and I've already moved considerably from my initial offer. Continuing this negotiation risks a smaller profit margin, and I'm better off taking the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed deal."
