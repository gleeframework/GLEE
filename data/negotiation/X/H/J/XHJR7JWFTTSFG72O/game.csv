"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the unique benefits it offers.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $650,000. I believe this is a more reasonable starting point for further negotiation.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This reflects a substantial decrease on my part, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think your offer is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the negotiation so far.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're making progress. While $900,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the full value of this product. Let's settle this fairly: I propose $1,025,000. This is a significant move on my end, and I believe it's a mutually beneficial offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another move, but I need to be closer to my target. I propose a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the negotiation so far.",850000.0,Bob,6,
