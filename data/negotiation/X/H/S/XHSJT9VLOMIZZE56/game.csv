,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. How about $75? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $85.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $82.50?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",82.5,Bob,4,
