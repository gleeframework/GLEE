,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I've done some research and I've found a similar product being sold elsewhere for around this price, and I'm willing to make a fair offer.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, this product holds significant value for me, and $12,000 falls short of that. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we settle on $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,000. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I think this is a fair offer considering the market value I've researched.",13500.0,Bob,4,
