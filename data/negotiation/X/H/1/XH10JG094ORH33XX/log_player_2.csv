"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you acknowledging the value to me.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's a better price than buying from John and significantly less than the initial offer from Alice. Accepting this offer saves Bob money and secures the product."
