Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing a bit aggressively:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it would be a valuable asset for you. I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its true worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  We start with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) than your minimum ($10,000). This aims to maximize potential profit.
* **Slight Negotiation Room:** The $500 difference between the offer and Bob's value leaves a small window for him to potentially counter-offer, making him feel like he got a slightly better deal. 
* **Confident Language:** The message uses positive and confident language, emphasizing the product's value to Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk:** This approach has some risk. Bob might reject the offer outright, leading you to John's guaranteed $10,000.
* **Alternatives:** 
    * You could offer a lower price for a faster, more certain sale. 
    * You could try to gather more information about Bob's willingness to pay before making an offer.
