"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, I'm currently only able to offer $1,200,000. This reflects my budget and the value I see in the product at this stage. I'm open to further discussions to find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 falls short of what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I see you're serious about this purchase. To avoid prolonging this, I'll come down slightly.  Let's settle this at $1,275,000. This is my final offer, Bob.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,275,000 is getting closer, but I'm still just a bit over my budget.  To finalize this deal, I'm prepared to offer $1,260,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product and allows us to reach an agreement.",1260000.0,Bob,6,
