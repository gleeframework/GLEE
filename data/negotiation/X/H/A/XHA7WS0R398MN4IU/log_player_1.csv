Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob a reason to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and compromise.
* **It's accompanied by a friendly message:** This encourages a positive and collaborative negotiation. 

I've chosen to start with a significant discount to make the offer attractive to Bob. This is because, based on the information given, I'm more likely to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  While I'm hoping to find a compromise, selling to John for $15,000 is still the best option if the negotiation doesn't lead to a price I'm happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $9,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to go down to $11,000 to meet halfway. This still allows me to get a fair price, and hopefully, it's a price you can live with."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $11,000. I'm thinking more in the range of $9,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum. I don't want to risk further rounds of negotiation that might not yield a better outcome.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me the best possible price."
