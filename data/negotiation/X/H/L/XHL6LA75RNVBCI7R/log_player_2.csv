You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82 and $75, which is $78.50. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $78.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $78.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting the $78.50 offer gets us the product for a price well below John's $100 and closer to Alice's perceived value.  Continuing to negotiate risks annoying Alice or missing out on a reasonable deal."
