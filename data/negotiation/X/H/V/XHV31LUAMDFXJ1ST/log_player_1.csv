Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting higher gives you a cushion.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A starting price of $20,000 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Highlighting value:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could adjust the initial offer."
