"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 was a bit steep for you. However, I'm still a bit above the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. Is that something you'd be interested in?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a little high though.  How about $12,500?  That's a fair compromise for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I think we're getting close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I can do $13,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is that a deal for you?",13000.0,Alice,5,
