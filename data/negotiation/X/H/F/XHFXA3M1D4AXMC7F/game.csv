"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I can only stretch to $950000. I'd like to make a counteroffer at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1050000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1050000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",920000.0,Bob,6,
