"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10500 is still a bit high for me. How about we try $9800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, but $9800 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. How about we compromise at $10200? I'm willing to give you a bit more wiggle room, but I need to make sure I get a good deal on this product.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concessions, but $9800 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying from someone else.",9500.0,Bob,10,
