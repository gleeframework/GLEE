"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it's worth $175. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) and higher than Bob's perceived value ($100). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while keeping Bob interested. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't give in easily. I have a fallback option with John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to sell for such a low amount, especially since I have John as a backup buyer who's willing to pay my minimum.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to get closer to my desired price. I'll use the next round to counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I can come down to $160, but that's my lowest price.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $175 to $160. 
* **Firm but fair:** I'm stating that $160 is my lowest price to show that I'm serious about getting a fair deal.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both of us.  I'm confident that $160 is a reasonable price considering the value of the product to me and to Bob. I'll keep pushing for a better deal while still keeping my backup option in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for considering my request, Alice. I'd like to propose $140 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $140 is still below the $150 threshold.  Since I have John as a backup buyer willing to pay my minimum, I'm not willing to sell at a loss.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and try to reach a price closer to my desired $150.  The next round will be crucial to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $145. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Split the difference:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($160) and Bob's offer ($140). This shows a willingness to compromise and meet in the middle.
* **Highlight fairness:** I'm framing $145 as a fair price for both of us, emphasizing that it's a win-win situation. 
* **Confidence in the product:** I'm reminding Bob that he'll be happy with the product, hoping to increase his desire to buy.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a price that's close to my minimum while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. By splitting the difference, I'm hoping to create a sense of urgency for Bob to accept the deal. If he rejects this offer, I'm more likely to sell to John in the next round."
