"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. How about $1,000,000? It's a significant value for you, and it's a reasonable price for me. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $950,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
