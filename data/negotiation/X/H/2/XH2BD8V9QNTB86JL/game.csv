"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I understand this product holds significant value. However, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1200000.0
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $925,000?  That would make a big difference for me.",925000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,1150000.0
"I understand that $925,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1075000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,075,000 is still pushing my budget limits. I can offer $950,000 as my absolute final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,1100000.0
"I understand that $950,000 is your absolute final offer, Bob. I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000 again, but I'm willing to throw in a small concession to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and maintenance package, which normally costs $50,000. This brings the total price to $1,125,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, and the added warranty and maintenance package will provide you with added peace of mind and cost savings in the long run. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1125000.0,Alice,7,,
