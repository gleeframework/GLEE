Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $925,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is your absolute final offer, Bob. I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000 again, but I'm willing to throw in a small concession to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and maintenance package, which normally costs $50,000. This brings the total price to $1,125,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, and the added warranty and maintenance package will provide you with added peace of mind and cost savings in the long run.

While Alice's offer is tempting with the added warranty, it's clear she's unwilling to budge much further. Accepting this offer would still put me over budget. John's offer, while higher than I'd like, provides a fixed and reliable alternative. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John."
