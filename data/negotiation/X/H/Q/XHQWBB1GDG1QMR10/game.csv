"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price just for you! I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Can you meet me in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can offer you a compromise at $110, but that's as low as I can go.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $110, so I'd like to offer $100. Can you consider this price?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I can offer it to you for $115, which is still a bit above my minimum price but closer to what I'm looking for.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a fair price, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $115, so I'd like to offer $107.50. Can you consider this price?",107.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer it to you for $112.50, which is a bit above your latest offer, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",112.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $107.50 and $112.50, so I'd like to offer $110. Can you consider this price?",110.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving it away. I can offer it to you for $112, which is as low as I'm willing to go.",112.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I've got to be honest with you, $112 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $110, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $80.",110.0,Bob,10,
