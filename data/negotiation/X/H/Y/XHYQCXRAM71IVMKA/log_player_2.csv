{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  This gives Alice an incentive to negotiate, while still giving you a good chance to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than your previous offer and still within the range you're willing to pay. It's worth continuing negotiations to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows you are willing to meet halfway, potentially encouraging Alice to accept and finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffers are getting increasingly higher, nearing the price John is offering.  It seems unlikely you'll be able to get a price lower than $950,000 from Alice,  and John's offer is only $50,000 more. It's not worth risking further negotiation to potentially save a small amount, especially considering the time and energy it would take.  Buying from John is the most efficient way to get the product."
