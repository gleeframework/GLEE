Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification for Price:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, it emphasizes its ""immense value and potential."" This subtly justifies the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high initial offer allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. Even if you need to come down slightly, you're still likely to get a better price than John's offer.

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims to maximize your profit.  However, it's essential to consider Bob's personality and your existing relationship with him. If you believe a less aggressive approach might be more effective, you can adjust the starting price accordingly."
