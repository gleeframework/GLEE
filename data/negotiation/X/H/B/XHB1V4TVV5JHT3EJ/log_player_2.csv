"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below her valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you can move to purchase from John and secure the best possible price."
