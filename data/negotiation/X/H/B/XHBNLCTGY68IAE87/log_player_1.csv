``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum asking price of $100. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  However, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my minimum asking price. Would you consider $95? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. While I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price, I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than my minimum.  It's better to take the guaranteed $100 than to keep negotiating and potentially end up with less."
