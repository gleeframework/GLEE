Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum of $10,000.  I'm curious to see how much he's willing to pay."

I have 4 rounds left and I'm not ready to settle for anything less than $13,500.
