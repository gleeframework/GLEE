"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my target price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. This gives Bob a clear understanding of my expectations and leaves room for potential compromise if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I need to try to negotiate a better price. While I could sell to John immediately for my desired price, there's still potential to get closer to my goal by engaging in further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. However, it still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable value and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue to negotiate, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  However, if the next few rounds don't yield a more favorable offer, I might need to consider selling to John to avoid losing too much time and potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway.  I'm still a bit away from my target price, but I'm getting closer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can still get a better price. It's worth continuing the negotiation with a few more rounds to see if I can reach a more favorable agreement. However, I'm getting closer to considering selling to John, as the time is ticking away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,125,000.  This is a smaller concession than my last offer, but I'm hoping that Bob is getting close to his limit. This is a risky move, as we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. But I'm hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough call.  Bob's offer is still below my desired price, but it's getting very close.  We're running out of time, and if I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might walk away altogether. Additionally, if I sell to John, I'll get my desired price, but I'll miss out on the potential to build a relationship with Bob.  Considering all of this, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal scenario, it's a good deal, and it ensures I'm not losing out completely."
