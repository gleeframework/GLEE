"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating further.  $1,100,000 is still a significant amount of money above Alice's minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good price. It's within your budget and still leaves some room for profit for Alice. It's also a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer is the most financially beneficial decision."
