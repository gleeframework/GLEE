"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
