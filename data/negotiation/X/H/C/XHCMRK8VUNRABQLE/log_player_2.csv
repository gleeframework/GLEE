```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in [Product Description].  While $1250000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still slightly above my minimum.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $1,400,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference and go with $1,300,000.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value of [Product Description] and my budget constraints.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my strategy of making small, incremental increases in my offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground between Alice's last offer and my maximum budget. Hopefully, this will be seen as a fair compromise, and we can finally reach an agreement."
