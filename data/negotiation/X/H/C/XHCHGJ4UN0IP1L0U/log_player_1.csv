Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,150,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $1,150,000 is lower than what Bob values the product at ($1,200,000), giving him incentive to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can always counter-offer slightly lower to try and reach an agreement.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while also increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
