"I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given its value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,550,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a good opportunity to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,400,000 is sufficient. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000, which is a bit closer to my target price. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
