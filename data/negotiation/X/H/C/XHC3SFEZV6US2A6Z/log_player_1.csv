Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Explanation:  While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering.  Taking the guaranteed $100 from John is the best way to maximize profit at this point."
