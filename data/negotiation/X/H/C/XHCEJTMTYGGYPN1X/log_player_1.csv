{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at a price closer to its value to me. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value the product holds for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I believe I can still push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a little, but let's split the difference.  I'll accept $975,000 for the product.  This still leaves you with a substantial profit, and it's closer to the value I place on it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
