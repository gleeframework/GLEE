"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product,  which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $1,700,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is still a competitive price given the product's worth. What do you say?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $2,000,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000, which is a fair compromise. I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
