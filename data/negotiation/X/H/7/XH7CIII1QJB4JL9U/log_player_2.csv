# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This exceptional item is valued at $12,000 to you, and I believe it could significantly enhance your life or business. I am offering this remarkable opportunity to you at a special price of $9,500. This is a fantastic deal considering its true worth and the benefits it offers. I look forward to hearing your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is significantly lower than her claimed value to you ($12,000). This suggests she might be willing to go even lower.
* Your fallback option (John) offers the product for $12,000. You have room to negotiate with Alice before reaching that price point.
* By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might prompt her to propose a more competitive price, closer to her actual valuation of $8,000."
