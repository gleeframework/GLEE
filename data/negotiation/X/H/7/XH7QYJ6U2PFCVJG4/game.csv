"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product to me. However, I'm only comfortable paying $950,000 at this time.  I understand this is a significant reduction from your initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.
