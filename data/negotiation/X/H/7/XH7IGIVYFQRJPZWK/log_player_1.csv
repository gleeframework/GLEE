Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum threshold of $100.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still thinking $95 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob in the hopes of getting closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100 for the product? It's a fair price for both of us and lets us finalize the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $97.50. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've reached a point where I'm concerned about the time remaining.  I'm going to sell to John for $100 to guarantee a sale that meets my minimum requirements."
