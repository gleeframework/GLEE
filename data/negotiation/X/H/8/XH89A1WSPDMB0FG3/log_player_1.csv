Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value and other potential buyers, you create a sense of urgency and desirability.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, the tone suggests openness to discussion, prompting Bob to engage. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, Alice is secure knowing John will purchase the product for her minimum acceptable price."
