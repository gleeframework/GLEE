"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that's sure to be mutually beneficial.  I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you, given its potential value.  My asking price is $1,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than John's price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of $800,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the initial offer, Bob might prompt Alice to propose a lower price, getting him a better deal."
