"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a discounted price of $100. This is a great deal for both of us, as I can still make a profit and you can get the product for a price that's less than its worth to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
