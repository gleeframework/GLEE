"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* It's only one round in, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob.
* Selling to John for $100 would be less profitable."
