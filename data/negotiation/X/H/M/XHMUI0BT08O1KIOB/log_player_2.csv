Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $120, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

```explanation: Alice has met your maximum price. There's no point in rejecting and potentially missing out on the deal, especially since John is offering the same price. Accepting now guarantees you get the product at your target price.  ```"
