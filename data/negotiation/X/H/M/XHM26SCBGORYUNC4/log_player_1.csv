{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you're interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly approach, establishes a connection to Bob's interest, and provides a starting price that is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this is a good starting point to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I'm not comfortable selling for that price right now. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $11,125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $11,125 is a good compromise. It's closer to my initial asking price and still significantly higher than my minimum.  It's also likely that Bob won't budge much further, and I could potentially end up selling to John for less if I continue negotiating."
