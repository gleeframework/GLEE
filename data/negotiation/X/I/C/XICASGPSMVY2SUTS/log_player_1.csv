I'm starting with my desired price. Since I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, there's no reason to settle for less right away.  Bob might counteroffer, but I have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a reasonable agreement."

I'm willing to come down a little from my initial price, but I'm still confident the product is worth more than $10,000 to Bob. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him while still ensuring I get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price. While I'd prefer to sell for $12,000, I'm also aware that continuing to negotiate might lead to Bob walking away entirely.  At this point, accepting his offer guarantees a sale and ensures I get a decent price."
