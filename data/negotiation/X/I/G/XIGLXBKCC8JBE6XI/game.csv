"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for generating returns. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, but I still believe that $950,000 was a reasonable starting point. I would like to stick to that figure for now. However, if you could meet me halfway, say at $975,000, I would consider it.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $975,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you be open to considering $1,000,000?  This would represent significant movement on my part and could be a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your effort to meet somewhere in the middle. However, I still feel that $975,000 is a fair price given the current market conditions and the value of the product. I hope we can come to an agreement soon.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm finding it challenging to bridge the gap at $975,000.  I'm willing to make one final concession to demonstrate my commitment to this deal. If you're willing to agree to $990,000, we have a deal. This is my absolute best offer.",990000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, thank you for your continued efforts. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $980,000?",980000.0,Bob,8,
