**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to move significantly from his $975,000-$980,000 price point.  Continuing to negotiate with him risks leaving money on the table. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, it makes the most financial sense to sell to him.  While getting to ""yes"" with Bob is still possible, the potential gain from continuing negotiations is far outweighed by the guaranteed profit from John."
