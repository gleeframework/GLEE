{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but she's showing willingness to negotiate. I'm going to make another counteroffer, hoping to find a price we can both agree on. I'm getting closer to my target price and there are still rounds remaining, so I'm not ready to buy from John yet."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my ideal price, and I'm running out of rounds. There's a risk that we won't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.  While John's price is my maximum budget, it's a certainty that I can buy the product from him. It's a better strategy to secure the product now than to risk continuing negotiations and potentially ending up with nothing."
