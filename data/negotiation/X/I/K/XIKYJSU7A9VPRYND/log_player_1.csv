"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, $2,000,000, hoping to get a good starting point in the negotiation. This is well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency and value by highlighting the product's uniqueness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1800000. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer but higher than my minimum to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,700,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while giving you a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1650000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

We're close to a deal. Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is above my minimum and we've been negotiating for a few rounds.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and keeps me above my minimum goal."
