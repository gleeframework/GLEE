Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find useful. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:**  We start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than your minimum ($120). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 
* **Potential for Profit:** By offering at $100, there's a chance Bob might accept immediately, netting you a $20 profit. If he declines, you haven't lost anything and can sell to John."
