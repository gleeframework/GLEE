"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to demonstrate my commitment to a deal. This price still offers you a substantial saving while ensuring a fair return for me. Let's find a common ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm thinking $925,000 is a fair price for the product. It's a bit lower than your last offer, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
