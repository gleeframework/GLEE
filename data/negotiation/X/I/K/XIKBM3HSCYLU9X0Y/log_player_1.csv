"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price. If Bob rejects, we can then start a counteroffer process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is a decent price, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price that's fair to me."
