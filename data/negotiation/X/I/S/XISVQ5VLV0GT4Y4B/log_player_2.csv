Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but $1,175,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, she's still significantly above your alternative option of buying from John for $1,000,000. Her latest offer of $1,250,000 is her ""final offer,"" meaning further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap sufficiently.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the best guaranteed price."
