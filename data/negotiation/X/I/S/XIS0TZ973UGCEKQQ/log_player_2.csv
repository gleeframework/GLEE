"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. I know it's worth that much to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to convince Bob that the price is fair, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Since Bob can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
