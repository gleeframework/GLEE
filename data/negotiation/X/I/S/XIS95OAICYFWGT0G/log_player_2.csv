"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still a good value for you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for a lower price."
