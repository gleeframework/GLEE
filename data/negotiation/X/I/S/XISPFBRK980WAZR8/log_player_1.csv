Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is a strong offer that sits comfortably above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) while still being attractive compared to my alternative sale price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message doesn't completely shut down the possibility of Bob countering with a slightly lower offer, keeping a small window open for further discussion."
