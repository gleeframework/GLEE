"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $20,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm! However, $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider something closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit high for you, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $17,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $14,000? That's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I can do $16,500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $15,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from $17,000. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference again and settle on $15,500? It's a fair deal for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $15,500. I can do $16,000, and that's my final offer. If you're interested, we can shake on it. If not, I'm happy to move on to other opportunities.",16000.0,Alice,7,
