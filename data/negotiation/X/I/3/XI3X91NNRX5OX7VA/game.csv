"Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a truly unique product. While I can't reveal the exact nature of it just yet, I can assure you it's worth well over a million dollars to me.  I'm willing to part with it for the price of $1200000. This is a significant discount considering its true value.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However,  $900000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly. I'm offering you a final price of $1050000. This is a  substantial discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1050000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
