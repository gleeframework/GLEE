"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  I'm open to discussing further if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make another offer. How about $9,500? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I think this could be a good compromise. Let me know if you're open to it.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would be a great deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for a price well below its true value. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still looking for a higher price, but I'm getting close to my budget limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10250.0,Bob,6,
