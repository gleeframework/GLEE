"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's a good product, Alice, but $90 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $70? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $70 is still below my desired value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $85. This is a good price for both of us, considering the product's quality.  What do you say?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I can do $75, and I think that's a very fair offer. It's a great product, and I'm ready to buy it right now at that price.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm very close to accepting your offer, but $75 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. Would you be willing to go up to $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would help me get closer to my desired value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",80.0,Alice,7,
