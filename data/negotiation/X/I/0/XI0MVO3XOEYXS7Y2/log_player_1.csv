"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to me ($100) to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize profit. 
* **Showing Flexibility:**  I'm adding a message that indicates I'm open to negotiation, which could encourage Bob to counter-offer and engage further. 
* **No Immediate Dealbreaker:** $110 is likely to be rejected by Bob, but it's not an outright dealbreaker. It allows for the negotiation to progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100 and even below what the product is worth to him.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial counteroffer was far too low, it shows he's interested in the product.  There's room for negotiation to find a price closer to my desired value. 
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as an option provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails. However, I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's significantly closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Fair Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product, suggesting that $90 is a fair price.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive tone, inviting Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, but $90 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $70? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation is key:** I'm not giving up on a potentially better deal.  The fact that Bob is willing to keep negotiating indicates he might be willing to move higher.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Having John's offer provides a good backup if the negotiation with Bob falls apart. However, I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $70 is still below my desired value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $85. This is a good price for both of us, considering the product's quality.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's precisely midway between my previous offer ($90) and Bob's offer ($70). This shows a strong desire to find a middle ground.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's quality to justify the price and appeal to Bob's perceived value.
* **Positive and Engaging:** The message is positive and invites Bob to continue the negotiation. It's crucial to keep the dialogue open and maintain a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I can do $75, and I think that's a very fair offer. It's a great product, and I'm ready to buy it right now at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  The fact that Bob is ready to buy at $75 shows his increasing interest. It indicates he's willing to negotiate further.
* **John's offer provides a safety net:**  Having John's offer ensures I won't lose out on a sale if negotiation with Bob fails. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  Bob is getting closer to my desired value, and I might be able to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm very close to accepting your offer, but $75 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. Would you be willing to go up to $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would help me get closer to my desired value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Building on Progress:** I'm acknowledging Bob's increasing willingness to pay, showing that I'm receptive to his offers.
* **Small Increase:**  I'm proposing a small increase of $5, which is less than my previous jump. This signals a willingness to be flexible while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm highlighting that $80 is a fair price for both of us, emphasizing a win-win situation.
* **Openness:**  The message keeps the conversation open and invites Bob to further negotiate."
