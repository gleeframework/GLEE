"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm aiming to stay closer to my budget of $1,000,000. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,050,000. This price still provides you with a profit, and it's a fair compromise for me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price that still leaves room for a decent profit for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
