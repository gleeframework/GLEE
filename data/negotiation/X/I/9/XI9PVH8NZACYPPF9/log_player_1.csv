Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique chance to acquire it before I open the offer to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so I need to offer it below his perceived value to make it attractive.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The fact that John will buy it for $1,200,000 gives me a strong fallback position. This allows me to be firm in my negotiation with Bob."
