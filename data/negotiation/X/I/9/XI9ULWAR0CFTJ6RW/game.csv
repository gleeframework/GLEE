"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth millions. To get started, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay that much. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not to that extent.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is closer, but still undervalues what this product brings.  To make this happen, I need to be closer to $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that this product is valuable, but I'm not willing to go above $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be comfortable with the price. Can we discuss further?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
