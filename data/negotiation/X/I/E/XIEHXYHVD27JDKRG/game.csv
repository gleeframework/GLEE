,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, recognizing your interest in the product. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a fair opportunity.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While $1,600,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not willing to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  Let's make this happen.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
