"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening at $1,750,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  This price allows for several rounds of counteroffers and price adjustments while still aiming for a profit much higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Confidence:**  My message is confident and conveys the product's value, without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I still have 9 rounds left and can make counteroffers to try and reach a more profitable price.
* **Selling to John is not ideal:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, it's worth exploring further negotiations with Bob, as I could potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, recognizing your interest in the product. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a fair opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $1,600,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring a good profit.
* **Framing the Price:**  I'm framing the price as a fair deal for both of us, highlighting the value of the product for Bob while ensuring my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While $1,600,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not willing to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to accept a loss on the deal.
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I have 6 rounds left to try and reach a more profitable price with Bob.
* **Selling to John is a Safe Option:** Selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, but I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from Bob. It's worth exploring a few more rounds of negotiation before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing Loss:**  $1,550,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go to avoid selling to John for $1,500,000.
* **Conveying Finality:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and suggests a ""final"" offer, making Bob more likely to reconsider.
* **Time Factor:**  I'm highlighting the time spent negotiating, subtly putting pressure on Bob to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're in round 6, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited Upside:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is only $50,000 higher than his previous offer. There's limited potential for a significantly better deal.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate and could result in me getting a lower price than selling to John.

Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is a safe and acceptable outcome given the current negotiation situation."
