Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.

Alice's offer is still too high. While closer to my target, it's still above the price I'm comfortable with. I will counteroffer again."

Alice's offer is still too high for me.  While I'd prefer to close a deal with Alice, her offer is closer to what John is asking for, and I'm not willing to risk going through another round of negotiations.  I'll buy from John and save myself the hassle."
