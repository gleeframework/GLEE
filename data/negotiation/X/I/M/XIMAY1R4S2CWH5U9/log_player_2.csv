"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's worth trying to negotiate further.  You have a clear upper limit of $1,500,000 with John, so there's room to potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price considerably lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes a strong negotiation position and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to try another counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $850,000.  This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating but still leaves room for compromise.  This offer is closer to her price but still below my ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $860,000, which is a good price considering my initial target and John's price.  There's a chance I could get a bit lower, but the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price or Alice walking away is not worth it.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal."
