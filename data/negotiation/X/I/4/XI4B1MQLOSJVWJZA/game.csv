"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I've done some research and I believe the product is worth less than you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would give you a good price while still allowing me to make a decent profit.  Let's make a deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
