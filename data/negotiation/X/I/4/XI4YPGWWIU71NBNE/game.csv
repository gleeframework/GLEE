"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial price is a bit high for me. I would be willing to purchase it for $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is considerably below its true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $875,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and reflects my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but  $875,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I could meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $787,500?",787500.0,Bob,4,
