"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  While I understand your perspective, I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it reflects a fair compromise. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
