Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.  Even though $120 is better than selling to John, I think I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $120 isn't quite enough for me right now. How about $130? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've been considering the product and am willing to offer $125. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $125 is still a decent profit and better than selling to John. It's also getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds, so it's better to secure the deal now."
