Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a decent price for me. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This price is a compromise. It's significantly lower than my minimum desired price ($15,000) but still higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000). 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the deal for Bob while still highlighting the value for me. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my chances of getting a sale while still securing a decent price. 

* **Bob's perspective:** A $10,000 price is a good deal for him, as he values the product at $8,000. 
* **My perspective:** This price is better than selling to John for $15,000, but it still covers most of my minimum desired price. 

By offering a compromise price, I increase the probability of Bob accepting the offer, while still securing a higher price than I would get by selling to John."
