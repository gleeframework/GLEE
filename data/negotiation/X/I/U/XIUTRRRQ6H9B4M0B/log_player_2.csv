"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds left, so there's time to work towards a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower offer:**  A $9,000 counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's $12,000 offer.  This shows Bob is serious about negotiation.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $9,000 is still above Alice's $8,000 value, so it's a potential compromise.
* **Positive tone:** The message is polite and open to negotiation. It doesn't make Alice feel like Bob is trying to take advantage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price still allows me to make a fair profit while giving you a great deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer, but $11,000 is still too high for Bob.  He has 7 rounds left to negotiate and wants to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue bargaining and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob is making another significant move, showing his willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Fair price:** $10,000 is still more than Alice's $8,000 value, so it's a reasonable proposition. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is polite and emphasizes finding a mutually acceptable solution."
