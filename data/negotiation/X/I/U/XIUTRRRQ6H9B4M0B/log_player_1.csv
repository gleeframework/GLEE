"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that it's worth $15,000 to him. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I use language like ""What do you think?"" to signal that I'm open to negotiation and willing to listen to his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $9,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Moving to the Next Round:**  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price still allows me to make a fair profit while giving you a great deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a counteroffer of $11,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** I emphasize that this price represents a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Focusing on Mutual Benefit:** I reiterate that the price is fair for both of us, highlighting the potential for a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:** While $10,000 is slightly below my ideal price, it's still a decent profit for me.  Considering that we're already four rounds into the negotiation, accepting this offer is a good strategy to avoid potential further losses in future rounds.  I'm confident I won't get a significantly higher price from Bob.

* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing the negotiation could lead to a stalemate, forcing me to sell to John for a lower price. Accepting Bob's offer secures a profitable sale."
