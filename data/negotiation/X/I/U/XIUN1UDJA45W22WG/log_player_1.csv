Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential negotiation and a quicker sale. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" encourages Bob to act quickly and consider the offer seriously.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,100,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), giving us room for negotiation.
    *  Still a substantial profit for us, even if Bob negotiates a slight discount. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
