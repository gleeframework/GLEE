"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about $950,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider that?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  However, $920,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $935,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward.",935000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $935,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $915,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",915000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm running out of room to negotiate.  $915,000 is still too low for me.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to go down to $925,000. This is my final offer.  If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to move on to other options.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're running out of room to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",910000.0,Bob,8,
