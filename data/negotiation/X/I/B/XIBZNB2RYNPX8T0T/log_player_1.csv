Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** The minimum you'll accept is $1,000,000 (from John).
* **Bob's Perceived Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000. Any price within this range can be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming high within the ZOPA is sensible. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message starts by highlighting the product's value and exclusivity, framing it positively.
* **Strong but Negotiable Price:** $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while securing a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **No Justification:**  Avoid providing reasons for the price unless Bob asks. This keeps the conversation focused on his needs and valuation.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower within the ZOPA.
* **Relationship Value:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a slightly less aggressive approach could be beneficial."
