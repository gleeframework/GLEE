"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. It's a significant markup from my minimum value, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  This allows for some negotiating room and potentially a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $150 is a decent price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a price closer to $180 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $170. This is a compromise from my initial asking price, but still allows for a reasonable profit. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in this offer and agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $160.  While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, we're now at a price that is acceptable to me and still leaves me with a significant profit.  With only 6 rounds left, there's a good chance I could miss out on this deal altogether."
