"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. Could you do $17,000? I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I agree it's a good product, $17,000 is still out of my budget. How about $10,000?  That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget, but I need to be closer to $15,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,000? That's my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can do $11,000, and that's really pushing it.  What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen - $12,000, and we have a deal.",12000.0,Alice,7,
