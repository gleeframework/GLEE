"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price is still fair considering the product's value to me and would allow for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
