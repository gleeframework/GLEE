"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's high enough to give me a decent profit, but it also leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could we possibly meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $975,000 is a better offer than $900,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to sell at a loss, and John is a reliable buyer who will pay my minimum.  I will counteroffer in the next round, but if Bob rejects that, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 just isn't enough. I'm prepared to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to recover a significant portion of the value of this unique product.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price, but I don't see much room for him to go higher.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I will go ahead and sell to him to secure the deal."
