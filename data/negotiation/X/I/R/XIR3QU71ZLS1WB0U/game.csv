"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could we possibly meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 just isn't enough. I'm prepared to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to recover a significant portion of the value of this unique product.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
