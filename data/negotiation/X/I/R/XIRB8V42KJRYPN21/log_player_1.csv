"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so I'm offering a price that's higher, but still within the realm of reason.  We'll see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,400,000 is too low for me, considering the product's worth to both of us. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to be more reasonable, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit.  $1,600,000 is a fair compromise, and I believe Bob will be more likely to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting more and more aggressive with his offers, but I'm still holding out for a better price.  $1,350,000 is simply too low for me. I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still trying to get as much as possible.  $1,550,000 is a fair compromise, and I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer.  If not, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly unreasonable, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I've already made a significant concession, but it seems like he's just trying to take advantage.  To avoid further frustration and ensure I get a decent profit, I'm going to sell the product to John.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum requirements."
