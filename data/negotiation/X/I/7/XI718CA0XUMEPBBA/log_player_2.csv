"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $10,000 from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $11,000.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $12,000, and you're willing to pay up to $10,000.  A counteroffer of $9,500 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $10,800, which is still higher than what you're willing to pay from John ($10,000). It's better to buy the product from John to ensure the best possible price."
