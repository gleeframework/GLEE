"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something around $950,000. Would that be feasible for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'll make a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and my initial offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
