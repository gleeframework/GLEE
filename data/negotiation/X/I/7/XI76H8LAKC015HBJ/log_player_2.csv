"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, you have a margin to work with. Rejecting her offer and proposing a counteroffer lower than $1,100,000 allows you to potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower offer ($900,000) leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility on price. This strategy aims to maximize potential savings while still showing genuine interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price range, but there's still potential for negotiation.  By rejecting this offer and countering, you can try to close the gap further and secure a price closer to $1,000,000. You're still a comfortable distance away from John's $1,200,000 backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something around $950,000. Would that be feasible for you?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to split the difference between Alice's current offer ($1,050,000) and your previous offer ($900,000).  This shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'll make a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, and her current offer of $1,025,000 is a good deal. While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk that Alice might walk away from the negotiation, leaving you to buy from John at the higher price. Accepting this offer secures a significant saving compared to John's price and avoids the risk of losing out on the deal entirely."
