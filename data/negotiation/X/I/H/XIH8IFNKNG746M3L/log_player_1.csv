Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob ($80). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Asking for Feedback:**  By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm opening the door for Bob to make a counteroffer and begin the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value for Me:**  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. Bob is interested in the product, and $90 is closer to my desired price than his initial offer.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  Selling to John at $100 would guarantee me my minimum value, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $105? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reinforcing the product's value with the phrase ""worth every penny,"" hoping to make Bob feel more confident about the price. 
* **Maintain Margin:** $105 is still above my minimum value of $100, giving me a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $105. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum.  John is willing to pay $100, guaranteeing me my desired profit.  It's time to move on and secure the sale with John."
