"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $120 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $145?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $130?",130.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $130 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  This would be a great price for both of us and I'm sure you'll love the product.",140.0,Alice,5,
