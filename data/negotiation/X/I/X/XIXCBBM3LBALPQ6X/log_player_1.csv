{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $175, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and positive tone might encourage Bob to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not going straight for my minimum of $150, as this leaves more room for potential bargaining and a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $120 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** While Bob is showing interest, I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can likely get closer to my desired price. 
* **Maintaining Control:** Rejecting Bob's offer gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and control the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $120 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $145?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering a counter-proposal that's closer to my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Compromise:**  Suggesting a ""middle ground"" price of $145 shows that I'm willing to be flexible but also maintains a firm stance on the value of the product.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and encourages continued dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to undervalue the product.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's still a gap between our positions. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Control:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $130 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  This would be a great price for both of us and I'm sure you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer of $145 and Bob's offer of $130. It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** Emphasizing that this price would be ""great for both of us"" and highlighting the value of the product encourages Bob to see the deal as mutually beneficial.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $140 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I'm not jeopardizing my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. Would you be willing to go down to $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $135 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still not quite there. 
* **Time is Money:** We've been negotiating for a while, and I don't want to risk further delays or the potential for a lower final price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John is offering me a guaranteed $150, which is both my minimum and a secure way to ensure a profitable sale.  

I'm choosing to sell to John to avoid potentially further negotiation and ensure a sale that meets my minimum profit requirement."
