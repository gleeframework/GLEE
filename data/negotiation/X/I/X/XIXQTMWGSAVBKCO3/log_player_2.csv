"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $13,000 might have been a bit high, $6,000 is too low for a product of this quality.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Let's try to wrap this up. Would you be willing to do $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no point in continuing the negotiation.  You're better off taking the guaranteed lower price from John."
