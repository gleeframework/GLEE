{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation but still ensuring a profit. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its market value. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 for this product.  It's still a fantastic deal for you, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,125,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $1,125,000 is still below my ideal price, it's only a small difference from my minimum and accepting it ensures a sale. It's likely that further negotiation would result in a price closer to my minimum, but there's no guarantee. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is tempting, but the risk of Bob making a counteroffer that I'd then have to decline is too high. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and relatively satisfactory outcome."
