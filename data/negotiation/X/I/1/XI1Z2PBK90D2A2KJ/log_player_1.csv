Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique chance"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, he may not be willing to pay significantly more. You need to gauge his willingness to go above that price.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a negotiation strategy in mind will help you maximize your profit."
