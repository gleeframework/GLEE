"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I understand its worth to you is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its value while allowing for a fair profit for myself.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a substantial discount from what it's worth to you, and I'm confident it's a very competitive offer. Please consider it carefully, as I'm sure you'll agree this is a great opportunity.
