"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're working within a budget. While $8,500 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still leaves me with a fair profit, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $9,000. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'd like to propose $8,750. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider this offer?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer.  $8,875 is my final price.  If it works for you, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",8875.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm not comfortable going above $8,750. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer. I'd like to propose $8,750, and I'm willing to accept that as the final price. Can you consider this offer?",8750.0,Bob,6,
