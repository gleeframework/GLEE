{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's below my minimum acceptable price but above Bob's estimated value, allowing for potential bargaining.
* **Shows confidence:**  A firm offer shows you believe in the product's value and aren't desperate to sell.
* **Includes a friendly message:**  This can help establish rapport and keep the negotiation positive."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I'm confident I can secure a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're working within a budget. While $8,500 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still leaves me with a fair profit, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $9,000. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'd like to propose $8,750. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's getting closer, I believe I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer.  $8,875 is my final price.  If it works for you, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 8875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm not comfortable going above $8,750. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer. I'd like to propose $8,750, and I'm willing to accept that as the final price. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made several concessions.  It's clear we're not going to agree on a price that works for both of us. To avoid further negotiation, I'll take John's offer of $10,000."
