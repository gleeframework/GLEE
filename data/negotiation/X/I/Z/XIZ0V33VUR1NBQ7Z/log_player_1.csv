While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,530,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  We're still well above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 and securing a profit of $330,000 over my minimum is a strong outcome.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate risks creating tension. Accepting now preserves a positive relationship.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the capital available for other opportunities sooner.

Delaying further and potentially losing Bob as a buyer isn't worth the risk of only gaining a marginally higher amount, especially considering John's standing offer is significantly lower."
