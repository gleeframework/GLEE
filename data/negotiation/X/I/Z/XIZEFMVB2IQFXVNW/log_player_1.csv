{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay a significant amount. We're still in early rounds, and holding firm at this stage might encourage him to make a more substantial jump in the next round.  We're aiming to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer increases are getting smaller ($10,000 then $5,000), and he's now moving further away from our target price. This indicates his willingness to pay is significantly lower than our desired outcome. It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap to a satisfactory price. Selling to John guarantees our minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
