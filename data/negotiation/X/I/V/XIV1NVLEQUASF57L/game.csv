,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a good deal.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think $92 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you consider that?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $92 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference again. How about $93.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",93.5,Alice,5,
