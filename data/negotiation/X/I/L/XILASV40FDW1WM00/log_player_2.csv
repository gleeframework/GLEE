"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is way too high. It's better to negotiate or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming to pay no more than $120, but starting with a lower counteroffer leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Open:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages Alice to continue the bargaining process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see if I can do a bit better. However, I need to make a profit, so I can only go up to $160. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit, but $160 is still too high compared to John's offer of $120.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $130?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice moved a bit, so it's good to show willingness to compromise too.  $130 is a significant jump from my last offer, but still keeps me under my $120 ideal.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, mentioning a ""fair deal"" subtly reminds Alice that I have other options (John)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can see we're not too far apart. I can do $145, but I really think I should get at least a bit more for this amazing product. Let me see if I can stretch a bit further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice is moving down slowly. We're still $25 away from her starting price and significantly above John's offer.
* **Leverage:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Alice might be more willing to make a larger concession as we get closer to the end."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to offer $135, but that's my final offer.  I need to make a decision soon."",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** I'm setting a hard limit and conveying a sense of urgency. This lets Alice know I'm serious and won't budge much further.
* **Slight Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly to show that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but only a little.
* **Alternative Option:**  The phrase ""I need to make a decision soon"" subtly reminds her of John's offer without explicitly threatening to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to make a deal, Bob, but I need to be careful about how much I compromise. I can meet you halfway between $135 and $145, so I'm willing to do $140. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $140. She's signaled this is her ""lowest"" price. 
* **Time Pressure:** We only have a few rounds left, and further negotiation with Alice might not yield significant savings. 
* **Guaranteed Savings:** John's offer of $120 is a sure thing. While I might be able to squeeze a few more dollars out of Alice, it's not worth the risk of ending up with nothing. 

It's better to cut my losses and take John's offer."
