"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see if I can do a bit better. However, I need to make a profit, so I can only go up to $160. Is that something you'd be interested in?",160.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $130?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",130.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can see we're not too far apart. I can do $145, but I really think I should get at least a bit more for this amazing product. Let me see if I can stretch a bit further.",145.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to offer $135, but that's my final offer.  I need to make a decision soon.",135.0,Bob,6,,

"I can see you're really trying to make a deal, Bob, but I need to be careful about how much I compromise. I can meet you halfway between $135 and $145, so I'm willing to do $140. That's the lowest I can go.",140.0,Alice,7,,
