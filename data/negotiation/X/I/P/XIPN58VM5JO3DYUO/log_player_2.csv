```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,500 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000

While $7,000 is a better price, I'll try to negotiate a bit further. I'm aiming to stay significantly below John's price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $6,500?  That's a fair deal for both of us."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,500 is a bit more reasonable, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $6,800. It's a slight compromise, but I think it's worth it for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come up slightly, and we're getting close to the point where further haggling might not be worth the potential savings. $6,800 is a good deal compared to John's $8,000."
