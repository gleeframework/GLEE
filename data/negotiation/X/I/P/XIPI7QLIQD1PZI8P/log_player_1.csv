{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,490,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1490000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy for $1,500,000, the goal is to get the highest price possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so we need to offer a price significantly lower than John's offer to be enticing.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The mention of ""other interested parties"" and a ""one-time offer"" creates urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

By offering the product at $1,490,000, we aim to capture a significant portion of the value difference between Bob's valuation and John's guaranteed purchase."
