Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000.  Here's my reasoning:

* **My minimum:** I know I can get $1,500,000 from John, so that's my floor.
* **Potential gain:** I'm hoping Bob values the product more than me, so I'm aiming for a significant profit.
* **Risk assessment:** If Bob rejects, I lose nothing, as I have a guaranteed buyer in John.

By offering a higher price, I maximize my potential earnings while ensuring I won't lose money if Bob isn't interested."
