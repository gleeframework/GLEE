"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to your limit, you can still potentially save more by negotiating with Alice.  You have room to counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, showing your commitment to saving money.  It's also a good starting point for negotiation, as it leaves some room for Alice to counter without dropping below your maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum, but it's closer than her previous offer.  I can try to negotiate further and see if I can get her down to a price I'm comfortable with. There is still room for a counteroffer to potentially save more money than going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,300,000.  This is still within my budget and shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but it also demonstrates that I'm not willing to accept Alice's previous offer.  This counteroffer might be more appealing to Alice than my previous one, making her more likely to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now too high for me, and it's clear that she's not willing to come down to a price that works for me.  I've already countered twice, and it doesn't seem like further negotiation will be successful.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is within my budget and saves me money compared to accepting Alice's offer."
