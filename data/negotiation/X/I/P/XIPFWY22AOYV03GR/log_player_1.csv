Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

Bob is not budging from $90, and it's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap. It's time to take the guaranteed $100 from John."
