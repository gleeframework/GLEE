"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and will greatly benefit your business. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product and its potential benefits. While I'm interested, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to start. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, while also allowing for a healthy profit margin for you. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. After re-evaluating the market and considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value while also acknowledging your desire for a healthy profit margin. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
