"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it's a perfect fit for you. My asking price is $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives us room to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $15,000, but I'm willing to go lower if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum of $15,000. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm making a slight concession, but still keeping the price above my minimum. Hopefully, this will be a more enticing offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  $13,500 is closer to my minimum but I'm going to try to get a little more.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $13,500 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's above my minimum. I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to get him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I've already spent five rounds negotiating and we're still $1,000 apart.  I've also gone down from my initial offer of $18,000, and I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate may not yield a better offer from Bob.  John is a guaranteed $15,000, which is above my minimum.  I'm going to sell the product to John."
