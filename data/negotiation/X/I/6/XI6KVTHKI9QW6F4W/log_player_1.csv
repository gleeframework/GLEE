Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product and has a budget that allows for a high price. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and my assessment of his negotiating style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not satisfied with it. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, but it still leaves some room for potential negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to go lower, but I'll also be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob is not willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's close to my minimum acceptable price and it avoids the risk of going back and forth with Bob further.  I also don't want to risk selling to John for less than what Bob is offering."
