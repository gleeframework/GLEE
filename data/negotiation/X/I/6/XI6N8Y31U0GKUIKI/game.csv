"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $9,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice. How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $8,500? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,5,
