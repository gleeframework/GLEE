"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, so paying $11,000 is not a good deal.  It's better to reject and try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Alice's price is still a bit higher than what Bob ideally wants to pay, it's only $500 more than what he'd pay for the same product from John.  Accepting the offer means getting the product and potentially saving time and effort on further negotiation."
