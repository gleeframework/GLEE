"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
