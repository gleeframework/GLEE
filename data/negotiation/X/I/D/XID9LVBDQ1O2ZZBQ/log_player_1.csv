Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still get a good price.  I'm also keeping in mind that John is a backup buyer, ensuring I won't settle for less than $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."

{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. This is still a decent profit for me and shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's also a significant jump from Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this will encourage him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good deal, exceeding my minimum acceptable price and getting me closer to my initial goal.  While I could potentially try for more, there's always the risk of him walking away, and I'm happy with this price."
