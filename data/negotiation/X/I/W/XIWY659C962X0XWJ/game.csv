"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see something closer to $900,000. This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be a great asset for your business. Let's find a number that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $825,000 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see at least $875,000 to make this deal worthwhile. This product is truly unique and will be a significant advantage for your business. I believe that price reflects its true value. Let's try to find a middle ground.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $875,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $837,500. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business.",837500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to see at least $856,250 to make this deal work.  This product is truly exceptional, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.",856250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $830,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business.",830000.0,Bob,8,
