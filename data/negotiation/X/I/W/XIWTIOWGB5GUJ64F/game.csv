"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to negotiate?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you consider coming down to $11,000? I believe that would be a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $11,500?  That's a firm offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer the product to you for $12,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12800.0,Alice,7,
