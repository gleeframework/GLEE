"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if we can get a lower price closer to our budget.  We have plenty of rounds to try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

We start with a counter offer considerably lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility and move towards a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice came down to $85, which is within our $80 budget. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Alice might not go lower, and we risk losing the deal. It's better to accept this reasonable offer."
