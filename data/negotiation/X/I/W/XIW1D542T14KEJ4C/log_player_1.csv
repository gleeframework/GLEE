Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting price, reflecting the value I place on the product. I believe it's important to start high and then be prepared to negotiate down.  It's also important to remember that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my floor price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This counteroffer is a significant step down from my original offer but still above Bob's offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise, showing my willingness to negotiate while also ensuring I receive a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $950,000 is not a terrible price, I'm not convinced I can get a better offer from Bob.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. Selling to John guarantees me a solid profit, which is ultimately my goal."
