"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a profit. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering I'm saving you a significant amount compared to your valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a good profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
