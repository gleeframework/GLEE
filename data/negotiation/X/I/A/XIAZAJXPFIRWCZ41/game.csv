"Hi Alice, I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, however, $6,000 is quite low.  Could you do $10,000? That would make it worth it for me.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your understanding, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's the price I was thinking of when I considered buying it from John.",8000.0,Bob,4,
