"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $150. It's a steal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate or go with John directly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my maximum budget ($80) to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Anchoring:**  By offering a low price, I'm trying to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to my desired range. Alice might be more receptive to counteroffers closer to $60 now. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This lowball offer helps me gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she flat-out rejects it, I'll have a better idea of her flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand $150 is a bit high for you, how about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice came down significantly, $110 is still above my $80 maximum and significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Room to Negotiate:** Alice's willingness to move from $150 to $110 suggests she's open to negotiation. I believe I can get a better price. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm keeping in mind that John offers a reliable alternative at $80, preventing me from overpaying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate the offer, but $110 is still a bit beyond my budget. Could you do $70? That would be a great deal for me."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm keeping it well below her current price.
* **Staying Below Maximum:**  $70 keeps me comfortably below my $80 limit, ensuring I don't overpay.
* **Testing the Waters Again:** This offer aims to find a middle ground. Alice's response will reveal if a deal within my budget is possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $70 is too low for me. I could go down to $95, and that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:**  Alice's final offer of $95 is still above my $80 maximum. 
* **John's Offer is Better:**  John's standing offer of $80 is a better deal than Alice's ""final"" price.
* **No More Room to Negotiate:**  Alice has signaled that $95 is her absolute bottom line, making further negotiation unlikely to succeed."
