"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice is starting high. There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards a price closer to her value of $8,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That's a bit steep for me, Alice. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it."",

``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation moving in the right direction. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room to negotiate further while staying well below our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I think the product is worth more than $9,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

``` 

Alice is negotiating, but she's still significantly above her value. We need to signal that we're willing to walk away if she doesn't come down further.  We'll make another counteroffer to encourage her to move closer to her true value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about $9,500? That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

We're inching closer to a potential agreement. By splitting the difference between our previous offer and her counteroffer, we signal that we're still engaged but also firm on getting a good deal.  We're hoping this will encourage Alice to move closer to her value of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500, but I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! Alice has come down considerably, and while we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll walk away.  $10,000 is a full $2,000 under our maximum budget, so we'll accept and secure the product."
