# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?
