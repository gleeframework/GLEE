"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its value, I'm offering it at $2,300,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point considering the potential returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly.  
* **Justification:**  Framing the price around ""value"" and ""potential returns"" emphasizes the benefits to Bob, not just the cost.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While John is a backup, aiming higher initially keeps the option open for a more profitable deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that suits both of us. My counteroffer is $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than the initial ask.  Rejecting at this stage:

* **Maintains a strong position:**  Shows you're not desperate to accept the first counteroffer.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Signals willingness to find a compromise, but not at a major loss.
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing John is a guaranteed $1,500,000 provides a safety net, allowing for bolder counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $1,800,000 is a tempting offer,  the value this product brings justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Not Drastic Reduction:** Coming down $200,000 shows flexibility while still emphasizing the product's value.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** Aims for a price point closer to the midpoint between the previous offer and counteroffer.
* **Positive Framing:** Emphasizing ""fair compromise"" and ""mutual benefit"" encourages a collaborative approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. My counteroffer is now at $1,950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concessions:** Bob is moving slowly, indicating a willingness to negotiate further. Accepting now might leave money on the table.
* **Still Above John:** $1,950,000 is a good offer, but it's still worth risking another round to try and get closer to $2 million, knowing John provides a safety net. 
* **Time for a Different Tactic:** Continually countering in a linear way might not be the most effective. The next counter should aim to understand Bob's motivations better or introduce new information to justify a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a strong return on your investment. To be frank, $1,950,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for.  However, I'm always open to finding creative solutions. Is there anything specific preventing you from going higher? Perhaps we can address that together. Otherwise, my offer stands at $2,050,000."", 
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Open Communication:** Instead of just another counteroffer, this encourages dialogue and understanding Bob's potential limitations.
* **Problem-Solving Approach:** By seeking the root cause of the price discrepancy, it might open avenues for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Small Concession:**  Dropping to $2,050,000 shows continued willingness to negotiate but maintains a strong position.
* **Alternative Option:** Leaving the previous offer on the table provides a clear fallback if Bob is unwilling to budge or share more information."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your openness, Alice. Let me think about this for a moment and get back to you with a final offer. For now, my counteroffer is at $2,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $2,000,000 is a significant profit, representing a 33% increase over John's offer and a solid return on the product.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob's language suggests he's reaching his upper limit and unlikely to go much higher.
* **Time Value & Risk:**  Dragging negotiations further introduces uncertainty. Accepting now secures a great deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
