"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for presenting this opportunity. While I recognize the value of the product, the price point of $2,000,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm confident that it can generate substantial returns for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $1,250,000? I feel that's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be fair to both of us.  $1,400,000 is my final offer - it splits the difference between our last two offers and represents a significant discount on my initial asking price. I believe this is a very fair deal for you considering the value this product brings.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
