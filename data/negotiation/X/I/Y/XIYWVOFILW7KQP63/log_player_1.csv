Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for presenting this opportunity. While I recognize the value of the product, the price point of $2,000,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
