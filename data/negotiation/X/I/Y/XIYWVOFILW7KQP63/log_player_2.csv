# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for presenting this opportunity. While I recognize the value of the product, the price point of $2,000,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm confident that it can generate substantial returns for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $1,250,000? I feel that's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be fair to both of us.  $1,400,000 is my final offer - it splits the difference between our last two offers and represents a significant discount on my initial asking price. I believe this is a very fair deal for you considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, she's unlikely to go much lower than $1,400,000.  You can get the product for a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
