Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy your product. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,050,000.  I believe this price is still fair for both of us, and it would allow me to make this investment work for my business.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This price is a good compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.
