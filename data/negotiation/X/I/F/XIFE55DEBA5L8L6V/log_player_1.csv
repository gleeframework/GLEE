Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential win-win scenario where I get a good price, and Bob still gets a deal.  I'm also leaving room to lower the price if Bob makes a counteroffer that I find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
