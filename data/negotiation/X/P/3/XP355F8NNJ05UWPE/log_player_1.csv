Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even slightly more.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $149 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle, while still ensuring you make a significant profit.
* **Strategic Messaging:** The message implies value without revealing your minimum price, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
