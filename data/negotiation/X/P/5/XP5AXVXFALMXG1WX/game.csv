"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $125. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll sell it to you for $150. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",150.0,Alice,3,
