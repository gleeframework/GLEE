Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming for a price between Bob's value ($1,000,000) and John's offer allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Offering a price closer to John's offer creates a sense of urgency and value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate, increasing the chances of closing a deal. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to potentially earn a higher profit. If Alice wants to guarantee the sale, she should offer the product to Bob for $1,000,000."
