"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $18,000 is still outside my price range. I'm firm on my offer of $12,000.  Let's find a way to make this work, or I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $12,000 offer.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed $15,000 offer."
