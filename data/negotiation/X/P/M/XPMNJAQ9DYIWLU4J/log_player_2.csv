Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have other options, Bob, but I'd like to remind you that this product is unique and has its own value. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's the best I can do.

Alice is very unlikely to go below her stated minimum of $10,250. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000, which meets your maximum price.  It's time to take that offer."
