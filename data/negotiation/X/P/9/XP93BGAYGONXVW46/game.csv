"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $82. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a little too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $75.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $79. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",79.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $79 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying, but I'm willing to meet you at $77.  It's a fair price, and I believe we can close this deal.",77.0,Bob,6,
