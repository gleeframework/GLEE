Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $15,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation. If Bob counters, you can potentially settle closer to $15,000 while still exceeding his perceived value. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The safety net of selling to John for $15,000 means you don't have to desperately lowball the price to Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know your absolute minimum price. 
* It's a starting point for negotiation. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and any additional information you gather."
