"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations by offering it to you for $1,800,000. This product is in high demand and I believe this price reflects its true value.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your time and effort. However, I think the product is worth less than $1,800,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the market value of similar products.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is below my acceptable range. This product offers unique advantages, and I'm confident it can generate significant value for your business. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,650,000. How about we try $1,525,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,525,000 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's try $1,575,000. This is a small adjustment, but I believe it's a fair reflection of what we're both looking for.",1575000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my target. How about we try $1,500,000? I believe this is the maximum I can go, and I hope you can meet me halfway.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
