Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,525,000 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's try $1,575,000. This is a small adjustment, but I believe it's a fair reflection of what we're both looking for.
