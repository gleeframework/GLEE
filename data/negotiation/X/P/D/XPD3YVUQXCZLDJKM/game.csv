"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $155?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try $145. That's a small step closer to your offer, and still gives me a little room to make a profit.  What do you say?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my budget. However, $145 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $135? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to go down to $140.  This is my final offer, so let's see if we can finally agree on a price.",140.0,Alice,7,
