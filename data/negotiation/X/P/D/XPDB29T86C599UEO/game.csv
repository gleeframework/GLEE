"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,350,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course, but I believe this is a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to see some flexibility from your end.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and I'm confident it can generate even more than $1,500,000 for you. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to see some more flexibility from your end.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I sense your enthusiasm for the product's potential. How about this: to show I'm serious about finding an agreement, I'll come down to $1,275,000.  This is a very competitive offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,225,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the value the product brings to the table. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to see some more flexibility from your end.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
