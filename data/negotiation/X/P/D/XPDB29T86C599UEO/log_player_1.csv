Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to see some flexibility from your end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and I'm confident it can generate even more than $1,500,000 for you. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product. Let me know your thoughts."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,225,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the value the product brings to the table. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to see some more flexibility from your end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is consistently meeting me halfway and we're now at $1,225,000. This is a significant profit above my minimum and the risk of continued negotiation pushing the price lower or him walking away isn't worth the potential gain at this point."
