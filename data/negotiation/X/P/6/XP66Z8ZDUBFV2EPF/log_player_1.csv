Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $125. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer gives me a profit of $25, which is better than selling to John for $150, but also allows for some potential negotiation with Bob. If Bob accepts, I get a quick sale and a decent profit. If he rejects, I can fall back on John's offer for a higher profit."
