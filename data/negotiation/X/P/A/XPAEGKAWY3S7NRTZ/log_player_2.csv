The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice's offer is $175, so I will reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $140. It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.

While $140 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget of $100. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further."
