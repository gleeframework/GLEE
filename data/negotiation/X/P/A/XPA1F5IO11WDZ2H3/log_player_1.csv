Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm asking for $1,400,000, which reflects its true worth. "",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is a strong offer. It's a substantial amount above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for him to see it as a potential bargain. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The knowledge of John's offer provides a strong safety net. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm still guaranteed my minimum desired amount."
