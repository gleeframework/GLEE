"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $13,500 just doesn't work for me. How about we settle on $14,500? It's a fair compromise and a great deal for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
