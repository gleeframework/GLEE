"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the pricing. While $800000 is lower than my initial offer, it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1200000 to reflect your budget and my desire to reach a deal. This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're open to this revised offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned and my budget constraints. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,4,
