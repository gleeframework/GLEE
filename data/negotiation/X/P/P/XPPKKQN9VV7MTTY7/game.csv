"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $12000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for it, which is still a fair price considering what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $9250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9250. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $10000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
