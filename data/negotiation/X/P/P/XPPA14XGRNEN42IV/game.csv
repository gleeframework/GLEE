"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $700000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $775000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the unique features it offers.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $775000 is the best price for the product. I'd like to meet you in the middle, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $725000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the unique features it offers.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $750000.
