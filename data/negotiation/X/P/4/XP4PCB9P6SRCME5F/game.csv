"I've made several concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1075000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1075000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to offer $950000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,10,
