"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've proposed. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. I hope we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $875,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good compromise considering the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on my investment.",875000.0,Alice,5,
