# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $875,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good compromise considering the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on my investment.

You should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $875,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. While you could continue negotiating, it's unlikely that Alice will come down to your desired price. It's best to secure the product from John at the agreed-upon price."
