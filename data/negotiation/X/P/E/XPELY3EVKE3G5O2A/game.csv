"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value and your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $600,000?  That would seal the deal for me.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value and the effort you've put into this negotiation, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $650,000 is still a bit more than I hoped to spend. I'm willing to offer you $625,000. That's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can close the deal with this.",625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $625,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to sacrifice any more value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $650,000 and $625,000. I'm offering the product to you for $637,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",637500.0,Alice,7,
