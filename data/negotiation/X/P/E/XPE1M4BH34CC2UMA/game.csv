"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product, as that's my maximum budget. Let me know if you're interested in that price.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still above my budget. I'm firm on $80. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider other options.",80.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on $80, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to go down to $110, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let me know!",110.0,Alice,5,
