"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product.  What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fair price for the value the product provides.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This is a fair price considering I'm willing to buy the product now.  Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $15,500, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $16,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product provides.",16000.0,Alice,5,
