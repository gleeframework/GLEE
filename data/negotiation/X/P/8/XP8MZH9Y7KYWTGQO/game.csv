"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its inherent value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that price. How about we bring it down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I still think $1,200,000 is too high.  I'm willing to come up to $750,000.  This is a fair offer that reflects the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I need to be fair to the value of this product. Let's settle this right now - $1,000,000, my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
