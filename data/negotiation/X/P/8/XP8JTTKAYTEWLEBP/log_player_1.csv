{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for the best possible outcome. However, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, leaving room for negotiation.  I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While $140 is closer to my budget, I'm still looking for a slightly more affordable option. Could we meet at $130?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150, I'm hoping to secure a slightly higher price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
