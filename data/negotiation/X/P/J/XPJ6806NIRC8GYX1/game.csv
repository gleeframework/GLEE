"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. While I think your product has potential, $1000000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position.  While $750000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This price still reflects the significant value of this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $900000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $825000.  This is a fair offer that recognizes the value of the product while also staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
