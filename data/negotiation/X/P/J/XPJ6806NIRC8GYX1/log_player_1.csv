"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  I believe it has significant value and this is a great opportunity for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob's value for the product is unknown. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using positive language to highlight the potential value and opportunity for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message implies that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer if he's interested. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and how the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. While I think your product has potential, $1000000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** Although this offer is below my minimum, there's still room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a better price than $750,000.
* **Selling to John:** While I could sell to John for $800,000, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can secure a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will send Bob a counteroffer that is higher than his offer but lower than my initial asking price. I'll aim for a price somewhere between $800,000 and $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position.  While $750,000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price still reflects the significant value of this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm making a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect of my offer. 
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm using language that suggests a desire to close the deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

I'm using a gradual approach to negotiation. By lowering my price incrementally, I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise.  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to consider whether to lower my price further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $900000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $825000.  This is a fair offer that recognizes the value of the product while also staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $825,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Closing Opportunity:** This is a good opportunity to close the deal and avoid further rounds of negotiation.
* **Risk of Lower Offer:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer even further, potentially below my minimum price. 

**Conclusion:**

While I might be able to squeeze out a slightly higher price with more rounds of negotiation, I'm choosing to accept this offer and secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements."
