"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000.  I believe it has significant value and this is a great opportunity for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always best to try and negotiate a better price.  Since Bob's maximum is $1,000,000, there's room to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. While I think your product has potential, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, so a significant initial counteroffer is strategic. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $750,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving space for both parties to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Staying Within Budget:** This counteroffer keeps Bob within his $1,000,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position.  While $750000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This price still reflects the significant value of this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob should continue to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $825,000.  This is a fair offer that recognizes the value of the product while also staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:** Bob is showing that he's serious about getting a good deal without being unreasonable. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $825,000 is a compromise that shows Bob is willing to budge while still aiming for a significant savings.
* **Staying Within Budget:** This offer keeps Bob within his $1,000,000 limit."
