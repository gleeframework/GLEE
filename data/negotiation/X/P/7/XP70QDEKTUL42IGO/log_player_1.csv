Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This allows room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice provides a subtle justification for the high price without revealing her true minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, but rather invites Bob's input and potential counter-offers.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  While Alice has John as a backup, it's strategically better not to mention him.  Revealing a guaranteed sale at $10,000 weakens Alice's negotiating position."
