"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer you $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me while ensuring a fair profit for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This price is closer to your budget, but still reflects the value of the product to me.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
