"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a stronger commitment from your side. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still valuing the product fairly.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. However, considering my financial constraints, I am unable to agree to $1,025,000. Let's aim for a compromise. Would $975,000 be acceptable to you?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. $975,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,000,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $985,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us.",985000.0,Bob,6,
