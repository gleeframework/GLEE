{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This product is worth more to Alice than it is to me, so I'm going to try to negotiate a better price.  $11,000 is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's closer to my maximum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Alice will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still aiming to save as much as I can, and $9,500 is still too high for me. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but I'm still leaving some room for Alice to come down a bit. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
