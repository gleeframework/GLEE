"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $9000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $12500. This is the lowest price I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $11000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $11000. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that's enough to justify the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $13000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm starting to feel that if we can't agree on a price, I should explore other opportunities. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I can only go up to $11500. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm getting close to considering other options, but I still think this product could be a great fit for me. Can we meet in the middle?",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $11500. I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm still not convinced that's enough to meet my minimum price. I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a point where I should consider other opportunities. However, I'm willing to make one final push to try to reach a deal. I'm counteroffering at $14000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to explore other options. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,
