"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $850,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $825,000. This is as close as I can get to meeting you in the middle, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $825,000 secures a significant saving compared to John's $1,000,000 price."
