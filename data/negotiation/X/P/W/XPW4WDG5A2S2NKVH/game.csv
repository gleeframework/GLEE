"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider coming down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $850,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land closer to my budget. How about we split the difference again and settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $825,000. This is as close as I can get to meeting you in the middle, considering the product's value to me.",825000.0,Alice,5,
