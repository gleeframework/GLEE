```

**Reasoning:**

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  I believe this price still reflects the value of the product while accommodating your budget.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.

```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not quite there with $1,200,000. It's important for me to get a price that reflects the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,400,000. I believe this price is fair and leaves room for both of us to gain from this deal.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is a significant compromise for me. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual increase:**  I'm increasing my offer again, but by a smaller amount ($100,000) this time. This signals to Alice that I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still willing to negotiate.
