Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,800,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a lower price, and I'm offering $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

While I could continue negotiating and try for a higher price, Bob is consistently moving upwards and we are now at a price point that is a significant gain over my minimum. Accepting this offer represents a good balance of risk and reward."
