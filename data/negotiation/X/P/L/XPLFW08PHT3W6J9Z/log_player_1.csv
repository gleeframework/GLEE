Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $9,000 is too low for me at this point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this deal worthwhile. I'm offering the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value and potential you'll gain from it. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $10,250 is close enough to my minimum price that I'm willing to accept it.  I'm happy to have the deal done and move on."
