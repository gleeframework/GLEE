"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given my budget and the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 to meet you halfway. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's work together to close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000, which is a significant offer considering my maximum budget. I hope we can reach an agreement on this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. While your offer is getting closer, $1,150,000 is still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product at $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and your budget constraints. I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're still holding out for a higher price, but I'm really pushing the limit of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,175,000. I'm confident this is a fair compromise, and it's the most I can realistically offer.  Let's close this deal!",1175000.0,Bob,6,
