"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 3

Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000, which is a significant offer considering my maximum budget. I hope we can reach an agreement on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. While your offer is getting closer, $1,150,000 is still not quite there.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're still holding out for a higher price, but I'm really pushing the limit of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,175,000. I'm confident this is a fair compromise, and it's the most I can realistically offer.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
