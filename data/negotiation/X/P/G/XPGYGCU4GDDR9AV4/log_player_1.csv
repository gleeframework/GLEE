{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still a good value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  $800,000 is too low for me, even though it's above his initial value. I'll see if I can get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
