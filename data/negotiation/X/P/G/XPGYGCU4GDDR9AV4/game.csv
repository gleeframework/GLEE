"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still a good value for you. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. Let's see if we can make this work.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
