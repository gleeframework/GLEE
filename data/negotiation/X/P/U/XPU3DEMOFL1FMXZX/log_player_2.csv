Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you in the middle, though. My revised offer is $9,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to consider it.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, and I'm willing to consider your offer of $7,000. However, I'd like to make one more counteroffer. I can meet you at $8,200. I think this is a fair price that's closer to my minimum, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

Alice is very unlikely to go below $8,000. It's better to buy from John for $8,000 and avoid the risk of Alice increasing her price in the next round."
