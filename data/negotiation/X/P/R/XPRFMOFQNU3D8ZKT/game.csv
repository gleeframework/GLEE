"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to pursue.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This would still leave you with a healthy profit, and it's a fair price considering my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850000. Considering the product's value to you is $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves room for profit for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,
