"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $8,000.  I'm willing to start with an offer of $8,000. Let's see if we can work something out.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident it can bring you significant benefits.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $18,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I value meeting the needs of my customers, $10,000 is still too low for me to consider.  If we could agree on $14,000, I'd be willing to close the deal today.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a significant compromise for me, so I hope you'll consider it.",12000.0,Bob,6,
