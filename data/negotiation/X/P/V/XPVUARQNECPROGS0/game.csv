"Hi Alice,  $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $12000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $12000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $13500.  This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to find common ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you consider $13000?  That would be a great price for both of us, and I'm sure we could close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
