"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,275,000. This is a very fair price that allows for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident that this is a price we can agree on.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000, but I need a bit more. I can offer it to you for $1,325,000. This is a compromise that takes into account the value you place on the product and my target price. What are your thoughts?",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still hesitant about $1,325,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,295,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still staying within a reasonable range for me. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1295000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to consider $1,300,000, but I need to think about the value I'm bringing to the table. I can offer it to you for $1,320,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product. What are your thoughts?",1320000.0,Alice,7,
