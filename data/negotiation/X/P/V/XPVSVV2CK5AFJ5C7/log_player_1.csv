{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale. I'm asking for $200 for it. It's a steal, considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I've started with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This allows for some room to negotiate down if Bob counters with a lower offer. I've also used a positive and encouraging tone in my message to hopefully create a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$80 is far too low for me. I'll counter with a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is way too low for this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $170. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

$120 is still too low, but it's getting closer.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $120 just doesn't cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to go down to $140, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a fair price for the product, but I really need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for it, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Can you meet me at this price?

You have three options:

I'm going to sell to John. $130 is very close to my minimum, but I'd rather secure a guaranteed $150 than risk further negotiation with Bob. It's not worth risking a lower sale for the chance of a slightly higher one."
