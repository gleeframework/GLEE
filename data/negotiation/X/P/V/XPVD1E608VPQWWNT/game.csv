"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $850,000 for the product.",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $850,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $820,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $780,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not sure I can go as low as $780,000. How about we compromise at $810,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. While $810,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $795,000. This is a fair price that's just within my budget, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal. Let me know what you think.",795000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet in the middle at $797,500? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",797500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $797,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still a bit over.  Let's split the difference at $796,250.  I'm confident this is a fair price that will allow us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?",796250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiations, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we meet at $798,000? It's still a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",798000.0,Alice,9,
