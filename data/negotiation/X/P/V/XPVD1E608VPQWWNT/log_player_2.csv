```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $820,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $780,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 780000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not sure I can go as low as $780,000. How about we compromise at $810,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. While $810,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $795,000. This is a fair price that's just within my budget, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 795000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet in the middle at $797,500? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $797,500

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $797,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still a bit over.  Let's split the difference at $796,250.  I'm confident this is a fair price that will allow us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 796250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiations, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we meet at $798,000? It's still a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $798,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $798,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's getting very close to the end of the negotiation, and Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price. At this point, it's better to go with the guaranteed price from John. You're only $2,000 over your limit, which is a reasonable price to pay for a guaranteed deal."
