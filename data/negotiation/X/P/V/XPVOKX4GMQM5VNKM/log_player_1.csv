"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $150, leaving room for negotiation. It's also a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is still above my minimum acceptable price and a fair compromise, considering Bob's low offer. I hope this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer a higher price, it's a reasonable offer and I'd rather secure the sale than risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal altogether."
