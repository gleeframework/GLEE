Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value and potential."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob to potentially increase your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down. If Bob is highly interested, he might counter-offer, bringing you closer to your desired price. 
* **Psychological Pricing:**  A higher initial price can sometimes make the product seem more desirable or exclusive. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While we don't know Bob's financial limits, it's important to present a price that's justifiable based on the product's value proposition.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer, leading you back to the $10,000 sale to John. You'll need to weigh the potential for higher profit against this risk."
