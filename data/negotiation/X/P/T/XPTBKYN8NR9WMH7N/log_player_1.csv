I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.  It also demonstrates that I believe the product has value beyond my own minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Bob's latest offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, it's below my minimum acceptable price and even lower than what John is offering. I'll take the sure thing and sell to John for $1,200,000."
