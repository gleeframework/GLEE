"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $92 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $100? It's a good deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
