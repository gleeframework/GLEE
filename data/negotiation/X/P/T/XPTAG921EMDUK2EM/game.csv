"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. How about $1,200,000? It's still a great price for a product worth $1,200,000 to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to stay closer to your asking price, but I still think $1,200,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,180,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay.",1180000.0,Bob,4,
