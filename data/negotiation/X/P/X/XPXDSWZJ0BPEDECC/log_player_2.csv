Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of its value. After considering your proposal, I am unable to match the price you've suggested. However, I would like to extend an offer of $825,000 for the product. This is the highest price I can offer while still ensuring a reasonable profit margin for us. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower and is already above John's price.  It makes more sense to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
