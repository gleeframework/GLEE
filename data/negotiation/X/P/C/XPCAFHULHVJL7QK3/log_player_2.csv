Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to push Alice towards a lower price point. $100 is a substantial discount from her initial offer, but still within my budget. If Alice is willing to compromise, I believe this will encourage her to consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to my target price, I'm still hesitant to accept.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if I can get Alice to budge further. There are still several rounds left, and I'm not in a rush to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $105. This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise but still want a better deal than Alice's last offer. This is a more moderate increase than my previous counteroffer, showing flexibility and a willingness to reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is very close to my ideal price, and we're getting near the end of the negotiation. It's likely I won't get a better deal, and I don't want to risk losing the product entirely. It's a good compromise, and I'm confident I've secured a good price."
