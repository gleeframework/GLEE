* **Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $845,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  The negotiation has reached a stalemate, and it's unlikely that Bob will significantly increase his offer.

While I prefer to make a higher profit, it's more important for me to secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements. John's offer provides a reliable and financially advantageous solution."
