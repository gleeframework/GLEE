"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I know will be worth even more to you. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially save more by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. There's a chance Alice might be willing to negotiate further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your desire to sell. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still provides a good value for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is a good price for Bob.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will result in a price closer to Alice's minimum of $1,000,000.  Since Bob's maximum is $1,500,000, accepting the offer at $1,300,000 secures a good deal for Bob and saves him $200,000."
