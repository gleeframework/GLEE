"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way too high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price and my budget. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Direct but Polite:** I'm being direct about the price being too high while maintaining a polite and conversational tone. 
* **Aiming for a Good Deal:** My goal is to get the product well below my $800,000 walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low. I understand you have your budget, but this product is truly unique and offers significant value.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice moved towards a more reasonable price, $900,000 is still above my budget and my walk-away option with John. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get the price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?  I'm serious about this purchase, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** Alice showed a willingness to negotiate by moving significantly from her initial offer. 
* **Strategic Counter:** I'm inching closer to my $800,000 walk-away price while still leaving room for further bargaining.
* **Signaling Seriousness:**  I'm reiterating my interest in the product to encourage Alice to work with me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go any lower than $850,000. This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident it will deliver significant value for your business. It's a fair compromise considering its potential.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I'm still willing to play hardball. There's a chance I can get her down to $800,000, or at least closer, to maximize my savings.  I'm comfortable walking away with John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about this - I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000.  That's a firm offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm proposing a price exactly between her last offer ($850,000) and my target ($800,000). This can be a strong negotiating tactic, especially when paired with...
* **Firm Offer:**  By stating this is my ""firm offer,"" I'm signaling that I'm unlikely to go any higher. This adds a sense of urgency for Alice to accept. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, so putting a bit of pressure on Alice might encourage her to accept a price closer to my terms.
* **Walk-Away Option:** I'm still comfortable walking away and buying from John at $800,000 if Alice rejects this offer."
