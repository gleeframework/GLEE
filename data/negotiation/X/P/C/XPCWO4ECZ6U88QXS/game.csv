"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way too high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you say?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low. I understand you have your budget, but this product is truly unique and offers significant value.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?  I'm serious about this purchase, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go any lower than $850,000. This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident it will deliver significant value for your business. It's a fair compromise considering its potential.  Let's make this deal happen!",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about this - I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000.  That's a firm offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",825000.0,Bob,6,
