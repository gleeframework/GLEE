"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum desired value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** I'm also leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer while still ensuring I receive a profit.
* **Building a Relationship:** I'm being friendly and positive in my message,  trying to establish a positive rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way too high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum desired value ($1,000,000).  I'm not willing to sell for such a low price.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There is room for negotiation.  I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering.
* **John as a Safety Net:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, I want to see if I can potentially get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low. I understand you have your budget, but this product is truly unique and offers significant value.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm counteroffering at $900,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value, emphasizing that it's worth more than $600,000.
* **Finding Common Ground:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a way to find a solution that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?  I'm serious about this purchase, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000).  I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.
* **Further Negotiation:** Bob's offer shows that he's willing to negotiate further. I believe I can push for a higher price with a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, I want to explore if I can get closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go any lower than $850,000. This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident it will deliver significant value for your business. It's a fair compromise considering its potential.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly Reduced Offer:**  I've reduced my price slightly from $900,000 to $850,000, showing I'm willing to compromise. This is still above my minimum desired value ($1,000,000) but closer to Bob's offer.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique qualities and potential for success,  trying to justify the price.
* **Urgency and Closing:** I'm adding a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to close the deal, highlighting the benefits of working together."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about this - I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000.  That's a firm offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum desired value of $1,000,000.  
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and potentially open the door for future business with Bob.  
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, securing a sale at $825,000 is a good outcome considering the limited time and potential for future business."
