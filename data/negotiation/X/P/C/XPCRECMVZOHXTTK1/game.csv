"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,600,000. Would you be willing to consider a lower price closer to my maximum limit of $1,000,000? I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budget limitations, but $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. How about we aim for a compromise at $1,250,000? I believe this price reflects a reasonable midpoint between our positions.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
