"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $15,500? This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us both to be satisfied.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $15,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something under $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",13900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,900 is still a bit low. How about $14,500? This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and allows for a reasonable margin for me.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we are getting closer. To be honest, my budget is $14,000. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",14000.0,Bob,6,
