"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is reflective of the significant return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,200,000 is far beyond your budget of $800,000. It's a good start to negotiate but not a viable option.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially find a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me, and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This still reflects the significant intrinsic value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is still far too high.  It's closer to your desired price, but you're still aiming to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects the product's value to me.  I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's aim to close this gap. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000. I believe this offer represents a significant compromise while still reflecting the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her offer of $1,600,000 is still significantly higher than your budget of $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks further delays and may not result in a price you're comfortable with.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at a price within your budget, it makes the most sense to secure the product from John. You're guaranteed to acquire the product within your financial limits, avoiding potential further negotiation complications."
