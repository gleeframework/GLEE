While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to try and negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. Although $950,000 is still above my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise.  It's worth it to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
