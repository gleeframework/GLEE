"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $120 to Alice, and Alice is offering it for $130. You can likely get a better deal, so it's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me.  How about $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $132.50. This is my best price for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down in price, it's still a bit higher than what you're comfortable with. It's worth seeing if you can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $132.50 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference at $128.75?  I'm confident that we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 128.75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can do $129.25, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, so let me know if it works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $129.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $129.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $129.25 is close to your target of saving as much money as possible.  While you might be able to squeeze out a few more cents, the risk of the negotiation breaking down and having to buy from John for $150 outweighs the potential savings.  It's time to close the deal."
