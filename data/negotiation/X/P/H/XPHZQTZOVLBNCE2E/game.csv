"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me.  How about $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $132.50. This is my best price for now.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $132.50 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference at $128.75?  I'm confident that we can close the deal at this price.",128.75,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can do $129.25, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, so let me know if it works for you.",129.25,Alice,5,
