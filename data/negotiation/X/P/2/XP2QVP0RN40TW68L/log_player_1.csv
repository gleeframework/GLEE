Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $5,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $5,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle? Let's say $13,000."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $13,000 is closer, it's still more than I had in mind.  Would you consider $7,500? That's a substantial increase on my initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, I can still get a better deal from John without wasting more time on haggling.
