"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $5,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $5,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle? Let's say $13,000.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $13,000 is closer, it's still more than I had in mind.  Would you consider $7,500? That's a substantial increase on my initial offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,
