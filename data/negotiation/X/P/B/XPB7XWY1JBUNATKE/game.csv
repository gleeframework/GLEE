"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate it, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is a bit closer to what you're comfortable with. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to go up to $128. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",128.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $126. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, so I'm counteroffering $129. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",129.0,Alice,7,
