Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows her minimum acceptable price is $15,000 (her guaranteed sale to John). Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Testing the Waters:** The $19,000 offer tests Bob's willingness to pay.  
    * **If Bob accepts:** Alice earns a profit above her minimum.
    * **If Bob negotiates:** Alice can gauge how much lower she needs to go.
    * **If Bob rejects:** Alice can still sell to John for her minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limits beyond his valuation of the product."
