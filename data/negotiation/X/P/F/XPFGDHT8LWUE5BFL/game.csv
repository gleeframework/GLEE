"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $8,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $8,500, so I'm thinking $8,750. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $9,000. How about we settle on $8,900? This is my final offer.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,700, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",8700.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be at $8,800. This is my absolute final offer. If we can't agree, I'm going to have to sell to someone else.",8800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $8,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,600, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you consider this offer?",8600.0,Bob,8,
