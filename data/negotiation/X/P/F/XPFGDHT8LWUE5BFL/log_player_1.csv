"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,000. I'll see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $8,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $8,500, so I'm thinking $8,750. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,750 is getting closer to what I want, I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,000. I'll try one more counteroffer and then I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $9,000. How about we settle on $8,900? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,700, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,700 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,000. I'll make one last counteroffer and then I'll sell to John if Bob doesn't agree."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be at $8,800. This is my absolute final offer. If we can't agree, I'm going to have to sell to someone else."", ""product_price"": 8800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $8,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,600, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  I've made several counteroffers and Bob is still not willing to go any higher than $8,600. While that's not a bad price, I'm not going to risk getting stuck at that price when I can get $10,000 from John."
