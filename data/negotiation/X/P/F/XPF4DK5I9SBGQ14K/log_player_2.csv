{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer.  It's still above your budget, but you have a chance to get a better deal by counteroffering.  Since you've already rejected offers at 1,500,000 and 1,400,000, Alice is likely to be willing to negotiate lower to close the deal."

At this point, the negotiations with Alice are getting close to your budget, but it's still not within your desired range. You have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000. It's safer to buy from John and avoid further risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffers."
