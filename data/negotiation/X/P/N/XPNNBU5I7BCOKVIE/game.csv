I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'd like to offer it to you for $13000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?,13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $13000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in discussing that price.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12500. This is my best price, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12500 is closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to pay $12000. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
