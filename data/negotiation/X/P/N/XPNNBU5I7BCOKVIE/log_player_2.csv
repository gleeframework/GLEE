"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'd like to offer it to you for $13000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $13,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in discussing that price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12500. This is my best price, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above his desired price point. Bob has already shown he's willing to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows him to potentially get a price closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,500 is closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to pay $12,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}
