# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to discuss this product with you. It offers significant potential, and I know you've been looking for something like this. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  I believe this price reflects its true value and offers a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Bob can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, which is lower than Alice's offer of $1,400,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option to save money."
