"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Could you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal for you compared to what I could get from another buyer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While I understand the value, I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to a tight budget, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $800,000? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
