"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a fair price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $12,000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",15000.0,Alice,3,
