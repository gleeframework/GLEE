Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $12,000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
