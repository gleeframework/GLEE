"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll really love. I'm looking for $12000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can potentially get the product for a lower price by negotiating. $12,000 is still too high, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is a good price for Bob. It's still below his maximum budget of $15,000, and it's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice walking away entirely is higher. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids unnecessary risk."
