Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. Even if he counters, there's a chance to settle closer to $120.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John provides leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any price.
* **Psychology:**  People often perceive items with higher initial prices as more valuable. This might make Bob more receptive even if he negotiates the price down. 

**Important Note:** While this strategy aims to maximize profit, there's always a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential gain from a higher selling price outweighs the risk of losing the sale to Bob in this scenario."
