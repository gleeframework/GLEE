"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $130 is better than $150, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to come down to $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $130 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $135. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further. If Alice doesn't budge, Bob can always choose to buy from John as a backup."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $135 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a bit lower. Would you consider $130?  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're still looking for a bit of a discount. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you $137.50. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let me know if that works for you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While $137.50 is closer to his desired price point, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth continuing to try and get a better price. If Alice doesn't budge, Bob can always choose to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  While $137.50 is closer, I'm still hoping to land at $132.50. This is a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away happy with the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 132.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're still looking for a bit of a discount. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you $135.25. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm willing to compromise further to get the deal done. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price, but Alice has been consistently meeting him halfway. While $135.25 is still above Bob's ideal price, it's getting very close to his maximum acceptable price ($150 for John's product). With only a few rounds left, it's more likely that Alice won't budge further, so accepting the offer is the best option to avoid risking a deal completely."
