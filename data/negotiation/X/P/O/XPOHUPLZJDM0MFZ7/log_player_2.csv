"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's not worth buying the product from Alice for $90 when I can get it from John for $80. I'll reject the offer and see if Alice will lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

I'll start by offering Alice $75. This is a significant discount from her initial offer, and it's still below my maximum budget. Hopefully, she'll be willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. I'll reject her offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

I'll offer Alice $80, which is my maximum budget.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope she'll accept it. If she doesn't, I'll be forced to buy from John."
