"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you and $100 to Alice.  While Alice's offer of $115 is better than John's price of $120, you can still do better.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from another seller altogether."
