"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
