,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1300000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $1100000.  This is a fair price, considering the value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  I propose a price of $1250000. This represents a good compromise, and it's still a price that is worth it for you, given the value you place on the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1150000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and it's a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. However, $1150000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's go with $1200000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and your budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
