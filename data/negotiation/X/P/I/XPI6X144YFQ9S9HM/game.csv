"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, considering the value I have in mind. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $875,000 is enough. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000 was too high for you, and $925,000 was too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between those two numbers. I'm thinking of a price of $937,500 for the product. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",937500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you getting closer to my price point.  However, $937,500 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is exactly halfway between our last two offers. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer given our respective values.  I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. ",900000.0,Bob,8,
