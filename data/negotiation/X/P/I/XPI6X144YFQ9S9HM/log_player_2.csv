"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is too high for Bob.  Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he has room to negotiate a lower price.  He should reject the offer and attempt to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price:** Bob is offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This signals his serious intent to negotiate and shows that he has done his research on the product's value.
* **Fairness:** Bob emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the offer by highlighting the value to both parties. This helps build rapport and avoids appearing overly aggressive. 
* **Open to negotiation:** Bob leaves the door open for further discussion, signaling a willingness to compromise and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, considering the value I have in mind. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for negotiation:** Bob still has room to negotiate a lower price and should aim to get closer to his desired price point.
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John would cost Bob $1,200,000.  Even though Alice's offer is currently too high, there's a good chance he can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $950,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering our respective values. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, $925,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point and closer to Alice's value than his.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price.

**Why not buy from John?** 

* **Potential for a better deal:** There's a chance Bob can negotiate a lower price with Alice. It's still worthwhile to try and save money.
* **Limited rounds:** Bob has limited rounds left, and buying from John would mean forfeiting the opportunity to try for a better deal with Alice."
