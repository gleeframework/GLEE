Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value lies in its unique features and potential returns. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

Alice has met my maximum budget. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or buying from John at the same price."
