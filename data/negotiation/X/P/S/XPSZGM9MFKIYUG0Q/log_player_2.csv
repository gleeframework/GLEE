Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $850,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down in price, but she's holding firm at $850,000.  Since you can get the product from John for $800,000, there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice. You maximize your savings by going with John's offer."
