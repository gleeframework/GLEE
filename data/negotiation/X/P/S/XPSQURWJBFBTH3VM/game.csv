"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident in its potential to exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I still think $1,650,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,650,000, which would be $1,525,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
