"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm aiming to stay within a tighter budget. Given my valuation and the product's potential, I'm willing to offer $950,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $950,000 is certainly a respectable sum, I believe the true value of this product, especially given the benefits it will bring you, is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This allows for a more balanced agreement while still reflecting the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. While I acknowledge its benefits,  $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part. I'm confident this price allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
