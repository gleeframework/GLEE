"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a valuable product for a price well below its true worth. I understand this product is worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a reduced price. Consider this offer carefully, as I have a backup buyer willing to pay full price.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
