"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. This reflects the maximum value I see in the product for my current needs.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to go up to $1,000,000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually acceptable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit more. Let's settle at $1,300,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,150,000?  I believe this represents a fair price considering our negotiations.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has steadily increased his offer. Accepting $1,150,000 is a significant profit, and it's better to secure a deal now than risk the negotiations falling apart later."
