"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product.  It's truly one-of-a-kind and I know it has the potential to be hugely beneficial for you.  Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. This reflects the maximum value I see in the product for my current needs.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.  How about we meet halfway at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to go up to $1,000,000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually acceptable price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit more. Let's settle at $1,300,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,150,000?  I believe this represents a fair price considering our negotiations.  Let's close this deal!",1150000.0,Bob,6,
