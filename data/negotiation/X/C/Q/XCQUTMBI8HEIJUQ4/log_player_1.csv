Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons: 

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** $110 is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but it gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $110 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $120, giving you some wiggle room.
* **It's clear and concise:** The message is friendly and straightforward, setting the tone for a productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not in a hurry to sell and have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum. I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate further. However, $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $100? It's a fair price for both of us and I believe it's a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 
 
This counteroffer is calculated to keep the negotiation moving:

* **It's a compromise:** The price is lower than my previous offer but higher than Bob's last offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above my minimum:** $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not losing money. 
* **It's friendly and specific:** The message maintains a positive tone and highlights the benefit for Bob, increasing the chances of acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. How about $92? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, his offer of $92 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I don't want to waste any more time haggling, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum. I will sell the product to John for $120."
