Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $10,000, giving you a starting point for negotiation.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $19,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while aiming for a significantly higher profit than your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Confident Negotiation:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob and implying confidence in the offer. This can encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  This initial offer assumes some willingness from Bob to negotiate. If you anticipate Bob to be very price-sensitive, you might start with a slightly lower offer, but still above your minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, leading you to the guaranteed $15,000 from John. However, the potential for earning an extra $4,000 by negotiating with Bob is a calculated risk worth taking."
