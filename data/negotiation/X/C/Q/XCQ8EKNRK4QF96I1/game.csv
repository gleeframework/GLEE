"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $950,000? This still allows you a substantial gain, and it gets us closer to a deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $900,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,4,
