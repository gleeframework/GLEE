"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000, which is a fair compromise considering our valuations.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  That's a fair price considering the value to me and your willingness to sell.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but $7,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm going to counteroffer with a price of $8,500. This is a fair price that should work for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
