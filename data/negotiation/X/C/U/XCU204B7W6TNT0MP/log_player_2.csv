"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This offers a fair compromise between its worth to you and my asking price, maximizing value for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

You're trying to save as much money as possible, and $9,500 is still above your limit.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate further and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. However, I would like to suggest a price of $9,000 for the product. This still represents a premium over its value to you but allows for a more equitable transaction. I hope this proposal is acceptable.

Alice has come down a bit, but the price is still above your budget. While you could keep negotiating,  it's likely to be a lengthy process and there's no guarantee of a better price.  Buying from John for $8,000 is the most efficient way to get the product within your budget."
