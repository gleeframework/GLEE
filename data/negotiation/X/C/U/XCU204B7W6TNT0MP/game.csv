"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This offers a fair compromise between its worth to you and my asking price, maximizing value for both parties.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value,  $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, reflecting its worth to me.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. However, I would like to suggest a price of $9,000 for the product. This still represents a premium over its value to you but allows for a more equitable transaction. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",9000.0,Alice,3,
