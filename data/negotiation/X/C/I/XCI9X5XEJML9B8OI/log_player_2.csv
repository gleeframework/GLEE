"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for $8,000 from John.  While $10,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price of $12,000, it's still above your maximum budget. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

You're aiming for a price closer to your maximum budget of $8,000.  Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's still above Alice's minimum selling price but gives her some room to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. You've already established that you can get the product for $8,000 from John. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice, as you're unlikely to get a better deal. It's time to secure the product from John."
