"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $15,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $13,000? It's a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $13,000 is cutting it close to my bottom line.  How about we split the difference again and call it $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000.  If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to explore other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,
