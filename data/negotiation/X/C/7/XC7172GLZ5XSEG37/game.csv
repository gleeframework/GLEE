"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot of time and resources into this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for it. Can we discuss further?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is firm at $950,000. If we can find common ground there, I'm ready to move forward. ",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $950,000, so I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm able to go. I'm happy to meet you in the middle between our last two offers, which would bring the price to $975,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
