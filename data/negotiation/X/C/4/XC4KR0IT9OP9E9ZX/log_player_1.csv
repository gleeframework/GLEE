Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at the price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 925000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) as possible. 
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing John will buy it for $800,000 provides a safety net. The offer to Bob needs to be significantly more attractive than this.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob to be very price-sensitive, you might slightly lower the initial offer.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a fairer price might be more strategic in the long run."
