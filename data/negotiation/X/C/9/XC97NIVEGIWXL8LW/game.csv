"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me. Considering the value the product brings to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much.
