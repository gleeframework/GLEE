Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,000. How about $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $10,500.  Since you can get the product for $10,000 from John, it's time to cut your losses and buy from him."
