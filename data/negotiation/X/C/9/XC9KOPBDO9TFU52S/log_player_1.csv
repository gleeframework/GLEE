Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can start the negotiation significantly higher. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Offering a price of $2,250,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down while still potentially securing a price significantly higher than our minimum.
* **Confident framing:** The language used in the message emphasizes the product's value and frames the price as a starting point for discussion, not a final offer. This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, Alice maximizes her chances of securing the best possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
