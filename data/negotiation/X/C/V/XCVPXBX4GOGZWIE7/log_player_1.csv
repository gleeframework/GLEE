{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. I'm also trying to be friendly and positive in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Could we negotiate the price down to $95? I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to counteroffer Bob to try and get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $92.50 for the product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $92.50 is still below my minimum.  While I could try to counteroffer again, it's likely we'll just go back and forth. I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement that benefits me enough.  Instead, I'll take the guaranteed $100 from John."
