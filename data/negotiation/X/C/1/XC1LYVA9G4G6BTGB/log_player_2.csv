"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's initial offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows interest:** Acknowledging Alice's offer keeps the negotiation positive.
* **Provides a reason:**  Simply saying ""too high"" can be off-putting. Giving a reason, even a simple one, makes your position more understandable.
* **Offers a significant but not unreasonable decrease:**  Aiming for a price closer to your target while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit away from a price I'm fully comfortable with.  It's worth another counteroffer before resorting to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

Here's the strategy:

* **Continuing positive tone:**  Maintaining a good rapport with Alice is important for a successful negotiation.
* **Slight concession:** Moving a bit closer to Alice's price shows willingness to compromise.
* **Holding firm:**  The offer still keeps us within a reasonable range of our target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal, Bob. I can do $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's the lowest price I can sell it for and still make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met her bottom line. While we could try to push further, it's unlikely she'll go lower, and we'd risk losing the deal. Accepting $10,000 gets us the product at a great price."
