"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm looking for a price around $11,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction, starting with a counteroffer that's $1,500 lower than Alice's initial offer.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $9,500 is still within Bob's budget, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but also holding firm on his desired price point.
* **Open to discussion:** The message keeps the door open for further negotiation, signaling that Bob is open to reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but  $9,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $10,250 is a better deal than $11,000, it's still above his desired price point. He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a little too high for me. How about we settle on $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** Bob is making a smaller counteroffer this time, showing he's getting closer to Alice's price but still maintaining a desire to save.
* **Appealing to fairness:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair"" price for both parties, making the offer more appealing and less likely to be rejected outright.
* **Focus on closing the deal:**  The message explicitly expresses a desire to reach an agreement, creating a sense of urgency and potentially pushing Alice towards a deal."
