Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is strategically priced:

* **Above Bob's valuation:** It's high enough for me to make a profit compared to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Below John's offer:** It's low enough that Bob might be tempted to accept, especially if he values the product close to $10,000.

This gives Bob a reason to consider the offer and me a chance to maximize my earnings."
