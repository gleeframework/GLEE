This is the best option for the following reasons:

* **Matches your budget:** Alice's offer of $800,000 meets your maximum price limit.
* **Avoids John:**  While you could buy from John for the same price, accepting Alice's offer saves you the potential hassle of switching sellers. 
* **Limited time:** With only a few rounds left, there's no guarantee you can negotiate a lower price with Alice. 

Accepting this offer ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids further negotiation risks."
