"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the best price I can do, but I think it's a great deal for you too!",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I can justify right now. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $11,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price for this product. I can offer it to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
