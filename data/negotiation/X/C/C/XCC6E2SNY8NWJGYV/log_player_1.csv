I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $800000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm prepared to offer $900000, which I believe is a fair starting point for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $900,000 just yet.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
