"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my maximum price of $1,200,000 and leaves room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $800,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which I believe is a fair starting point for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $900000 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm confident this is a reasonable starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is higher than her initial offer, it's still below my desired price. I want to see if I can get closer to my target of $900,000. By rejecting this offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in it."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $875000 just yet. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $860000. This is a slight concession, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $860,000 is getting closer to my target price of $900,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer, I'm only 5 rounds into the negotiation. Accepting this offer secures a good price and prevents the risk of Alice backing out or the negotiation dragging on further. It's also significantly lower than my backup option with John at $1,200,000."
