"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $800000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm prepared to offer $900000, which I believe is a fair starting point for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $900000 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm confident this is a reasonable starting point.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $875000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in it.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $875000 just yet. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $860000. This is a slight concession, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",860000.0,Alice,5,
