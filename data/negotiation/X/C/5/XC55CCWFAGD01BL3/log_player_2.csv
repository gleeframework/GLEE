**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Even though Alice's offer is above the product's value to her ($1,200,000), it's still lower than what you'd pay John ($1,500,000).
* **You save money by accepting Alice's offer.** You'll be paying $200,000 less than if you bought from John."
