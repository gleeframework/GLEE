I'm starting high, aiming for a big profit. This price is significantly above my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. I'll see if Bob is interested in this offer. If not, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."

While $700,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum value.  I believe there's more room for negotiation.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
