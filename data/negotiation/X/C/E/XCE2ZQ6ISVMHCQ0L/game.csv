"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,600,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,350,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
