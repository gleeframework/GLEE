"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to us both. This unique item is worth $1,200,000 to you, and I believe it could significantly enhance your life or business. Considering its true worth and the potential it offers, I am extending an exclusive offer to purchase this product from me at a special price of $1,150,000. This is an exceptional deal, designed to ensure that we both benefit from this transaction. I look forward to discussing the details with you and hope to facilitate a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While she claims it's worth $1,200,000 to you, you have a backup option for that price. By rejecting her offer, you signal that her initial price is too high. She might come back with a better offer, and even if she doesn't, you're not losing anything by checking with John."
