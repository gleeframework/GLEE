"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my minimum asking price and a great value for you.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for your product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000?  It's still a significant saving for you and gets us closer to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $1,025,000 for your product. This brings us closer to my budget while still providing a good value for you.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up.  $1,025,000 is getting closer, but I'm still just a bit below my desired price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,037,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good value for you.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
