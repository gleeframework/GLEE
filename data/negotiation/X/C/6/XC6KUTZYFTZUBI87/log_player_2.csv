"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Since the product is worth $8,000 to you, and you can buy it from John for $8,000, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. You can get the same product for the same price from John."
