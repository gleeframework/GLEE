"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $100 for the product.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I think the product is worth more than $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? ",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $130. I'm willing to give you a small concession and offer it to you for $127.50. What do you think?",127.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $127.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $118.75.  This feels like a fair price considering our back and forth.  What do you think?",118.75,Bob,6,
