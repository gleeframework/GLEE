"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price.  Let's say $10,000?  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer:**  Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is less than John's price of $12,000. 
* **You are willing to pay up to $12,000:**  Even though Alice's offer is above your ideal price point, it's still within your budget. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob to save money while still getting the product."
