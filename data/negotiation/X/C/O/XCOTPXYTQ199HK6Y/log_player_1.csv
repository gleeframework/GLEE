Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $14,500 is higher than Bob's $12,000 value, but it leaves some room for negotiation.
* **It's significantly less than your minimum:**  Offering $14,500 gives you a buffer in case Bob counteroffers.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** This price demonstrates that you're open to compromise, increasing the chances of a successful deal. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise, but closer to my desired price point. It's likely to be more appealing to Bob, as it's a smaller step up from his offer. Let's see if we can reach a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's latest offer of $13,200 is still below my minimum price of $15,000. Since John is willing to pay my desired price, I'm going to sell the product to him and avoid further negotiations."
