**Reasoning:**

While I could continue pushing Alice closer to $700,000, her messages indicate she is firming up her price.  There's a real risk she won't go much lower. At $715,000, I'm still getting a significant discount from her initial offer and importantly, it's less than John's $800,000 backup.  It's better to secure the deal now at a good price than risk it going sideways."
