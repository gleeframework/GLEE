**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  While you could buy from John for $1,000,000, Alice's offer of $950,000 saves you $50,000. 
* **Your goal is to save money.** The prompt states your goal is to ""save as much money as you can"". 
* **Even though Alice values the product higher, it's not relevant.**  The prompt focuses on your perspective and your maximum value. You're not trying to maximize value for Alice."
