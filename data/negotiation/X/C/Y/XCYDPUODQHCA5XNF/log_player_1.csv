Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully earn a profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500, which is still a bit above Bob's initial counter-offer, but closer to what I want. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product and don't want to sell it too cheaply."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to get closer to $10,000, there's a chance he'll walk away if I counter-offer again.  It's better to secure the $9,800 sale and avoid the risk of losing him completely."
