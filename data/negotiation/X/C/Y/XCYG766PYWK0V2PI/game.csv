"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I could meet you halfway between our offers. Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to offer $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's find a way to make this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
