Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting stubborn. While $96 is a bit closer to my ideal price, it's still not ideal. With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking a deal falling apart.  It's better to go with the guaranteed price of $80 from John and avoid further negotiation."
