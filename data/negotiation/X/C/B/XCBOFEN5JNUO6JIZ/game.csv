"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This product truly is worth the investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",11500.0,Bob,4,
