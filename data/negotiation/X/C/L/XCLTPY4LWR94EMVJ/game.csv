"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,500,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I appreciate your offer, but I was really hoping to get closer to the value I believe this product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and what I'm willing to pay.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,100,000. However, I still believe the product's value is worth a bit more than that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is a $100,000 increment from your last offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
