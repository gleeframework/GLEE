Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing his valuation is higher than John's.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still ensuring Alice gets significantly more than John's offer.
* **Balance Confidence and Reasonableness:** The message aims to convey the product's value while justifying the high price.  It invites Bob to engage in a discussion rather than presenting a take-it-or-leave-it offer. 
 
**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy balances that risk with the potential for a significantly higher profit than accepting John's guaranteed offer."
