Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get the highest price possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $100 (John), I can aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This offer will help me understand how interested Bob is in the product. If he accepts, great! If he negotiates, we can find a mutually agreeable price. If he rejects outright, I haven't lost anything because I have John as a backup."
