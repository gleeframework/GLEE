"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  It also demonstrates that you're confident in the product's worth while leaving space for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate and the option to sell to John for a much higher price. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a good offer, it's still below what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a more reasonable price for me. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm only in round 4, which means I have 6 more rounds to try and get closer to my target price. There's still time to see if I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable compromise. I'm confident you'll find this a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,800 is a more reasonable price for me. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm only in round 6, which means I have 4 more rounds to try and get closer to my target price. I'm still confident I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I value your continued interest,  $9,800 is still not a price that works for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,200, but I won't go any lower. This is a fair compromise given the product's value. Let's close this deal, it's a win-win for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a fair price for me. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are in round 8, and while Bob is consistently offering prices closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, they are still significantly lower. I have only 2 rounds left. If I reject Bob's offer, there is a high risk that he will not make a counteroffer that reaches my price point. Therefore, it is more beneficial to sell the product to John for $15,000, ensuring a higher profit than a potential deal with Bob that is still significantly lower than my ideal price."
