Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price of $1,300,000 sets a strong anchor, closer to your minimum acceptable price. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're starting from a strong position.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though you know Bob values it less. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""initially proposing"" and ""let me know your thoughts""  signals  willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

**Important:** It's crucial to balance pushing for a high price with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If Bob rejects, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum."
