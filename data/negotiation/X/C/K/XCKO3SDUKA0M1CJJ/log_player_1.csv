Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider that?

Bob's offer is below my minimum price, but it's still a good starting point for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $150. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm getting close to my minimum price, but Bob's offers are still below $150.  I'm not sure if I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds.  It's better to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $150."
