Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the value, the message hints at the product's worth by mentioning a ""value"" and offering a ""chance"" before a public listing.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** The message ends with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects the price, you have the security of John's offer at $12,000."
