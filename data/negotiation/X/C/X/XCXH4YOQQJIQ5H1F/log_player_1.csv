Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it. This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
