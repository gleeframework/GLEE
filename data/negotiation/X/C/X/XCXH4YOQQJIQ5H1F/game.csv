"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $9,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it. This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $8,750. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being reasonable for me.",8750.0,Alice,3,
