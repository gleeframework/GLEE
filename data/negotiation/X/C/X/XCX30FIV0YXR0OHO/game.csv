"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you trying to work with me, but $120 is a little higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about we split the difference and go with $100? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $105. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in it.",105.0,Alice,5,
