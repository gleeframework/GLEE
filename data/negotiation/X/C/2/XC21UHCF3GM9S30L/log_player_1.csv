"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire it."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, his counteroffers are likely to be closer to your desired range.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The large gap between the initial price and your minimum ($1,200,000) provides ample space for negotiation over the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, it's too early to settle. We have eight more rounds to potentially negotiate a better deal.  We'll aim to bring him up from this starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product to me is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** We're making a significant concession from our initial offer to show flexibility, but we're still holding firm well above Bob's offer. This signals that we're serious but willing to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:**  By reiterating the product's value, we aim to re-anchor Bob's perception to a higher price point.
* **Strategic Positioning:** We're aiming to move the negotiation closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're attached to the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offers, indicating his interest in the product. We are still in a good position to negotiate a higher price. We'll continue the process with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to consider $1,500,000. I believe this reflects a fair price given its unique value."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer splits the difference between our last offer ($1,600,000) and his last counteroffer ($1,400,000), demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming high.
* **Maintaining Value Assertion:** We continue to subtly reinforce the product's value without being overly aggressive in our language.
* **Urgency and Compromise:**  By suggesting we ""find a compromise,"" we subtly introduce a sense of urgency to push the negotiation towards a close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at $1,400,000, but his willingness to negotiate is a positive sign. We still have time to push for a better price, and his repeated offers suggest he's keen on the product.  We'll make a small concession to keep the momentum going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about acquiring this product, and I respect that.  How about we meet at $1,450,000?  That's a significant price reduction on my end, and reflects my desire to close this deal."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession, High Pressure:**  We're making a relatively small concession ($50,000), signaling that we're nearing our bottom line. 
* **Closing Language:** By emphasizing our desire to ""close the deal"" and highlighting our ""significant price reduction,"" we're creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Midpoint Compromise:** This offer sits directly in the middle of the previous two offers, demonstrating fairness while still pushing for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:** We are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. While we could likely push for a bit more, the time pressure increases the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Reasonable Profit:** $1,350,000 is a significant profit above our minimum ($1,200,000) and a good return on the product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The difference between Bob's current offer and potentially squeezing out a bit more is outweighed by the risk of him accepting a deal elsewhere or significantly lowering his offer in later rounds."
