"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  This is a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you.  I'm confident we can find a price we're both happy with.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,100,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I'd like to negotiate further to find a price we're both comfortable with.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still gives you a great value for a product worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $980,000. This price is closer to what I'm comfortable with, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. I'm still very interested in purchasing the product from you.",980000.0,Bob,4,
