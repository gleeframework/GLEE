"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no reason to accept an offer higher than that. You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering Alice $95. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's below my maximum price and gives Alice some room to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still above my maximum price. I will reject the offer and attempt to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $98. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $102 is closer to my maximum price, I'm still going to reject Alice's offer. With five rounds remaining, I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 99}
```

I'm raising my offer to $99. This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping Alice will accept it considering the limited time remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Alice's offer. With only three rounds left, the chances of negotiating a lower price are diminishing. At $101, the price is only slightly above what I can get from John, so it's a reasonable compromise."
