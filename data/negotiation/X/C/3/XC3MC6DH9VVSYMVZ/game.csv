"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me given the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and ensures a fair return for me while still being a great deal for you. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
