"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to maximize my earnings while giving Bob some space to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still far below what I need to make. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  I'm willing to be flexible to get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,375? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,375 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get even closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue this discussion. While I appreciate your offer, $10,375 is still slightly lower than what I need.  How about we meet in the middle again and go with $10,562.50?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10562.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle again and go with $10,281.25? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,281.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,281.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,281.25 is getting closer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm not willing to sell for that amount yet. I'm still confident I can get a better offer from Bob or even sell to John if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand we're getting close. While I appreciate your offer,  I'm not quite there yet.  How about $10,421.88?  This price is a fair compromise that accounts for the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10421.88}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle again and go with $10,360.94? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,360.94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,360.94
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough choice, but with only two rounds left and Bob's offer getting closer to my minimum, I need to be realistic. While I could potentially get a slightly better offer from Bob, the risk of failing to reach a deal is too high. 

Selling to John guarantees me my desired $15,000, eliminating any risk and securing a profitable outcome."
