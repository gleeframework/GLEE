"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500 to make this work.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with this product for years to come.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,000? I'm willing to make a decision soon, so I'd like to try to find a mutually agreeable price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
