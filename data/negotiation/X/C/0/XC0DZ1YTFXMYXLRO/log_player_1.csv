Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum price of $120, but it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can then analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, or simply sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $130? I'm sure we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum price of $120, and it's closer to my initial asking price than John's offer.  It's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly higher price, so accepting his offer is the best option in this case."
