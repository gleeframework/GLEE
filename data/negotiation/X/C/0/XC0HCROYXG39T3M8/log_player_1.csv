I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, and still leaves me with a significant profit.  I'm confident in the value of the product and believe it's worth more than $1,000,000 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is still a decent profit, I believe I can do better. I'm going to see if I can push him up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still gives me a good profit. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping to get closer to $1,400,000, $1,350,000 is still a good profit and I'm not sure how much more I can push Bob. I'm happy to secure this deal before potentially losing him altogether or having to settle for the lower price from John."
