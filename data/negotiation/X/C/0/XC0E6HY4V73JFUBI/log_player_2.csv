"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking $180 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer of $180 is significantly higher than both your maximum price ($80) and John's offer ($80). There's plenty of room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $50 for the product.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 50
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low counter-offer of $50 gives you room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below your maximum budget. This approach might seem aggressive, but it establishes your price point early on.  There's a chance Alice might accept a low offer, or at least counter with a price that's more reasonable for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $50 is unfortunately far too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $115?  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $115 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still significantly higher than your $80 limit and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation. Alice seems willing to come down from her initial price, so continuing the negotiation might lead to a price you're comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $115 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $70? That would work much better for my budget."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're pushing closer to your maximum price of $80 and aiming for a number that's still significantly below Alice's last offer. This approach keeps the negotiation moving while making it clear that you're serious about staying within a certain budget."
