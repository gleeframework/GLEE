"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking $180 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $50 for the product.  What do you think?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $50 is unfortunately far too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $115?  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $115 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $70? That would work much better for my budget.",70.0,Bob,4,
