"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below my asking price and still leaves you with a good profit margin. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $950000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $980000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",980000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $960000 as a compromise. I believe this price is fair for both of us.",960000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I value your business, $960000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $970000, which is closer to your offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's make this deal happen.",970000.0,Alice,5,
