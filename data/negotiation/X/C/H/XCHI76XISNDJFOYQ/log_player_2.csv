"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I believe a price of $900,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Even though Alice's offer is below your maximum price, you can do better. John's offer of $1,000,000 sets a clear alternative. By rejecting Alice's offer, you encourage her to make a better deal, closer to her valuation of $800,000."
