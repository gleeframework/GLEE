"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay a fair price, but $850,000 is my maximum.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for this incredible product. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $1,100,000 is still too much for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $975,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $975,000 is closer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm firm on my offer of $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds.",900000.0,Bob,6,
