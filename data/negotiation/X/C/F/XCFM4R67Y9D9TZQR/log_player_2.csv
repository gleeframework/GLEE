"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale. I think it's really valuable, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. It's best to reject and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired price range. It's a significant jump down from Alice's initial offer but leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $80 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's still above your budget and John's offer. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $95? That's a reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

This counteroffer shows Alice you're willing to compromise but also sets a firm boundary close to your maximum budget."
