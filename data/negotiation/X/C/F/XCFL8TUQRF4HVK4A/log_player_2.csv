"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to me. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement. I am offering you the chance to purchase this unique item for $1,400,000. This price reflects the intrinsic worth and the potential it holds for you, while also ensuring a fair return on my investment. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your interests and budget. I look forward to discussing the details further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still more than what John is offering. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can leverage John's lower price and save $200,000 ($1,400,000 - $1,200,000)."
