Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you see the value in.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still ensuring a successful sale:

* **Understanding Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving us room to negotiate above our minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $1,400,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 provides a safety net. This means we don't have to go below that price with Bob.

By starting high but within a reasonable range, we increase the chances of securing a deal close to the maximum profit possible."
