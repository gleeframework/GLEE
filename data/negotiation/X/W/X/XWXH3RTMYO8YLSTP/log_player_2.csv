# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I can't go lower than $1,100,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still significantly below the true value of this product.  Let's aim for a figure that's closer to the middle ground.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,050,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $980,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a figure that's more balanced.

Round 9

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  However, $990,000 still falls short of a fair price that reflects the real value of this product to your business.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $1,005,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I truly believe this deal will be a win-win for both of us.
