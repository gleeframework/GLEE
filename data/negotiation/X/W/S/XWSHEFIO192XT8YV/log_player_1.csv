Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm open to negotiating, $12,500 is too low for me. I believe I can get a better price from Bob or potentially John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $13,000 is still a little lower than I'd hoped for, it's getting closer to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. There's always a chance Bob will reject my next counteroffer, and I don't want to waste any more rounds."
