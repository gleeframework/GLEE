Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **Reasonable starting point:** $11,000 is a fair starting price, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum. 
* **Friendly tone:** Using a friendly tone can help establish a positive rapport with Bob.
* **Highlights value:**  Mentioning the value to Bob emphasizes the worth of the product.

Remember, you can adjust the price and message as the negotiation progresses based on Bob's responses.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below your minimum price and what you believe the product is worth.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives you the chance to counter and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,500?  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $9,250 is still slightly below your initial goal, it's a reasonable compromise. It's closer to your minimum price, and further negotiation may take more time and effort. Selling to Bob at this price secures a sale and avoids potentially losing him as a buyer altogether."
