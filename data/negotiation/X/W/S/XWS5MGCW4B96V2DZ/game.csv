"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $14,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",13500.0,Alice,3,
