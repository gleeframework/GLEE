"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering me. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm happy to buy it for $12,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $16,000. Would you be willing to come down to $14,000?  This is my final offer.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $15,500. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
