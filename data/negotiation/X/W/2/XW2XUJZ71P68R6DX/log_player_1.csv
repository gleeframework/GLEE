"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium, knowing the product is worth $12,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for anything less than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than what he's willing to pay. However, it also gives me a bit more profit than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but if not, we'll continue to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price. I'm running out of time, but I'm not giving up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping it's enough to entice Bob to finally accept the offer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm starting to feel the time crunch. If he rejects this offer, I'll be forced to make a difficult decision in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum acceptable price. With only 4 rounds left, I can't risk holding out for a higher price. I'm accepting his offer and selling the product to Bob for $12,000."
