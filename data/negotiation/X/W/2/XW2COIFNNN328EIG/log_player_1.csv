```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to maximize profit. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, she should aim for a price slightly below that to entice Bob.
* **High but Believable:**  Offering a price just below John's offer creates a sense of urgency and value. Bob might be more inclined to buy at $11,999, thinking he's getting a deal compared to the potential alternative buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is already aggressive, it leaves a tiny window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly set on the product."
