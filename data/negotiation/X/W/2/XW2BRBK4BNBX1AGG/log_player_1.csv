Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering a price too close to $12,000 might discourage Bob. By starting at $11,500, Alice increases the likelihood of a successful sale. 
* **Backup Option:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
