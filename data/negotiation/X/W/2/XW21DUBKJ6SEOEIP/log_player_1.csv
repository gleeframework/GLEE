Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable paying $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

While I could push for more, accepting $13,500 is a solid gain over my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
