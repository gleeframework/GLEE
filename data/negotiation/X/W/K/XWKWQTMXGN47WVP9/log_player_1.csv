Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $120."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for no less than $80.
* **John's Offer:** John acts as a safety net, ensuring you can sell the product for $80 if Bob refuses.

By offering the product at $120, you aim for a price that is:

* **Attractive to Bob:**  Significantly below his perceived value.
* **Profitable for You:**  Well above your minimum selling price and John's offer.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while keeping the offer enticing for Bob."
