"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice is willing to come down, and you might be able to get a better deal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping that this will encourage Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget.  Since John also offers the product for $1,000,000, there's no advantage to continuing the negotiation. Accepting Alice's offer allows me to acquire the product at the best possible price."
