"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This would still be a good profit for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000. It's getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still not quite there, but $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000, but that's my final offer. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're able to accept this, or if you need to consider other options.",925000.0,Alice,5,
