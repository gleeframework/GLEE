"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to let it go for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what I think Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to remember I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm open to negotiation, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about $160? I think it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

I'm sticking to my initial strategy of starting high and gradually lowering the price.  $160 is still above what Bob is willing to pay, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and  keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think $160 is a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $140 is still a little too low. I'm going to counter with a price that's just slightly below John's offer, hoping to entice Bob to accept and avoid having to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to come down a bit more to $145.  This is a really good price for this product, and I think we're close to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

I'm hoping that by offering $145, I'll be able to close the deal with Bob. It's just above my minimum acceptable price, and it's a good compromise that acknowledges Bob's offer. It also keeps the pressure on him to accept, as he's only $5 away from a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? I really think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of time.  It's best to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150.  I'll be able to recoup my minimum, and I can avoid the risk of further negotiation that might lead to an even lower price."
