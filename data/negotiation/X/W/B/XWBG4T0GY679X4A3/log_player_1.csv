Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's her guaranteed profit with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below her absolute minimum allows room for Bob to counter-offer. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay slightly more than his initial valuation of $80. 
* **Avoid Scaring Bob Away:**  Offering it at $120 right away might seem too high and discourage Bob from even considering it.

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring a sale is made."
