"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking maybe we could meet at $1550000 instead? That's still a great price for this product, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1550000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1580000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1580000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1580000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make one final offer of $1500000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
