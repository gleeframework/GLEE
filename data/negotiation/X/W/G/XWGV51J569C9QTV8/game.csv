"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $900,000, which is a $200,000 reduction from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite there yet. I can offer you a slight discount from $900,000 to $820,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. Let's see if we can make a deal.",820000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $780,000, Bob. I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount from $820,000 to $810,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal today.",810000.0,Alice,7,
