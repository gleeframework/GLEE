Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of this product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1500000 might be a bit too high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1350000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down a bit, but $1350000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $1250000, which is closer to my budget and a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
