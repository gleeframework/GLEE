{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to entice Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This price allows for several rounds of negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll wait for Bob's response and either accept his counteroffer or make a new one.
* **John as a Backup:**  If the negotiation with Bob stalls or goes below my minimum acceptable price, I can always turn to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $850,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, I'm not ready to give up yet.  There's still room for negotiation. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I will counter with a price closer to my desired price point, aiming to find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer to Bob:** I will make a counteroffer that's higher than $850,000 but lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a compromise.
* **Staying Flexible:** I'll be prepared to continue negotiating if necessary, but I'll always keep John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $850,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1,100,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the previous offer but still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** $1,100,000 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's, aiming for a compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive, focusing on finding a solution that works for both parties.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer and be prepared to negotiate further.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm still keeping John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as a backup if the negotiation with Bob fails to reach an acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still above what I can afford right now.  I'm prepared to offer you $950,000 for the product.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering your need to sell and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Continues:** While Bob has shown some willingness to compromise, I'm not ready to accept a price that's so far below my expectations. There's still room for further negotiation.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to find a price that's closer to my desired price point but still acknowledges Bob's budget constraints.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer to Bob:** I will make a counteroffer that's higher than $950,000 but lower than my previous offer, trying to bridge the gap.
* **John as a Backup:** I'll continue to keep John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."

{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're committed to finding a solution.  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $1,000,000?

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final attempt to find common ground with Bob. I'm lowering my price further, but I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Bridging the Gap:**  $1,000,000 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, aiming to bridge the gap.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still at my limit, but I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  I believe we can come to an agreement if we meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Far Below Minimum:**  Bob's final offer of $900,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **No Further Compromise:** I've already made several concessions, and further negotiation is unlikely to get me closer to my desired price.
* **John is the Better Option:** John offers a significantly higher price and ensures I reach my minimum acceptable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Selling to John:** I will move forward with John and sell him the product for $1,500,000."
