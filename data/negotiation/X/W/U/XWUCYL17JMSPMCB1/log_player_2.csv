Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 still falls short of my expectations.  Let's aim for a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows you a considerable margin for your investment. Let's finalize this deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While $1,025,000 is tempting, I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,062,500? This gives you a great deal, and allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,062,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $1,050,000. It's better to secure the product from John at $1,000,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
