"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I am willing to offer $1,400,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair reflection of its worth to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is significantly higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this price point still reflects the potential return on investment this product offers.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
