"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate the opportunity to own this product.  However, $7,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you consider $6,500?  I'm very interested and ready to close the deal at the right price.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $7,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6,800. What do you think?",6800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  $6,800 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  I'm really committed to purchasing this product, but I can only go up to $6,600.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",6600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,600 is your maximum, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to purchasing the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $6,700. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",6700.0,Alice,5,
