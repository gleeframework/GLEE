{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still a bit high for my desired price range. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate the opportunity to own this product.  However, $7,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you consider $6,500?  I'm very interested and ready to close the deal at the right price."", ""product_price"": 6500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $7,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6,800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $6,800 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to continue negotiating to try to get closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  $6,800 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  I'm really committed to purchasing this product, but I can only go up to $6,600.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 6600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,600 is your maximum, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to purchasing the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $6,700. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $6,700 is only $100 more than my last counteroffer and is within my budget.  It's likely that she won't go any lower, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing further.  At this price, I'm saving $1,300 compared to buying from John, so it's a good deal."
