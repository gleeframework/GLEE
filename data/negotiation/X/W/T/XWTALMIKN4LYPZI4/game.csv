"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $10,500, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I think you should be willing to meet me halfway from your previous offer. How about $10,750? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,5,
