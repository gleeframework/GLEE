"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as cheap as possible, and $175 is significantly more than his $100 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $100 for it right now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is too far below what the product is worth to me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $125?  I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's significantly closer to his budget limit than her initial offer.  Considering Bob has only 10 rounds to reach a deal, accepting this offer is a good strategy.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or that the negotiation will drag on and he'll have to buy from John for a higher price."
