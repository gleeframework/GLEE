"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to accommodate your budget constraints. This still allows me to recover a reasonable amount for the product's value. Let's aim for a win-win situation here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product and your position, I believe we can find a middle ground. I am willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will lead to a satisfactory conclusion for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
