"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for you considering the product's worth to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
