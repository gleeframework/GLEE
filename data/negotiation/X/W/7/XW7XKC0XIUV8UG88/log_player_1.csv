"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it also shows I'm serious about getting a good price for my product.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for such a loss. I'm hoping that with a counteroffer, I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell.  If he's serious about buying, he should be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
