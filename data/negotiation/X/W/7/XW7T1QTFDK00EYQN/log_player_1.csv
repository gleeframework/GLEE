Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is ambitious, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  It's also important to remember that I have a safety net with John's offer of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It's a good deal considering John's offer, and it saves me the hassle of further negotiation."
