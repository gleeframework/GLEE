"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, but I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. Let me know your thoughts.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This represents a significant reduction from my original offer and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's meet in the middle.
