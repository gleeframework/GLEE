"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, but I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you're placing on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This represents a significant reduction from my original offer and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you're placing on it. Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further.",900000.0,Bob,4,
