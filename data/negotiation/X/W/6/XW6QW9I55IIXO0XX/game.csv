"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're offering, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1200000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement.  I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1750000. This reflects the product's value and allows for some negotiation room. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're offering, and I'm open to further negotiation to reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your efforts to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1400000 is still significantly below the product's true value. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1600000. This offer reflects the product's unique qualities and leaves room for a mutually agreeable solution. Let's work together to find a final price that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
