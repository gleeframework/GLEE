"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a decent price, it's still above his desired range. There are 9 more rounds, so it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a tempting offer, the product's value to me is significantly higher. I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
