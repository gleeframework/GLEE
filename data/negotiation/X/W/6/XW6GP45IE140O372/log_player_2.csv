"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product, which I know holds significant value for your operations. My initial price is $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000, but Alice's offer is $950,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is an option, but not ideal.** It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which still represents a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a considerable discount from my initial offer and provides you with a substantial value.  I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your target price of $1,000,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You can likely get a lower price by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is still an option, but not ideal.**  You want to exhaust your negotiation options with Alice before resorting to John's higher price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and your need to sell. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going below $900,000. It's a significant price point for me, but it also allows for you to secure a very valuable product at a fair price. I'm confident that this price will ultimately be beneficial for both of us. Let's aim to find a solution that works for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is being stubborn.** She's refusing to budge from $900,000, and you're already at your limit for negotiation.
* **You're running out of time.** You've already had 5 rounds and only 5 rounds left. If you keep going back and forth, you might not have time to get a better offer from Alice.
* **John's offer is still a safety net.**  You can always buy from John for $1,000,000 if you don't reach a deal with Alice. 

**It's time to try and get Alice to move closer to your price.**  A counteroffer might not be successful, but it's worth a shot."
