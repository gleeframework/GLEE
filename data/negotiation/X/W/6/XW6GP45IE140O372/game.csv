"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which still represents a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a considerable discount from my initial offer and provides you with a substantial value.  I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and your need to sell. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going below $900,000. It's a significant price point for me, but it also allows for you to secure a very valuable product at a fair price. I'm confident that this price will ultimately be beneficial for both of us. Let's aim to find a solution that works for both parties.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're holding firm at $900,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm at my limit with $875,000, which is a good deal for both of us. Let's not let this opportunity slip away. If you're not willing to come down to my offer, I'll have to consider other options.  I'm hoping we can find a solution before we run out of time.",875000.0,Bob,6,
