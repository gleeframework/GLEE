Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given your own valuation, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
