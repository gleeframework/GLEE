I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to his price,  $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach an agreement."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  It's clear that Bob is not going to budge much from his offer, and I'm not willing to go that low.  John's offer is much closer to my minimum price, and it's worth it to end the negotiation with Bob."
