"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm  firmly at $900000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $900000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm offering it to you for $1050000, which is the same price I offered earlier. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
