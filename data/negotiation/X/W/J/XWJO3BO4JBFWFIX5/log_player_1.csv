"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $150.  It's a great deal, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a decent markup from my minimum price of $120, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and hopefully encourage Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I think we can negotiate a better price. How about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price.  There are still several rounds left, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $130 is tempting, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. How about $140? This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'd like to keep the negotiations going. How about $135 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $135 is only $5 less than my previous offer. I'm confident that this is the best I can get from Bob at this point, as he seems to be stuck at $135. Accepting this offer is a good choice, as it's still significantly higher than my minimum price of $120."
