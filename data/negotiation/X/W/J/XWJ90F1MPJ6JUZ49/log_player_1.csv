Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $100, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay slightly more. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  $125 is a price that allows for some negotiation room but still ensures a profit for Alice if Bob accepts. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has the security of John's offer at $150. This means she doesn't need to desperately sell to Bob for less than her minimum."
