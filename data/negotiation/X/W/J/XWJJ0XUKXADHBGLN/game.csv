"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, giving you a significant profit margin while still allowing me to recoup a large portion of my investment.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,000,000. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference and agree on $975,000. This price allows me to recover a significant portion of my investment while still providing you with a substantial profit.  Let's finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still believe that $975,000 is a bit out of my price range. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $960,000 for the product. I hope this offers a mutually beneficial solution.",960000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your financial limitations, and I'm willing to work with you to find a solution.  While $960,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm prepared to go down to $965,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part, but it also allows me to recover a substantial portion of my investment. Let's finalize this deal so we can both move forward.",965000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still not able to meet your price of $965,000. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a final price of $960,000 for the product. I hope this offer is within your acceptable range and allows us to conclude this transaction.",960000.0,Bob,6,
