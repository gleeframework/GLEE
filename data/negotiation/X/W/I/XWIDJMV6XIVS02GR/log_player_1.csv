"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get as close to the product's value as possible. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $90. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $87.50. That's the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price, and I think I can get a bit more with another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $89? That's a great price for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $89 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $88.50. That's the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal, I think Bob is being reasonable. At $88.5, I'm only $1.5 away from my minimum, and it's still a good profit.  It's not worth risking losing him altogether by rejecting his offer again."
