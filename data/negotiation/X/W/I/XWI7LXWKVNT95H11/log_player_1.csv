Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $120. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This initial high price will help gauge Bob's interest level and potential for counter-offering. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You have the security of John's offer ($100), so you're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $100. You have room to negotiate further, knowing you have John's offer as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a high-quality product that I'm sure you'll be happy with."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** You're signaling to Bob that you're not desperate to sell at any price.
* **Compromise (Slightly):** Moving down to $105 shows a willingness to negotiate but keeps you above your minimum. 
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value subtly reinforces why your price is justified. 

This offer puts the ball back in Bob's court. He'll need to decide if the product is worth more than $85 to him. You still have the safety net of selling to John for $100 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to go to $95, which is a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to your minimum, you're still in a position to negotiate. You're only $5 away from your goal, and there's no rush to accept. You'll try one more time to see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting close! I'm willing to come down to $100, my final offer. This is a steal for the value you're getting.  Let me know if we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is your ""final offer,"" you signal to Bob that you're serious and unlikely to go lower.
* **Meeting Your Minimum:** You're now offering the product at your absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **Urgency:**  Adding a touch of urgency (""Let me know if we have a deal"") might encourage Bob to make a decision.

This is a strong position to end on. If Bob accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects this offer, you're content walking away and taking John's $100 offer."
