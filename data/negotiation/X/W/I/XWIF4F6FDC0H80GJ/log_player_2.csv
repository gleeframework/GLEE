It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can potentially save $30 by rejecting the offer and counter-offering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get closer to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $130. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.

You're still closer to your goal of $100. Keep negotiating with Alice. There's still room for a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $135. This is the final price I'm willing to consider.

Alice is already at her final price. It's better to accept her offer and buy the product for $135, rather than risk losing the deal and having to buy from John for $150.  You've saved $15 compared to buying from John, which is a decent saving."
