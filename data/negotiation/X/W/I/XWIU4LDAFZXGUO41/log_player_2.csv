"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a better price than $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $10,000, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit as the product is worth $8,000 to her. This counteroffer is a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still a better deal than buying from John for $12,000. While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee he'll get a better price from Alice.  It's a good compromise to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
