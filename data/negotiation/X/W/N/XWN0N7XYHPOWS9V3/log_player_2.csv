"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's above your maximum budget of $800,000.  There's no point in accepting her offer.  Instead, you'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  This is my best price, and it reflects the maximum value I see in this opportunity."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you stretch to $1,700,000? I'm eager to find a price that works for us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget. While she's shown willingness to negotiate, she's not yet close to a price you're comfortable with.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept John's offer and secure the product for a price that fits within your financial constraints."
