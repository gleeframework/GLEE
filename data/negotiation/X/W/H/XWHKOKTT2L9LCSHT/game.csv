"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it.  This would still be a great deal for both of us, as it's well above your value for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $8,500. Given the value of the product to you and my costs, I am unable to accept a lower price than $9,000. I appreciate your interest and hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",9000.0,Alice,3,
