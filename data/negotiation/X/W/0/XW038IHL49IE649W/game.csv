"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the potential value in this product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my target price.  To start the negotiations, I'm offering $900,000. This reflects a fair starting point for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and the benefits it offers you.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm proposing $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 remains too high for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,000,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits we've both discussed.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your willingness to compromise is appreciated, and $1,000,000 is certainly getting closer. To find a solution that works for both of us, I propose $1,075,000.  This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budgetary considerations.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  To finalize this deal, I'm offering $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my financial constraints.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement with this offer.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
