Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming to secure the product for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  This would still allow you to make a healthy profit while giving me a better deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
