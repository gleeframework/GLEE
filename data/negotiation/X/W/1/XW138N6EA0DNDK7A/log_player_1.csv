Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm mentioning the product's value to Bob to emphasize its worth and justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm keeping the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Profit:** By starting high, I increase the possibility of achieving a higher selling price.
* **Avoid Immediate Deal with John:** I'm not rushing to sell to John at the lower price, allowing for the possibility of a better deal with Bob.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  Bob's response will give me insight into his willingness to negotiate and help me determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell. However, I am only able to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets within your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  While it's closer to my minimum than his initial rejection, I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.

**Strategy:**

* **Counter Offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my ideal selling price.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  This strategy allows me to maintain leverage in the negotiation and avoid settling for a price that's too low.

**Next Move:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, likely at a price slightly above his offer, leaving space for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go below $900,000.  This product holds significant value, and I believe this price reflects that. Would you be willing to consider a compromise?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language like ""compromise"" to encourage further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Gain Ground:** I'm slowly increasing the price while maintaining my leverage.
* **Test the Waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to move higher or if he's firm at $850,000.
* **Position for Success:** This counteroffer positions me to potentially reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to offer $875,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $75,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he might walk away entirely, leaving me with only the option to sell to John for $800,000.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take time and energy, potentially delaying the sale and impacting my overall profit.

**Strategy:**

* **Accept and Move On:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and relatively profitable sale.
* **Minimize Loss:**  While it's not my ideal price, accepting the offer minimizes the potential loss compared to selling to John.

**Conclusion:**

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision. It allows me to secure a decent profit without risking further negotiation or delaying the sale."
