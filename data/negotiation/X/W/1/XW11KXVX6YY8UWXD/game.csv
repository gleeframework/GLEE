"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $10,500 is still a bit much for my budget. Could we settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,750 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we try $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  How about $10,000 even? That's a nice round number we can both feel good about.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like the round number, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting a bit more. How about we try $10,100?",10100.0,Alice,7,
