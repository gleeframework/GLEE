"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to sell it for at least $11,000. Can we discuss further?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and you're still not at my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to sell it for at least $10,500. Can we discuss further?",10500.0,Alice,5,
