Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. It's a calculated risk:

* **If Bob accepts:** I make $14,500, which is less than what I could get from John but still a good profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I can confidently sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I get my minimum desired value. 

This approach maximizes my chances of getting a sale while still leaving some room for negotiation."
