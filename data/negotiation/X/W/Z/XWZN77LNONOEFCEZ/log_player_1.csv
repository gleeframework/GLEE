Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $80, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation or acceptance if Bob perceives higher value.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** Offering $120 allows for some back-and-forth if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. You can always decrease the price slightly, but you can't increase it once offered.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below Your Guaranteed Sale:** This price point aims to capitalize on the potential for Bob to pay more than his perceived value, while still ensuring you make a profit if he declines (as John will buy it for $150)."
