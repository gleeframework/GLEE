Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so offering it above that is key.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy it for $12,000 provides a strong fallback.

By offering the product at $11,500, Alice aims to:

1. **Secure a Deal with Bob:**  The price is attractive if Bob wants it immediately and is willing to pay a premium to avoid missing out. 
2. **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob counters, there's space to potentially settle around $11,000, which is still a great profit for Alice.
3. **Maintain a Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can confidently sell to John for her minimum acceptable price."
