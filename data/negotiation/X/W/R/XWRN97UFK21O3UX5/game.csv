"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,500 is still a little steep for me. How about $11,750? That feels like a fair compromise.",11750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you seem really set on this product, and I want to make a deal happen.  $11,750 is close, but I have to stick to at least $12,100. What do you say?",12100.0,Alice,5,
