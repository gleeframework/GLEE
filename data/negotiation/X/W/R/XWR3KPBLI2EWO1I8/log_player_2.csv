Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about this. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need to make a slight adjustment to cover some additional costs. How about we meet at $11,200?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly trying to push the price back up. Accepting at $11,200 secures a reasonable deal without risking the price going up further or running out of negotiation rounds."
