Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. What are your thoughts?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,160,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,165,000 is very close to my ideal price, and I'm comfortable paying that amount. It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for a lower price and potentially having Alice walk away.  I'm also aware that I can always buy from John for $1,200,000 if this deal falls through."
