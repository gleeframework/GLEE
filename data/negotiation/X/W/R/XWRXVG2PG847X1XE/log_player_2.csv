"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget. While $900,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. You should try to get an even better price by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. While it's closer to my counteroffer, there's still room for negotiation.  I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
