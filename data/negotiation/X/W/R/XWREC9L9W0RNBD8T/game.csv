"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,375,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,337,500. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. ",1337500.0,Bob,4,
