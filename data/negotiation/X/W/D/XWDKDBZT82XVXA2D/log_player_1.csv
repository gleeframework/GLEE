Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm still evaluating the product's value. Considering its worth to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's unique features and my budget.

Round 4

We're still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to counter and see if we can negotiate Bob a bit higher."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,750,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

While we could try to push for a bit more, Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we're now well above John's offer. Accepting at $1,750,000 secures a significant profit."
