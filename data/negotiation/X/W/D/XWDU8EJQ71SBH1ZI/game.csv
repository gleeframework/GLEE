"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $140 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll find this product very valuable. What do you say?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure about $135. I was thinking more like $125. I really need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at that price?,125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $128, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",128.0,Bob,6,
