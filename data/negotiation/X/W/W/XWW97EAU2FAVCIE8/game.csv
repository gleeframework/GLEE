"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget of $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down in price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $11000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that point.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11250. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
