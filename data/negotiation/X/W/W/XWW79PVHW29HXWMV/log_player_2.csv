"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's ambitious but within reason:**  While it's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, it's still a profitable price for her ($10 above her valuation). 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Alice rejects this offer, there's still space to negotiate upwards towards a price that works for both of us.
* **It shows I'm serious about buying:**  By offering a specific price, I'm demonstrating that I'm genuinely interested in the product and not just lowballing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can meet you in the middle at $127.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above my target. Let's see if we can negotiate a bit further before accepting or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $120? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **It's my target price:** $120 represents the maximum I'm willing to spend and allows me to maximize my savings.
* **It's potentially acceptable to Alice:**  While it's at her valuation, she might be willing to accept to avoid further negotiation or the risk of me going to John.
* **It conveys urgency:** By stating I'm ""ready to buy right now,"" I'm signaling that this is my final offer, encouraging Alice to make a decision."
