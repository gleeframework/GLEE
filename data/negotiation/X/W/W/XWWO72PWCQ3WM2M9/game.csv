"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit too high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $130? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $127? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm getting closer to my minimum price. Let me know what you think!",127.0,Alice,5,
