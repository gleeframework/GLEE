"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I'm going to need a lower price to make this work.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on $875,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, but I need to maintain a certain margin. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",925000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, which is just a slight increase from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",915000.0,Alice,7,
