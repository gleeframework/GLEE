"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair.  I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and anchors the price high in Bob's mind.
* **Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a number; I'm highlighting the ""immense value and potential"" to frame the product as highly desirable. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** I want to gauge Bob's initial reaction and willingness to negotiate.  This offer allows him to counter without feeling insulted.

This strategy aims for a strong opening position, leaving room to negotiate down while maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not convinced that $2,250,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering its worth to me is capped at $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still substantially below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point of a loss.  I believe there's room for Bob to move closer to my range, especially since we are only in round 2."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,750,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To move forward, I would need to see an offer closer to $2,000,000.  This price reflects its inherent value and potential for return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement (Slight):**  I've lowered my asking price by $250,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This reduction is substantial enough to keep Bob engaged but not so drastic that I appear desperate.
* **Holding Ground:** I'm still well above both Bob's offer and my minimum. I want to signal that I'm firm on the value of the product.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm again emphasizing the ""potential return on investment"" to keep Bob focused on the long-term benefits, rather than just his immediate perception of value. 

The goal is to find a balance between negotiation and firmly establishing the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's also a risk that Bob might walk away.  

Here's why accepting makes sense:

* **Profitable Deal:**  A $1,900,000 sale price represents a significant profit for me. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids further delays and uncertainty. The sooner I sell, the sooner I can reinvest the capital.
* **Negotiation Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob lowering his offer or even breaking off the deal entirely. 

This acceptance reflects a balance between maximizing profit and securing a favorable outcome with minimal risk at this stage of the negotiation."
