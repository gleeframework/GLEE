"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not convinced that $2,250,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering its worth to me is capped at $1,000,000.",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,750,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To move forward, I would need to see an offer closer to $2,000,000.  This price reflects its inherent value and potential for return on your investment.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
