{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts high but leaves room for negotiation.  It also acknowledges the value the product holds for Bob, making it more likely he'll engage in a conversation rather than immediately rejecting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below the product's value to Bob and leaves less room for negotiation. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm not able to go that low just yet.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,050,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $1025000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is a good compromise.  It's closer to my initial target, and it's more than I would get from John.  There's a chance he might reject my counteroffer, and then I'd have to settle for John's price. It's best to accept this offer and secure the sale."
