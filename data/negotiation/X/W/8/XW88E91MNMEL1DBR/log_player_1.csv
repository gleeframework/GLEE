Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is my initial offer to Bob. It's a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's still within a reasonable range for a product that I value highly.  I'm hoping this will entice Bob to seriously consider the purchase."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I believe I can get a higher price. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still above Bob's current offer.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable margin for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $50,000 higher than what I could get from John.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable offer that allows me to move forward with the sale.  It's not worth risking further negotiations and potentially losing the deal altogether."
