"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $100. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer.  There's a chance she'll come back with a lower price, and if not, you can always buy from John for $120."
