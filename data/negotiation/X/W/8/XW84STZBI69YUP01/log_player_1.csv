Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $100. I believe it would be highly valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum ($80).
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost."
