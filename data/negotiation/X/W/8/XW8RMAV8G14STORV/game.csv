"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to make a competitive offer, and I'd like to start with a price of $9,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to make a reasonable deal.  Let me know if you're open to that.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,5,
