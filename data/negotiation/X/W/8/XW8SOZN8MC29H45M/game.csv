,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway between $180 and $120. How about we try $150?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $140, which is closer to your original offer. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $135, which is closer to your original offer. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",130.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to pay $130, Bob, but I'm not sure if that's enough for me to consider selling. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $135 and $130. How about we try $132.50?",132.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts, Alice, but I'm afraid $132.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",130.0,Bob,10,
