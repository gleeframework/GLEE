"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is within your budget, it's still higher than what you'd pay to John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay John. It allows for some room for negotiation while still being a fair starting point considering Alice values the product at $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay John. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer was only slightly lower than her first offer, indicating she may be willing to budge a little further. My counteroffer is still significantly lower than Alice's initial asking price but is closer to her last offer, creating an opening for negotiation. It also allows for some room for a compromise if she still needs to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffers are getting progressively higher, which indicates she's not willing to budge significantly on her price. The current price is $1,300,000, which is much higher than what I can get from John. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice as the risk of a lower price is unlikely, and I could potentially lose out on a better deal."
