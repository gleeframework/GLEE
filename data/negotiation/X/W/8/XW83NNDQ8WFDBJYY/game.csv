"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested but $5,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's still a great deal for you and a fair price for me.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about $7,000? That's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, and I'm willing to compromise further.  How about $8,500? This is a significant investment for you, but it's also a fair price for the value I'm offering. Let's try to reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,5,
