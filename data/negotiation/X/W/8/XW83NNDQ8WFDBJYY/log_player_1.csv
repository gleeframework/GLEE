"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value Bob will gain by buying the product at this price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, which is important for maintaining a positive negotiation.

**Important Note:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000. This is my fallback option, so I'm not overly eager to accept a low price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $5,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's also significantly lower than the value of the product to me.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's initial rejection and counteroffer show he is interested in the product. This indicates there's room for negotiation and a potential for a higher price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000. While tempting, I'm hoping to get closer to that price through negotiation. 

**Next Step:** I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested but $5,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's still a great deal for you and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm still reminding Bob of the value he'll receive, reiterating that it's a great deal for him.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While moving towards Bob's offer, I'm staying above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm still open to further negotiations, but I'm setting a clear starting point for this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about $7,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. However,  the gap is narrowing, which is a good sign. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I believe I can still push for a higher price and get closer to my goal of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John now guarantees me $15,000, but I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can secure a price closer to that. 

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's current offer,  aiming to get closer to my desired price point while keeping the negotiation going."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, and I'm willing to compromise further.  How about $8,500? This is a significant investment for you, but it's also a fair price for the value I'm offering. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continued Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still pushing for a price that's closer to my desired range.
* **Highlighting the Value:** I'm reminding Bob that while the price may seem high, it's a good investment given the value he'll receive from the product.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the importance of reaching an agreement by saying ""Let's try to reach an agreement."" This subtly adds a sense of urgency and motivates Bob to consider my offer more seriously.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm still not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. This keeps the negotiation balanced."
