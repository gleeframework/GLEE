"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Since you're only willing to pay $1,200,000 and John is selling it for that price, it's the best option to buy from John and avoid any further negotiation with Alice."
