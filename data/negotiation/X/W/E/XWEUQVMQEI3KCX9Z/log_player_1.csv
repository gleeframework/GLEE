"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $950,000. It's a significant value proposition for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential worth to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This is still a good profit for you and allows me to make this a worthwhile purchase. Let's see if we can work out a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I have 10 rounds and can always sell to John for $800,000, so I'm willing to hold out for a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a substantial discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for you to make a strong profit. This is my final offer for this round. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's work together to find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal goal. I'm still within the first half of the negotiation rounds and have ample opportunity to continue bargaining. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him closer to $900,000. The fact that he's increasing his offer each round shows he's interested in making a deal, and I'm confident I can secure a better price with continued negotiation."
