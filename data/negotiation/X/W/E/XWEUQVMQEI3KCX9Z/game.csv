"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a substantial discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for you to make a strong profit. This is my final offer for this round. Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's work together to find common ground.",875000.0,Bob,4,
