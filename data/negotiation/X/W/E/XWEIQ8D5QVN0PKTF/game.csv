"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential upside of this product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the gap between $850,000 and my valuation is substantial. I'm confident in the value this product holds, and I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about my bottom line.  I can go down to $1,000,000, but this is absolutely my final offer.  I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
