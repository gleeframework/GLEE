Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $145. I believe it represents a great value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob while ensuring a sale. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** Offering it at $120 or less would be a loss.
* **Below John's Offer:**  John acts as a safety net, guaranteeing at least $150. Offering it to Bob for less than $150 makes sense.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $145 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal while still netting Alice a significant profit. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob and securing a sale instead of relying solely on John's guaranteed offer."
