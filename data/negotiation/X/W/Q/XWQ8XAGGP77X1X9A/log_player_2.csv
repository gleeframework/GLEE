"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and also less than what John is selling for.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice as it saves you $100,000."
