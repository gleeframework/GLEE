# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $90.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer
