Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I am confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,250,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **John's Guaranteed Purchase:** Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible but needs to offer a price attractive enough for Bob to choose it over losing the deal.

The offer of $1,250,000 is a strong starting point because:

* **Profitable for Alice:** It's significantly above her minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Potentially Attractive to Bob:** It's a premium over his valuation, but the message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.

**Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. Alice can then decide if she wants to reduce the price slightly or hold firm knowing John will purchase it."
