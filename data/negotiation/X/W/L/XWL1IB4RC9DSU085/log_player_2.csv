# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1100000. This is a competitive price considering the market value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is for $1,100,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's maximum price. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I see in the product, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

Bob should reject Alice's offer of $950,000. While it is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  He can try to negotiate a lower price again, or move on to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to make a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $925000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000.  Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is still above Bob's maximum price, and it's unlikely she'll go lower. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to accept the guaranteed price from John and avoid further negotiation."
