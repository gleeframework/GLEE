"I understand that you have a budget in mind, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product for $1050000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
