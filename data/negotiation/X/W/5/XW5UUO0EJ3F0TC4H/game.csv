"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $85. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $75. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $92? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my original price.",92.0,Alice,5,
