"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?"",

This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to my target while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $85. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, it's still above what John is offering. There's a chance to get the price down a bit further with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to split the difference between her last offer and my previous counteroffer, keeping the negotiation moving towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $75. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $92? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my original price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice doesn't seem willing to budge much from this price point. It's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a price significantly lower than $85, and at this point, it's more worthwhile to go with John's guaranteed offer of $80."
