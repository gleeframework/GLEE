"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a special opportunity tailored for someone with your unique needs and interests. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you, which you've indicated is $15,000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his ideal as possible. He's offering a price that's still above Alice's $8,000 value but is significantly lower than the initial offer. This leaves room for further negotiation but shows Bob is serious about a deal."
