"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is less than Bob's maximum, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $80, but still within his budget. A $90 offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While $95 is still more than the product's value to Alice, it's a good compromise.  It's within Bob's budget and there's a risk of Alice becoming less willing to negotiate further, especially as there's only a $5 difference between her offer and Bob's previous offer."
