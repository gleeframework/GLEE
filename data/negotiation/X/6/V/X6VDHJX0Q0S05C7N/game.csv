"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet at $9,500?  This would be a good compromise, and would allow us to both be happy with the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit closer to what you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is the next best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high. I'm really hoping to stay under $10,000. Would you consider $10,000? That would be a good price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really close to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $10,000, as it's worth more to me. I can offer it to you for $10,750. This is the next best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10750.0,Alice,7,
