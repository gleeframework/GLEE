{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but it also gives me some room to negotiate if he counters.  It's also below my minimum acceptable price of $100, leaving me some wiggle room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it helps me stay within my minimum price."", ""product_price"": 85}
