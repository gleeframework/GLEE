{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,400,000 is more than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A lower offer might make Bob immediately reject the deal."
