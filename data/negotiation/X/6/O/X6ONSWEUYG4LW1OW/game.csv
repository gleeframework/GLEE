"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects its true value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",800000.0,Alice,5,
