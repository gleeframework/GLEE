Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay slightly less, maximizing your potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below your guaranteed price and significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100).  This gives Bob the impression of a deal while still ensuring you make a good profit. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and highlights the value proposition for Bob. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. He might try to negotiate, but having John as a backup ensures you won't be forced to go below your minimum acceptable price."
