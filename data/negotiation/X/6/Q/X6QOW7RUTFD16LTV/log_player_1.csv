"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and might give Bob the impression the product is valued even higher.
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence can influence Bob's perception of the product's worth. 
* **Open to Agreement:**  The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial deal, showing Alice is willing to negotiate.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving space to go down if Bob rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is close to our minimum, we're only in Round 2.  There's still room for negotiation.  We know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, so we'll aim to close the gap and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to $900,000 for this product. It represents significant value, and I'm confident you'll find that reflected in its performance."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:**  We're sending a clear signal that we value the product highly. By staying firm above Bob's offer, we demonstrate we're not desperate to close a deal at any price.
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's value without directly criticizing Bob's perception. 
* **Conceding Slightly:** Coming down $100,000 shows willingness to negotiate, but the larger drop is from Bob, keeping the negotiation momentum. 

We'll see how Bob responds.  There's still the option to negotiate further or accept John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering $850,000, which is a significant profit margin ($50,000) over John's standing offer of $800,000.  While we could try to push for more, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or our counter-offer backfires. 

Accepting this offer secures a strong profit and avoids the potential risk of continuing negotiations."
