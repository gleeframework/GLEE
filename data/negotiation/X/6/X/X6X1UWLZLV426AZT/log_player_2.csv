"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $180. I think it's a great value, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $180 is significantly more than his $100 limit, and there's no reason to accept it on the first round. There are 9 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is my maximum price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $150.  This still leaves room for a good deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $150 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. There are 7 rounds remaining, giving him time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I really appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $150 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  How about $125?  This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 125}
