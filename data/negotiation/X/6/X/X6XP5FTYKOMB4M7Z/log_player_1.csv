Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm adjusting my price down slightly, hoping to meet in the middle with Bob. I believe this price is still fair considering my minimum price and Bob's willingness to pay $140."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $135 is closer to my minimum, Bob's offer is still lower than what I would like to receive.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees my minimum and is the best option at this point."
