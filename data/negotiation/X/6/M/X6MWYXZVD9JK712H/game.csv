"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at the moment. I'd be happy to pay $8500 for the product. It's still a fair price considering its value, and it's within my budget. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling the product for $11000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $9500 for the product. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm thinking of making another counteroffer, and I'm willing to sell the product for $10500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
