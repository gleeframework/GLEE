"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the high demand, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair offer considering the benefits you'll reap.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think your starting price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits the product offers.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I appreciate your perspective on the value,  $15,000 is considerably below what I can accept.  How about we meet halfway at $17,500? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $17,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits it offers.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $16,000 is pushing the limits of what I can accept. To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a higher price, but I've been prioritizing this deal with you.  My final offer is $16,800.  It's a take-it-or-leave-it offer.",16800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your honesty about having another buyer, but I'm not willing to go above $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $16,800, which would be $16,400. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits the product offers.",16000.0,Bob,6,
