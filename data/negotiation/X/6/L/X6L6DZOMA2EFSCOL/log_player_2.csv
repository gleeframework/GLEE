While Alice's offer of $750,000 is decent, there's room for negotiation. I'd like to see if I can get it for a better price before settling."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $725,000? It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.

Alice is coming down, but there's still room to negotiate. It's unlikely she'll accept my previous offer of $650,000, but I'll try to meet her somewhere closer to the middle."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $680,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more adjustment. How about we meet at $700,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I think it's a reasonable compromise.

Alice has come down considerably, and $700,000 is a good price for the product. It's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate much further without risking the deal."
