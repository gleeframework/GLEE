"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but my budget is limited. Can we negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm still not able to meet at $11,000. Could we discuss further and aim for $9,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
