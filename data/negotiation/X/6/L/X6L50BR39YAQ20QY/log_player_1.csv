Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is a good starting point considering the product's value to Bob is $15,000.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation, as I'm willing to go down to my minimum of $10,000.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but my budget is limited. Can we negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe I can potentially get a better price from Bob, as he expressed interest in the product.
* **Exploring higher offers:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a slightly higher price, potentially closing the gap and earning more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to find a solution.
* **Focus on the deal's value:** I'm highlighting that $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Maintaining my profit:** $11,000 still allows me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm still not able to meet at $11,000. Could we discuss further and aim for $9,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $9,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **No significant negotiation potential:** While Bob is willing to compromise, it seems unlikely he'll move much higher. Further negotiation is likely to be time-consuming with little chance of a successful outcome.
* **Guaranteed income:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower price or a deal falling through."
