"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, but still within a range that might be attractive to him. I'm also trying to build rapport by emphasizing the value of the product.  This should give me a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking for a lower price. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $120. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up to a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $90 again. Let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is persistent with his $90 offer, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer again and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value our conversation, but I'm really struggling to go lower than $95.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I believe $90 remains a reasonable offer. Let me know if there's any possibility to reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is stuck on his $90 offer and I'm not willing to go that low. I've already made two counteroffers, and there's no indication that he's willing to budge.  To avoid wasting more time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. This ensures I get my minimum value and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
