"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a high initial agreement.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" and framing the price as ""fair"" aims to make the offer more palatable to Bob. 
* **Alternative Option:**  The presence of John (offering $1,000,000) acts as a safety net and gives us leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than our target price and his perceived value. We have room to negotiate and leverage our alternative option (selling to John)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway – how about $1,300,000? This reflects the product's true worth and provides a win-win scenario for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  We're showing willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not giving in entirely.
* **Justification:**  We're reiterating the product's value and positioning this counteroffer as a ""win-win."" 
* **Maintaining Value:**  The $1,300,000 price point is a strong middle ground that keeps us well above our guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let's make it happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking Point:** Bob is firm at $1,200,000, but this doesn't mean we have to settle. We still have negotiating power and time.
* **Time Pressure:**  By Round 4, we can start applying subtle time pressure. Bob wants to close the deal, and delaying tactics can work in our favor. 
* **Alternative Safety:** John's offer provides a safety net. We're not desperate to accept a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, and I respect that. However, I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. I've already moved considerably from my initial proposal. I'm willing to accept $1,250,000 – that's my final offer.  I need to make a decision quickly, as I have other potential buyers interested."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** We're signaling this is our final offer to add pressure and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Slight Concession:** We're moving slightly closer to his $1,200,000, showing a willingness to compromise, but not by much.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're introducing a sense of urgency by mentioning ""other potential buyers,"" even though our agreement with John doesn't have a hard deadline. This could push Bob to close the deal."
