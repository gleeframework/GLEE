This offer is a starting point. It's below my minimum acceptable price, but still above Bob's perceived value. This allows for potential negotiation, while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and even below his own perceived value of $800,000.  I need to counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $700,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I need to try and get closer to $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming to bridge the gap and see if we can finalize a deal."
