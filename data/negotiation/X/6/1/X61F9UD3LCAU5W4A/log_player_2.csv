{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still higher than John's offer. This is a good starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. It also gives Bob some room to move up if Alice is hesitant."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is only $80,000 more than John's price.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance Alice won't budge much further.  Accepting her offer secures the product at a reasonable price, saving time and effort."
