"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still attractive to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground. By reducing my price slightly, I show flexibility while still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial offer and gives me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $100 is closer to my desired price, I still think I can get a little more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $102? It's still a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 102}
```

I'm dropping my price to $102. This is a small concession, but I'm trying to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, as it's still a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $99. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's only $99, it's a decent profit for me and it's likely that we're close to the end of the negotiation. It's better to get this deal done than risk losing him altogether and having to sell to John for less."
