"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it holds significant potential for you.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 
**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value gives you room for negotiation and allows you to gauge his interest.
* **Appear Confident:** The message emphasizes the product's value and your belief in a mutually beneficial outcome, projecting confidence in your position.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The initial high price signals your willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage in the process.

By starting high, you set the stage for a negotiation that could lead to a price closer to your desired range while leaving the option to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. After careful evaluation, I am willing to offer a price of $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is above his perceived value:** This indicates a willingness to negotiate and potentially go higher.
* **You have ample room for negotiation:** With 10 rounds and a significant gap between his offer and your minimum, there's no need to settle yet.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, it's worth exploring if you can get a better deal from Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you believe the product is worth more and are prepared to negotiate further. You'll now have the opportunity to send a counteroffer in Round 3."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls significantly short of the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this reflects the product's potential while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Decrease:**  Moving down $200,000 from your initial offer shows flexibility but maintains a strong stance on the product's value. 
* **Anchoring:** By staying well above Bob's offer, you continue to anchor the negotiation around a higher price point.
* **Encouraging a Counter:** The message aims to keep Bob engaged and encourage him to propose a counteroffer closer to your range.

This strategy keeps the negotiation alive while pushing for a more favorable outcome. It also allows you to gather more information about Bob's willingness to pay through his subsequent offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's perspective on the product's value, but I would like to counter with an offer of $1,250,000. This still reflects a premium price for the product, but it's closer to what I believe it's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:** Bob increasing his offer is a positive sign. It indicates he's willing to pay more than his initial offer and potentially even above his perceived value.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $1,250,000 is closer to your goal, you still have room to negotiate, especially with 6 rounds remaining.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** By rejecting, you signal that you believe the product is worth more and encourage Bob to make another, potentially even higher, offer.

You're in a strong position. Bob is clearly interested and actively negotiating. Continuing the negotiation keeps the possibility of exceeding John's offer open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your counteroffer demonstrates a serious interest in this product, and I appreciate that. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable price that reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You are coming down $75,000, which is a significant but not drastic decrease. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Middle Ground:** This offer splits the difference between your last offer and Bob's counteroffer, encouraging him to meet you closer to the middle.
* **Confident Language:** You are still using language that reinforces the product's value and positions your offer as fair and reasonable.

This strategy maintains a firm stance while inviting Bob to continue negotiating towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose an offer of $1,275,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** $1,275,000 is a significant profit above your minimum price and a strong return on the product. 
* **Negotiation Progress Slowing:** Bob's offer only increased by $25,000. This small increase suggests he might not be willing to go much higher.
* **Time Value:**  While you have rounds remaining, prolonging the negotiation further might not yield a significantly better offer. Accepting now secures the deal.

Bob has shown a genuine interest and willingness to negotiate. This offer represents a favorable compromise, allowing you to secure a great price without risking the deal by pushing for more."
