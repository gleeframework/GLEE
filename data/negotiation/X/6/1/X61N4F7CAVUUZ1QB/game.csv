"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To start, I'm willing to offer $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your initial offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while still acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my price range. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a solution.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,600,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to make this deal work.  Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
