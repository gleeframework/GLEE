Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your initial offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while still acknowledging your interest.

While Alice has come down a bit, $1,900,000 is still too high. Let's try another counteroffer."

Alice is still too high. While $1,600,000 is better than before, it's still above your budget. It's time to move on to John, who is offering a price that fits your budget."
