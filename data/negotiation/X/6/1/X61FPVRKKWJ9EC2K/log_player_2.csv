"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $13,500. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  While $13,500 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. Would you be willing to settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair deal to me."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've considered your offer carefully, and I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000 even? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below her product's value of $12,000.  While she calls it her final offer, she may be bluffing. However, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to that price and you losing the opportunity to buy from John for $10,000.  You've already gotten her to come down considerably, and John's price is your ideal outcome."
