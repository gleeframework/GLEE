"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to you.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $13,500. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  While $13,500 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. Would you be willing to settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've considered your offer carefully, and I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000 even? This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
