"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $12000 for the product. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12000 is still outside my budget.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go over $9000. If you're willing to consider that, I'm ready to finalize the purchase.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your seriousness. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $9000, so I'll offer you $10500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm very close to my maximum budget. How about we split the difference again and settle on $9750?  If that works for you, I'm ready to buy right now.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're close to your maximum budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9750. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer you $10000, which is the minimum I need to get from this sale. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
