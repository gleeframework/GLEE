Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, giving me room to negotiate. It's important to remember that I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm aiming for a higher price to see if he's willing to pay it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $12,000.  This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close enough to my desired price and significantly better than selling to John. Accepting this offer maximizes my profit while still being a reasonable deal."
