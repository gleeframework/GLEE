Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Considering Bob's value:**  I've priced it below what the product is worth to Bob ($1,200,000), making it appealing for him.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  There's still space for Bob to counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to negotiate further.
* **Security with John:**  Knowing I have a backup buyer in John for $1,000,000 means I can comfortably walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $900000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Accepting it would be a substantial loss.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially close the gap.
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $1,000,000 provides me with a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price, but I won't settle for an offer that's drastically below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still allows for a good profit margin for both of us. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, emphasizing the potential for a profitable deal.
* **Mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as one that benefits both parties, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still some room for further negotiation, but I'm setting a firmer stance compared to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1000000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1025000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  Accepting it would mean a slight profit. 
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or further concessions, potentially pushing the price lower.
* **John as a safety net:** I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if this deal falls through. 

This is a good deal considering the potential for prolonged negotiations and the certainty of John's offer. I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid further risk."
