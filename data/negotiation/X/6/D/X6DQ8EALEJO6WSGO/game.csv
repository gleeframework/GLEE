"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you!  I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit high. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $150 to make this worthwhile.  Would you be open to $155?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $130 is still not a price I can work with. I'm willing to go a little lower than my previous offer, but $145 is the absolute minimum I can accept. Let me know if you're interested at this price.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $137.50?",137.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $142.50 for this final offer. This is really the best I can do, so let me know if you're interested.",142.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $135, but that's as low as I can go.",135.0,Bob,8,
