Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could net you a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $145 is a price point that is:
    * Above Bob's perceived value ($120), so he sees it as a potential loss if he rejects.
    * Below your minimum acceptable price ($150), ensuring you still make a profit.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
