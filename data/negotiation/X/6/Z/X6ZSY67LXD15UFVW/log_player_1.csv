Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob's offer of $780,000 is tempting, it's clear he's unlikely to go any higher. Accepting it would mean leaving $20,000 on the table compared to John's offer.  Selling to John for $800,000 ensures a guaranteed return that meets my minimum acceptable price."
