"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm thinking closer to $700,000 would be a reasonable price.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I could consider a price of $875,000. This offer reflects a more accurate valuation.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value, but I have a budget in mind. Could we possibly settle at $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While $750,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $825,000 as a final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product while hopefully fitting within your budget.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is my final offer. I can do $780,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",780000.0,Bob,6,
