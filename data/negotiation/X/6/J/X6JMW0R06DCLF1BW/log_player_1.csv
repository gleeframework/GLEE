"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **Being Friendly:** Using a friendly and positive message can help build rapport and increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  I'm not starting at my absolute minimum price of $120, leaving room to adjust if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.  I can also use John as a leverage point in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway. This can make him feel like we're working together to find a solution.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable, but also acknowledging his budget constraints.
* **Clear Offer:** I'm presenting a specific counter-offer with a clear price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, could we possibly agree on $105 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I want to see if I can push for a bit more, especially as I have John as a backup option.  I'm confident that with a few more rounds, I can secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. But $105 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $107.50?  This would allow me to make a profit while you get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing continued willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob almost halfway this time. 
* **Focusing on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a way for both of us to benefit.
* **Specific Offer:** I'm providing a clear and specific counteroffer to encourage Bob to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've been considering your offers and I think we can reach an agreement. Could we settle on $106 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $106 is only $4 away from my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'd have to sell to John at a lower profit.  $106 is a decent profit considering the circumstances."
