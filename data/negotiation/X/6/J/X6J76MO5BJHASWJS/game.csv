"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,350,000,  which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
