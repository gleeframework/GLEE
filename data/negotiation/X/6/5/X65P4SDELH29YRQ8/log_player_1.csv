"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product's value to both of us.  If Bob rejects, I can then assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if it's better to sell to John for a guaranteed $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $100, which is the product's minimum value to me. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price to $110. This is a compromise, but it still allows me to make a profit while demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. If Bob rejects again, I might consider selling to John in the next round, especially if he makes a counteroffer lower than $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $100. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. If he continues to offer below my minimum, I will likely sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $105. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer and above my minimum acceptable price. If he rejects this, I'll sell to John in the next round to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've already made several concessions, and it seems unlikely he'll meet my price. To avoid further rounds of negotiation that might lead to a lower price, I will sell to John for $100."
