"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at $1,400,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation and shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to Bob. This helps him understand the potential benefits of buying, even at a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm ending with an open question, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price that considers its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially achieve a better price. 
* **Time is not a major factor:**  With 8 rounds remaining, I can afford to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's unfortunately far below what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a significant price reduction and reflects a genuine desire to work with you. Let's find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a substantial compromise:**  I'm dropping the price by $400,000 from my previous offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight mutual benefit:**  I'm emphasizing that finding a solution that benefits both of us is my priority. This builds trust and encourages further negotiation.
* **Maintain my minimum:** My counteroffer is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, giving me room to negotiate further. 
* **Keep the door open:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion by asking Bob to consider finding a solution that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're making concessions, but that price is still a little too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. This seems like a fair deal considering we're both making compromises. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, $800,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is still on my side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I can afford to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiating room:**  Even though Bob's offer is getting closer, there's still room for further negotiation and compromise.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to potentially reach a higher price in the subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $800,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference: I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us much closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and persistence:** I'm continuing to show flexibility by offering a compromise, but I'm staying firm on a price above my minimum.
* **Focus on fairness and progress:** By framing it as a ""fair compromise"" and highlighting the progress made, I'm trying to create a sense of momentum towards a deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum, so I haven't given up too much ground. 
* **Time is on my side:** With 5 rounds left, I'm not rushing to accept an offer that is below my desired price point."
