"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price that considers its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's unfortunately far below what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a significant price reduction and reflects a genuine desire to work with you. Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're making concessions, but that price is still a little too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. This seems like a fair deal considering we're both making compromises.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $800,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference: I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us much closer to a deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
