"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? ",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is the absolute max I can afford.  I'm really hoping we can make this work.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation, and I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still working within your budget.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  $9,500 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  I think that's a fair compromise that works for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,6,
