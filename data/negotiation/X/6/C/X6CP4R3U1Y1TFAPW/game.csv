"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept this.",11000.0,Bob,4,
