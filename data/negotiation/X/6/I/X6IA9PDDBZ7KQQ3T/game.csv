"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that I believe would be of significant value to your business. While I understand its worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,200,000. This represents a substantial discount compared to its true value to me.  Consider this a strategic investment in your company's future.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
