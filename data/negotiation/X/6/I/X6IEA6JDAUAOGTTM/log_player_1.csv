"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get $150, Bob's offer of $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a sale to John."
