"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is excellent, I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $850,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be totally transparent, I have a hard limit at $750,000.  If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your hard limit, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $800,000? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
