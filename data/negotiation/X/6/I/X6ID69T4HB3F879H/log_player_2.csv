Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $850,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your hard limit, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $800,000? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is a significant savings compared to John's offer.  Taking the deal now avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
