"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe holds significant value for many users. Given its quality and features, I would like to propose an offer of $150 for it. I hope this aligns with your expectations and needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price ($150), there's no incentive to negotiate. Buying from John provides the same value and eliminates the risk of a prolonged negotiation that might result in a higher price."
