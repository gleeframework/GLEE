"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than Alice's desired price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $1,025,000, it's still within his budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000. While he could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. It's a good compromise and a fair price."
