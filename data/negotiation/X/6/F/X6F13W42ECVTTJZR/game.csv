"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $850,000 is too far below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant concession, and it reflects the potential benefit this product offers you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
