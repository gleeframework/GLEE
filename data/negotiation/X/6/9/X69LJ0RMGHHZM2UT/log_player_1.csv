Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before anyone else. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $100 (John), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value leaves space for potential negotiation. He might try to haggle, and you can then ""reluctantly"" decrease the price to $110 or even $105, still making a profit.
* **Polite and encouraging message:**  The message aims to be persuasive without being pushy, highlighting the product's value to Bob. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still having a good chance of selling to Bob."
