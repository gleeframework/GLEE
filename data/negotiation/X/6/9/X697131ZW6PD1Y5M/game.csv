"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm not comfortable with $15000. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13000,  which still reflects the value I place on this product.  Let's find a middle ground. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $13000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11000.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
