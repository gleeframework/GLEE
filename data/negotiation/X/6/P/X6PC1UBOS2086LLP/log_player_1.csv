Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,350,000. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $1,000,000? I believe this could be a mutually beneficial arrangement.
