"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $12,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I believe the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. While it is a step in the right direction, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, and Bob might be able to reach a deal within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product and my limited budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'm offering the product to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While it's closer, Bob has a better option at this point: he can buy the product from John for $10,000.  It's risky to continue negotiating, as Alice has shown she's willing to hold firm on her price, and Bob might end up paying more than he wants."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I've decided to go with another seller who has offered the product for $10,000. Thank you for your time and consideration."", ""product_price"": 0} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has decided to buy the product from John for $10,000. This is a better deal for him compared to Alice's offer of $10,500.  This ends the negotiation with Alice, and Bob gets the product at a lower price."
