"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need it to be more affordable. Would you consider a lower price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is my best price for now.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $700,000. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my final offer for now.",950000.0,Alice,5,
