Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to selling at your minimum price to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very keen, while still securing a profit for you.
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price of $119 seems like a ""deal"" compared to a round number like $120, potentially making it more appealing to Bob. 
 
**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate further, or reject it outright.  However, this offer gives you the best chance of maximizing your potential profit."
