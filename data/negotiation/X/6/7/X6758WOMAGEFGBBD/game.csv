"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure I can meet you halfway. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $18000? I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns about making a profit, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm willing to pay $14000. Can you consider this compromise?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $14000. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on price. How about we try $16500? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,5,
