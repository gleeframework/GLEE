Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is above Bob's valuation of $800,000 but significantly less than my minimum of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation but still ensures I make a profit.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging. I highlight the value of the product to Bob and emphasize the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 

**Strategy:**

* By starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, I aim to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations. I have a backup buyer (John) who will pay my minimum price. This gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my ideal. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer. He's already shown interest and is willing to negotiate.
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is guaranteed, but it's not the best outcome. I'm aiming for a higher price if possible. 
* **Building Relationship:** Rejecting this offer doesn't necessarily mean losing Bob as a buyer. It allows me to continue the conversation and potentially build a stronger relationship for future transactions. 

**Next Step:**

In the next round, I will send Bob a counteroffer, likely aiming for a price between $900,000 and $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $900,000 isn't quite where I need to be. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would still be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product incredibly valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $950,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. This shows I'm willing to be flexible and reach a compromise.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone while also emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Strategy:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By proposing a price halfway between our previous offers, I aim to demonstrate my willingness to compromise and encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still slightly above Bob's desired price, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary. I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, which gives me a backup plan and leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $920,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,200,000. I've reached a point where the potential for further negotiation is limited, and the risk of losing a guaranteed sale to John outweighs the possibility of squeezing out a slightly higher price from Bob. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me a significant profit, which is my priority. 
* **Limited Negotiating Room:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is close to his maximum, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a drawn-out process. 
* **Time Value:**  Time is also a factor. Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take longer and potentially delay the sale, costing me both time and potential earnings. 

**Conclusion:**

It's a tough decision, but selling to John for $1,200,000 offers the most secure and profitable outcome at this point."
