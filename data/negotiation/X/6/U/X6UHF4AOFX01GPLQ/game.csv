"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $10,000 is significantly below what I'm comfortable with. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
