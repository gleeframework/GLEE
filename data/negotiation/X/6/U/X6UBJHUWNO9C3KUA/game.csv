"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $10,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.",10000.0,Alice,3,
