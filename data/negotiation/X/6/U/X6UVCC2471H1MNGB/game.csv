"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway between $120 and $105. How about we try $112.50?",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a lower offer of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about we meet you halfway between $112.50 and $100? I can offer it to you for $106.25.",106.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $106.25 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'll stick with my previous counteroffer of $100. If you're not willing to sell it to me for that price, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $150",100.0,Bob,6,
