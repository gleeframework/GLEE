"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice knows you value the product at $12,000. Her opening offer of $9,000 leaves room for negotiation. She's aiming for the highest profit margin.
* **Your Power:** You have an alternative (John) at a fixed price of $12,000.  This gives you leverage. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting Alice's first offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal.  Alice is likely to counter-offer with a lower price, hoping to avoid losing the sale."
