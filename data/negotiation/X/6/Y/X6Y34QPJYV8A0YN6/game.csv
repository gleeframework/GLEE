"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to me. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $8,500.  This reflects the value of the product to me, and it's still a great price for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be flexible.  $7,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000 as a final offer.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options.",8000.0,Alice,5,
