,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $95,  which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $105 is closer, I'm still stuck at $95.  That's my absolute top limit, and I think it's a fair offer considering the product's value to me.  Let's close the deal.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is your top limit, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $100. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,7,
