"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold opening, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good deal.  I'm aware this might be rejected, but it's important to start high and then be prepared to negotiate down if necessary."

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable value. While I would prefer a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for $1,500,000 is too high. I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure the sale and get a good price."
