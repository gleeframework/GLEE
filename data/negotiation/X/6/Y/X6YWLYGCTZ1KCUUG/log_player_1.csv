"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price that's close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  The offer is not too far from my minimum acceptable price, allowing for flexibility during negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:**  This first offer will gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore further options. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John is a guaranteed $800,000, I'm hopeful that I can secure a higher price with Bob through continued negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair offer:** $900,000 is still a good profit for me while remaining attractive to Bob, considering his perceived value.
* **Strategic positioning:**  This offer is strategically placed to entice Bob to accept, especially since he rejected my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the deal:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm running out of rounds. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's no guarantee that Bob will come up further in price, and I risk reaching the end of the negotiation without a deal.
* **Secure profit:** Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit, and it's a significant amount of money.

While I would prefer a higher price, the risk of failing to reach an agreement and having to sell to John at a lower price outweighs the potential for a slightly higher offer."
