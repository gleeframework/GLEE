,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $125. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  It's a fair compromise and I'd be happy to buy the product at that price.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $112.50. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115, which is just a slight adjustment from my previous offer. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",115.0,Alice,5,
