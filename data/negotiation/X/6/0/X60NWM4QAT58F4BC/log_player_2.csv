Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing item.

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good price, and it's closer to your target than John's price of $800,000. You could try to negotiate further, but the risk is that Alice will walk away, leaving you with only the option of buying from John."
