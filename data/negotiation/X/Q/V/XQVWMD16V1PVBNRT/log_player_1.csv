Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm asking for $11,500. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid a Lowball:** Offering a price too close to John's $10,000 offer risks losing Bob's interest and forces Alice to accept the lower price.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message highlights the product's value and presents the price with confidence, making it more appealing to Bob."
