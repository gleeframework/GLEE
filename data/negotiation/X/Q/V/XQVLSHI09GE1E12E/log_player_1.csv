"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. It's a significant discount from my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  This should incentivize Bob to make a counteroffer while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $13,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but still allows for a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low for me.  I'm hoping to get closer to my target price in the next round, but with only 6 rounds left, I need to start considering selling to John as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway at $12,500.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but still leaves room for some profit. With only 5 rounds left, I need to start making bigger concessions to see if I can secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting a bit too risky. While I'd like to continue negotiating, we're down to only 4 rounds left. There's no guarantee that Bob will meet my price, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure thing.  John is offering a price that meets my minimum, so it's time to sell to him and secure a solid profit."
