{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  At $11,000, I'm still making a profit, but leaving some room for negotiation.
* **It's below my minimum acceptable price:** This means if Bob rejects, I still have the option to sell to John for my minimum. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, so I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800. This is a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,800 is still a bit more than I can manage right now.  I'm willing to go up to $10,200.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, his offer of $10,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price. It's getting close, but I'm not willing to risk losing out on a guaranteed $12,000 from John.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a sure thing."
