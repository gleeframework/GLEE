This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still providing you with a substantial profit. 

It's important to remember that this is just the first step in the negotiation process. You'll need to be flexible and adapt to Bob's responses to maximize your earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still lower than the initial offer you made. Rejecting this offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to push the price closer to your desired range.  You can potentially get a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for some profit. You're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while maintaining your position that the product is worth more than $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
