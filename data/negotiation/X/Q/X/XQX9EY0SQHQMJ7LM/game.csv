"I'm interested in the product, but I think $9500 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8800?",8800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $9200? I think that's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to go up to $8900, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",8900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be fair as well.  How about we split the difference and go with $9050? This is a small compromise for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",9050.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9050. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which would be $8950. Can you consider that?",8950.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $8950 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference again - how about $9000? This is a small step for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think $9000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $8800. Can you reconsider?",8800.0,Bob,8,
