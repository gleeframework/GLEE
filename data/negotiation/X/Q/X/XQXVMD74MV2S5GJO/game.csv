,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $1300000?  This gives us both room to compromise and ensure a good deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1250000.  This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, but $1150000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. This price reflects the product's value and allows us to finalize the deal.  Let's make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
