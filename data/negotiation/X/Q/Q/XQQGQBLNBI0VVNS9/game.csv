"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I believe is worth at least $1000000 to me.  I know this product holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1150000. This price is a fair reflection of its worth, and allows for a healthy profit margin for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
