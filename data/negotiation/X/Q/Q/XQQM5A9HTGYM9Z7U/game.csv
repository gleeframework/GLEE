"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is undeniable, and $2,300,000 is a fair reflection of its potential.  To move things forward, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's consider $2,050,000.",2050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from $2,050,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value and the market conditions.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,700,000 is significantly below my bottom line for this product. I'm open to finding a solution, so I'm willing to come down to $1,925,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise considering its true value.",1925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,925,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,800,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
