"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other interested parties.  Given its unique value, I'm valuing it at $1,900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. You are much better off buying from John at $1,200,000, saving you a considerable amount of money."
