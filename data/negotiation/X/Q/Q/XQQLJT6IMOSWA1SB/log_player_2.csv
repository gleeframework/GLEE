Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I can offer you the product for $107.50. It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for the value you'll get from the product.

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit, and while I could try to negotiate further, the difference is getting very small. $107.50 is a reasonable price and a good deal compared to John's offer."
