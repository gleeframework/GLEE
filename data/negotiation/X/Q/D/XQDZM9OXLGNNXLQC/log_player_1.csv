Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still within the range where Bob might be willing to buy. It's important to leave room for negotiation, but I don't want to undervalue my product too early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below what it's worth to me. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly from my initial offer. I want to test if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price point. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation, while still ensuring I don't lose too much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me, and I'm starting to get the feeling we're not going to be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  To avoid wasting more time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. It's the best option to ensure I get my desired price point."
