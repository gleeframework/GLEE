"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  I'm open to discussing this further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm willing to accept. This product has considerable potential beyond the current market value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $1,850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential of the product.",1850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's try to find a number we can both agree on.  Would you consider $1,875,000?",1875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,825,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. I'd like to get closer to my target price of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Bob,6,
