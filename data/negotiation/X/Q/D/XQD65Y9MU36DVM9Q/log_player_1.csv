"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm willing to accept. This product has considerable potential beyond the current market value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $1,850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,850,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. We're making progress, and I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,825,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. I'd like to get closer to my target price of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at $1,800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob has stalled out at $1,800,000 and even revealed his target price is significantly lower.  This suggests it's unlikely he'll come close to my $1,500,000 minimum. I'm better off taking the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risking further negotiation with Bob."
