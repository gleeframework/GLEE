Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it's worth at least $10,000 to you. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm offering it to you for $12,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value to Bob, Alice anchors the price in his mind around the $10,000 mark, making the offer seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room:**  The $12,500 offer allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can still come down slightly and make a profit.
* **Backup Plan:** Knowing John is a guaranteed sale at $10,000 gives Alice leverage. She's not desperate to sell at any cost.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still presenting a compelling offer to Bob."
