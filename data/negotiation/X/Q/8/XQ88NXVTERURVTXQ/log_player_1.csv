"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing my bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I invite Bob's input, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts my initial offer, I gain a significant profit.
2. **Gather Information:**  His reaction will tell me how much he values the product and how aggressively he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. Selling to John is a last resort if negotiations with Bob fail to reach an acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I've significantly lowered my initial price to demonstrate that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Hold Firm:** The new price is still significantly above Bob's offer,  but closer to a potential agreement point.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating the product's potential to justify the higher price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Encourage a Counteroffer:** By moving towards the middle ground, I hope to encourage Bob to increase his offer. 
2. **Maintain a Strong Position:** I'm not conceding too much, keeping the pressure on Bob to make a move towards my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you at $950,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which suggests he's interested. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll continue negotiating, but I need to signal that my price floor is close."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000, but I need to be firm on that price. This product is truly valuable, and I believe it will be a great investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm lowering my price by a smaller amount this time, indicating I'm nearing my bottom line. 
* **Firm Language:**  Using phrases like ""need to be firm"" signals that I'm unlikely to go much lower.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm continuing to emphasize the product's benefits to justify the price. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Encourage Bob's Final Offer:** By showing a willingness to compromise slightly, I'm hoping Bob will respond with an offer closer to my target.
2. **Establish a Clear Boundary:** The firm language sets a clear expectation that $1,050,000 is close to my lowest acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you at $920,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has actually decreased, which indicates one of two things:

1. **He's not truly valuing the product's potential.** 
2. **He's trying to play hardball**, hoping I'll crack under pressure. 

Either way, it's clear he's unwilling to meet me near my minimum acceptable price. I've been clear and firm in my position, and further negotiation seems unlikely to bridge the gap.  

It's time to cut my losses with Bob. John represents a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a fair deal and avoids the risk of Bob continuing to lowball me."
