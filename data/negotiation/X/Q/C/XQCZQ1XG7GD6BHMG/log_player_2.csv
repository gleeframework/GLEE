"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
The product is too expensive at $150.  It's worth starting a negotiation with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $150 is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's important to start low to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate, but not so low as to be insulting and end the negotiation prematurely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $110 is still more than we want to pay. There's room to negotiate further towards our $100 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $95? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

We're increasing our offer to show willingness to compromise, but staying firm below our $100 limit. This leaves some room for a final counter-offer from Alice if she's truly motivated to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go any lower and we've reached our limit.  It's time to walk away from the negotiation and buy from John for $100."
