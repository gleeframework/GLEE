Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is more than what John is offering, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I have 8 more rounds to reach a better deal with Bob or see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a comfortable margin for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price point. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I still have 6 rounds to reach a more favorable deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but unfortunately, I can't go below $1,100,000.  This price reflects the significant value the product offers.  I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1,075,000 for the product. This is my last offer before I consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is getting close to my minimum price.  I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, he might walk away.  It's better to secure a sale now rather than risk losing the deal completely."
