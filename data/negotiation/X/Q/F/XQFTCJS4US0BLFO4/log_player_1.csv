Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This offer starts at a point where Bob still has significant value to gain (200k) while I secure a decent profit over my minimum. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob is inclined to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While $950,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on his counteroffer. This still gives him a decent profit margin, but brings me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is only $25,000 less than my previous counteroffer and significantly higher than selling to John. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids further potential negotiation risks."
