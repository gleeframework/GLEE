Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $135.  This is a fair price considering the product is worth $120 to both of us, and it gives me a little room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $125 is close to my minimum price of $120.  It's better to accept his offer than risk a counteroffer that might be lower or to sell to John for the same price."
