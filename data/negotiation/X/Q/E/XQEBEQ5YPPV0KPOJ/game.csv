"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1,100,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $950,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but to make this work for me, I'd need to be at $980,000. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $980,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,020,000, but I need to make a profit. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
