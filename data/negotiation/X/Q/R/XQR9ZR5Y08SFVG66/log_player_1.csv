Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $2,000,000.  I know it's a significant investment, but I'm confident it's one that will pay dividends for you given its value proposition."",

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** We have a single negotiation opportunity with Bob. If he rejects our offer, we have a guaranteed fallback option with John at our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Value to Bob:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving us room to negotiate above our minimum.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a higher initial offer ($2,000,000) sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, we're likely to land at a price higher than if we started low. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We don't know Bob's negotiation style or how much he's willing to spend. There's a risk he could find our initial offer too high and walk away.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, we might consider a less aggressive starting price.  

This offer balances maximizing our potential profit with the understanding that we have a strong alternative if Bob declines."
