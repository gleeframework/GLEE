"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Openness:** I'm expressing willingness to negotiate to show flexibility. 
* **Asking for Feedback:** This invites Bob to engage and provides an opportunity to understand his perspective on the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  While I'm happy to sell for $120, I want to see if I can do better.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested and willing to pay at least $120, which indicates there's potential for a higher offer. 
* **Strategic Play:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me the opportunity to explore a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest!  I can't go as low as $120, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial asking price.
* **Reinforce Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that $135 is still a fair price.
* **Maintain Openness:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation by asking ""What do you think?"""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $135, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Time Pressure:** We are already in Round 4, leaving fewer rounds to reach a deal. Accepting now avoids risking a lower offer from Bob or needing to sell to John.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** Even if I accept, I can always try to negotiate a higher price for shipping or additional services in the future."
