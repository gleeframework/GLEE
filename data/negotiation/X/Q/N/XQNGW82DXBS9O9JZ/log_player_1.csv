Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price is fair considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell for less than $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $10,000 gives Alice a $2,000 profit margin while still leaving a $2,000 incentive for Bob to buy.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price Bob is likely to accept and a price that maximizes Alice's profit."
