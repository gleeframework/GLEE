Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth in the market. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, there's a chance to earn an extra $100,000 if Bob accepts our offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offered price is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), leaving room for negotiation if needed.
    *  Attractive enough compared to the guaranteed sale price to incentivize Bob to consider it seriously.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale."
