Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $175 is higher than the $100 Bob is willing to pay, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $175 is still above your $150 minimum, so you're not giving away the product for less than you want.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  This price will give you the opportunity to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate it, but I can only afford to pay up to $150 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price.  While you could try to negotiate further, accepting his offer is the most efficient way to secure a sale and avoid potentially losing the deal altogether."
