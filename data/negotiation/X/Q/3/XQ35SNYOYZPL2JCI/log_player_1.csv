Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect to make Bob feel like he's getting a good price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've successfully negotiated a good price. 
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own. 
* **If the negotiation stalls:**  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $15,000 I can get from John.
* **I have leverage:** I know I can get a better price from John, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob.
* **Counteroffering could lead to a better outcome:**  I can use this opportunity to see if I can convince Bob to come closer to my price point. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between $9,000 and my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm looking for something a bit closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile for me. I'm confident this product will bring you great value, and I'm willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $11,000 is halfway between Bob's offer of $9,000 and my desired price of $12,000. This shows a willingness to compromise without drastically reducing my profit.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the value the product will bring to Bob, making him feel like the price is justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I reiterate my willingness to work with Bob to reach a mutually acceptable price. This keeps the negotiation open and avoids a stalemate.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price while still leaving room for potential future negotiations. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own, considering my minimum acceptable price and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a better price than $9,000.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $10,000 is closer to my minimum, but it's still below the $15,000 I can get from John.
* **Limited Upside:**  There's not much room for further negotiation with Bob.  Continuing to haggle might only lead to further rejection.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation headaches.

**Next Steps:**

* I will contact John and finalize the sale at $15,000, ensuring a profitable outcome."
