Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair.  This offer is time-sensitive as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is a substantial profit for me, while still offering Bob a significant discount from my alternative offer. This creates a strong incentive for him to accept.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning other interested parties adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob towards a quicker decision. 

This approach balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
