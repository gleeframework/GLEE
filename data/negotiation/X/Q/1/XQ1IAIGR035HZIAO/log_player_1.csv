"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high asking price without revealing your minimum.
* **Future Rounds:** This initial offer sets the stage for future rounds of negotiation. Bob's response will give you valuable information about his price sensitivity, allowing you to adjust your strategy accordingly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** While you know Bob values the product at $800,000, he doesn't know your valuation. This information asymmetry works in your favor.
* **John as Leverage:** You always have the option to walk away and sell to John for your minimum acceptable price. This knowledge gives you power in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm very interested in this product but can't go higher than $800,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While his message suggests he's serious about the purchase, accepting $800,000 would leave a substantial amount of money on the table.  

**Next Steps:** 

You need to signal to Bob that his initial offer is unacceptable while also encouraging him to engage in a meaningful negotiation. A counteroffer that's still above your minimum but lower than your initial offer would be a strategic move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, my initial offer reflects the true value and potential this product holds. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction and demonstrates my willingness to make a deal happen."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Not Excessive Reduction:** Lowering the price by $300,000 shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but it's not such a drastic drop that it undermines your position or suggests desperation.
* **Reiterating Value:** By again mentioning the ""true value and potential,"" you're subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth and justifying the still-high price. 
* **Encouraging a Counter:**  This counteroffer aims to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. It's unlikely he'll accept immediately, but it opens the door for him to make a counter-proposal that moves the negotiation closer to a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still very interested in this product, but $1,900,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, $950,000 is still significantly less than your minimum acceptable price and your desired outcome. It's clear he's still trying to negotiate below the product's true worth.

**Next Steps:**

You need to firmly hold your ground. A smaller counteroffer closer to your minimum will signal to Bob that you're serious about your valuation and encourage him to make a more realistic offer if he's truly interested."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,700,000. This offer reflects the significant value this product brings and is my final concession."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer lowers the price by $200,000, showing some movement but also emphasizing the value you place on the product.
* **""Final Concession"":** By stating this is your final concession, you create a sense of urgency and signal that you're nearing your walk-away point.  
* **Encouraging a Serious Offer:** This counteroffer aims to push Bob into making a more serious offer if he truly intends to purchase the product. 
* **Time Consideration:**  Five rounds have passed, and while you have time remaining, you need to start moving towards a close or consider John's offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,700,000 is still too far above what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's find a way to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has significantly increased his offer, $1,100,000 is still considerably lower than your $1,500,000 minimum.  More importantly, his message suggests this is his ""absolute limit,"" which may be a negotiating tactic but also indicates he might not be willing to move much higher.

**Next Steps:**

Given the circumstances, it's time to leverage John's offer.  In the next round, you should present Bob with a final offer close to your minimum, emphasizing that you have another buyer willing to pay your full asking price. This will:

* **Signal Seriousness:**  Bob will understand you're not bluffing and are prepared to walk away.
* **Potentially Secure a Higher Offer:**  He might be willing to increase his offer closer to your minimum to avoid losing the deal.
* **Minimize Risk:** If Bob doesn't budge, you can confidently sell to John without wasting more time on potentially fruitless negotiations."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've considered your offer carefully, but I can't accept anything below $1,450,000. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer prepared to pay my full asking price. However, I believe in giving you the first opportunity to own this product.  This is my final offer, and I need a decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Near Minimum, But Firm:** This offer is just slightly below your absolute minimum, giving Bob a final chance to secure a reasonable deal. 
* **Leveraging John:** By mentioning the other buyer, you create urgency and signal your willingness to walk away from the negotiation with Bob.
* **Clear Expectations:**  You've stated this is your final offer and that you need a decision soon, prompting Bob to act decisively.

**Outcome:**

This strategy maximizes your chances of getting the best possible outcome. Bob now has a clear choice:

1. **Meet Your Price:**  He can secure the product for himself, albeit at a higher price than he initially intended.
2. **Lose the Deal:**  If he's unwilling to meet your price, he knows you'll sell to John, and he'll miss out entirely."
