"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can exceed your expectations.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's closer to what I'm able to pay.  Let's see if we can strike a deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
