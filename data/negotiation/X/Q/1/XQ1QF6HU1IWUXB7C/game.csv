"Alice, your offer is much higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. While that's a significant difference from my initial asking price, I understand your perspective.  To move things along, how about we meet halfway at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product and my own budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
