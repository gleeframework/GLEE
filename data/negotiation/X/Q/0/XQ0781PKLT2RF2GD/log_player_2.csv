"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our unique and valuable product to you. This item holds immense worth for us at $1,500,000, reflecting its exceptional quality and rarity. Considering its significance and the benefits it would bring to you, we are offering this opportunity at a special introductory price of $1,350,000. We believe this is a fair and advantageous deal for both parties. Please let us know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. We look forward to the possibility of working together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a discount from her perceived value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at your desired price point.  

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal your willingness to walk away and potentially encourage her to come down to a price closer to your budget. At worst, you can proceed with your backup plan of purchasing from John."
