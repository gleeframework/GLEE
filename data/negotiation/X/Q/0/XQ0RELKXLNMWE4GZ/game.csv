"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair compromise that still gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my target price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $100 for the product. This is a fair price that meets both of our needs.",100.0,Alice,5,
