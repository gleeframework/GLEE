(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,020,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,000,000.  Considering there are only 3 rounds remaining, it is strategically advantageous for Bob to accept this offer. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's also a chance that negotiations might fail, forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price.  This offer is a good compromise, providing Bob with a significant discount compared to Alice's initial offer while also ensuring a deal is made."
