"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this happen!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's close this deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $110 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is a fair compromise. This allows you to get a good deal, and me to make a decent profit. Let's close this deal!",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $115. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $115 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $118. This is a small difference, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's close this deal!",118.0,Alice,7,
