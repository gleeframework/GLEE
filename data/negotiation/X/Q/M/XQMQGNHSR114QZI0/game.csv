"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. Can we meet in the middle at $19,000?",19000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $19,000 is still below what I had in mind. How about we settle at $19,500? This reflects the product's true value.",19500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's value, but $19,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $19,000 and $19,500, which would be $19,250. Can we discuss this further?",19250.0,Bob,4,
