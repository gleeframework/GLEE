Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $115 is still above what Bob is willing to pay, giving me some negotiating room.
* **It's below my minimum:** $115 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I make a profit.
* **It's friendly and open:** The message is inviting and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, I create an opportunity for a back-and-forth negotiation that could potentially lead to a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your product suggestion. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm confident that I can get a better price, especially since John is willing to pay $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $110? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm offering $110 to Bob. This counteroffer is:

* **Still above Bob's offer:**  It's a compromise that acknowledges his lower offer while remaining higher than his initial $100.
* **Closer to my desired price:**  It's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still leaves some room for further negotiation.
* **Reasonable and friendly:** It maintains a positive tone and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial price. 

This counteroffer should keep the negotiation going while demonstrating my willingness to be flexible and find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $105 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and while I could continue to negotiate with him, it's unlikely he'll go much higher.  I'd rather take the guaranteed $120 from John and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
