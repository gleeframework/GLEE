Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** Offering it at $119 leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's very interested, but still ensures you get close to your minimum.
* **Appeal to Value:** The message emphasizes a ""special price"" to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal."
