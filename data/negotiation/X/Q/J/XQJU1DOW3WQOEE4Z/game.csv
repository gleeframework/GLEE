"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $110. It's the lowest I can go without losing too much profit.",110.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're really close to making a decision, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $115. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",115.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're really close to making a decision, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $105. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $112. This is the lowest I can go without losing too much profit, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",112.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Unfortunately, I think I've reached my limit and will have to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $112 and my original offer of $90, which would be $101. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",101.0,Bob,10,
