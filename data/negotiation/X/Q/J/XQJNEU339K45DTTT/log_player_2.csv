Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1500000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1500000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1650000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value I mentioned earlier. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,650,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000.

Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $1550000. I'm still not quite ready to accept that price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1600000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I mentioned earlier. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,600,000 is still above your maximum budget.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice will be reluctant to drop below $1,600,000, especially since she's already lowered her offer.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,500,000, which is within your budget and guarantees a purchase."
