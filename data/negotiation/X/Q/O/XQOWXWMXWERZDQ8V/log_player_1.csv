"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my minimum price point. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay what the product is worth to me. If he isn't, I have other options, but I'll try to get my full value first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell the product for less than my minimum price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price closer to what the product is worth to me. $110 is a fair compromise, and I believe Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the offer.  I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm continuing to come down on my price, but I'm still holding firm on getting at least $100.  I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer, and it's likely that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've been going back and forth for a while, and it seems Bob is not willing to meet me halfway. I've already come down significantly from my initial price, and while $98 is tempting, I'm not sure we'll be able to reach a deal.  I'm going to go ahead and sell to John for $120. It's guaranteed money, and I don't want to risk losing more time and potentially getting an even lower price from Bob."
