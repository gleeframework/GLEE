"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to maximize your profit, but $900,000 is still a bit beyond my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about making a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $885,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. Let's see if we can shake on it at this price.",885000.0,Alice,5,
