**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer.  Let me know what you think.
