"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Based on my understanding of its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm open to discussing it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You can still get the product from John for your maximum budget, so there's no urgency to accept Alice's first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is quite a bit below its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. I believe this price reflects the value this product brings while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above your limit. While John is a safe bet at $800,000, there's still room to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better deal. Continuing to negotiate keeps the option open to acquire the product for less than $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.  Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $837,500. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $837,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a lower price, and I'm risking running out of rounds. It's safer and more efficient to purchase from John at $800,000 and ensure I get the product within my budget."
