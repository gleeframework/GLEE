"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer but $1,100,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $800,000 to me. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your initial offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",925000.0,Alice,5,
