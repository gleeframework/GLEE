Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $11,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, knowing she has a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, getting Alice closer to her desired profit.
* **Urgency:** The message subtly implies scarcity and a potential loss of opportunity for Bob if he doesn't act quickly."
