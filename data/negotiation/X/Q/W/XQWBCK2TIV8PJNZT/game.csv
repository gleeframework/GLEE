"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for your product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This would give you a good deal while also allowing me to get closer to my target price. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
