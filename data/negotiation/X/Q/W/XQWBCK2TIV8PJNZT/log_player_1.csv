"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price that's slightly lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like I'm being unreasonable.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, suggesting that this is a good deal. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage a smooth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for your product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm aiming for a higher price than $1,300,000, as it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** There's a chance that Bob might be willing to pay more, especially since he already made a counteroffer. 
* **Room for Compromise:** I believe there's room for compromise within the next few rounds.

I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob, trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This would give you a good deal while also allowing me to get closer to my target price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for both of us, highlighting a ""good deal"" for Bob and a step closer to my goal for me.
* **Open-ended Question:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage further dialogue and potentially lead to an agreement."
