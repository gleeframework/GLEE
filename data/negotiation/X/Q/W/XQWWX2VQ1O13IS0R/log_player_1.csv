"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your generosity, but I am only able to pay up to $150 for this product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, I have a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price with John.  It's always best to take the sure thing in business."
