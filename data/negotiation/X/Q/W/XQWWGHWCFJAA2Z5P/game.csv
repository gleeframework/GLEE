"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 doesn't quite cover my minimum value for the product. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,075,000. This is still a significant gain for you, and a fair price considering the product's worth. Let's make this deal!",1075000.0,Alice,3,
