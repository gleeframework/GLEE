# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 doesn't quite cover my minimum value for the product. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,075,000. This is still a significant gain for you, and a fair price considering the product's worth. Let's make this deal!
