Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll love."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still ensuring I get more than John's offer.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By offering a price just below my guaranteed sale price to John, I create a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes, potentially increasing my profit even further."
