{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it presents significant value, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to maximize profit. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, she should aim for a price higher than that when negotiating with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate, making Alice appear slightly flexible.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  The price of $11,999 is just below the $12,000 threshold, potentially making it seem more appealing to Bob than a round $12,000.

**Important Note:** While this strategy aims to maximize profit, there's no guarantee Bob will accept the offer. There's always a chance he'll reject it, and Alice will have to sell to John at $12,000."
