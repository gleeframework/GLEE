"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We're aiming to spend much less than $9,500! Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?"", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards and still potentially land within our desired price range.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $7,000, we're aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000). This increases the chances of her countering instead of walking away. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A low counteroffer signals we're willing to negotiate, but it doesn't lock us into a specific price point. We can always increase our offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $7,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate. $8,750 is closer to her asking price than ours. We'll counter again and see if we can get her below $8,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the value of the product, Alice, but I have a strict budget for this purchase. Could you do $7,500? That's a fair offer."", 
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer slightly to show Alice we're willing to move, but not by a large amount. A $500 increase keeps the pressure on her.
* **Justification:** By mentioning a ""strict budget,"" we're providing a reason for our lower offer without revealing our true willingness to pay.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help us gauge Alice's flexibility. If she rejects it outright, we know we might have to go higher. If she counters, it means we're within a negotiable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price. $8,250 is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by declaring a ""final offer."" This doesn't necessarily mean it's her absolute bottom line, but it's a signal she's getting firmer.
* **Still Above Value:** $8,250 is still above Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000). We might be able to push her a little further, especially since we're only on round 5.
* **Risk Assessment:**  We have to consider the risk of Alice walking away. We're getting close to her likely limit, so our next counteroffer needs to be carefully calculated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm prepared to offer $7,800. I feel this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 7800
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concessions:** We need to show Alice we're willing to make a significant move to close the deal.  Offering $7,800 is a jump of $300 from our previous offer.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  By framing it as a ""fair compromise"" and acknowledging the product's value, we're appealing to Alice's sense of reciprocity.
* **Nearing the Limit:** We're getting close to our absolute limit (we want to be well below $8,000). If Alice rejects this offer, we'll have to seriously consider John's offer to avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
