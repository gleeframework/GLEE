Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth $2,000,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product holds significant value for both you and Bob, starting with a price higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation.  
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""value and potential"" helps justify the high price.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, there's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer, leading you to sell to John at your minimum price."
