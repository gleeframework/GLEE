Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a small buffer for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 provides leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost. 

By setting the price at $14,000, Alice aims to capture a larger portion of the potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
