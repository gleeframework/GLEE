"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer because $6,000 is too low for me. I'm still confident I can get a better price, so I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. How about we split the difference and I come down to $7,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 7500}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,750

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, as I believe I can get a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $6,750 just doesn't work for me. Let's try $7,000. That's a fair compromise, and I'm really hoping we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Round 7
