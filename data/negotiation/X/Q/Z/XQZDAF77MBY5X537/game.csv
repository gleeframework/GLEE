,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. How about we split the difference and I come down to $7,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $7,500 is still a little steep for my budget.  How about $6,750?",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $6,750 just doesn't work for me. Let's try $7,000. That's a fair compromise, and I'm really hoping we can make this deal work.",7000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for understanding.  $7,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $6,800.  Would that be agreeable to you?",6800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $6,800 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $7,200, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's try to get this deal done.",7200.0,Alice,7,
