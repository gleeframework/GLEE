Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

$80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll sell it to you for $125? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $125 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I will reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer.  While John is a guaranteed sale, I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $90 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $110 is a bit steep. How about we meet at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum price, it is still below my $150 threshold.  I've already spent a lot of time negotiating with Bob, and  I don't want to risk getting a lower price than what John is offering. It's time to secure the guaranteed sale with John."
