"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll sell it to you for $125? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $125 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $90 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $110 is a bit steep. How about we meet at $95?",95.0,Bob,6,
