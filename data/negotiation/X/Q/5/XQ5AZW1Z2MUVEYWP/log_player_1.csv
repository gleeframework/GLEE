"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer that reflects the product's true value to you. This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a firm baseline.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""potential,""  we aim to pique Bob's interest and justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, providing ample space for negotiation and potential counteroffers. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping John's offer in mind, we won't go below $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is a significant jump, but it's still considerably lower than our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting this offer, we signal to Bob that we're serious about the product's value and willing to walk away if necessary.  This can encourage him to make a more substantial offer in the next round. 
* **John as Leverage:** We have the security of John's offer, giving us a strong position to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while still considering your budget constraints."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've made a significant concession of $50,000 to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Holding Firm:** However, we're still holding firm above the $1,000,000 mark, keeping us well within a reasonable range of our target price.
* **Justifying the Price:** By reiterating the product's value and acknowledging Bob's budget, we're aiming for a collaborative tone and a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Time Constraint:** As we progress through the rounds, the pressure to reach an agreement increases, potentially making Bob more willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still working within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Threshold:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is above our absolute minimum and represents a significant profit. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the potential gain is likely to be small compared to the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate capital that can be reinvested or utilized elsewhere.
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting Bob's offer at this point demonstrates a willingness to compromise and fosters goodwill for potential future dealings."
