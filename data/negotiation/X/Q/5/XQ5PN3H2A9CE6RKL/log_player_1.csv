Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, so I'm comfortable walking away if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is a good price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm dropping the price slightly to $1,350,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still believe the product is worth more than his offer.  Hopefully, this will entice him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,350,000,  $1,275,000 is a good price and significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  It's a good compromise and allows me to move forward with the sale."
