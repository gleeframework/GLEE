``` 

This initial offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum ($150), but not outrageously high. This allows room for negotiation and leaves the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I believe $150 would be a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $150 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $150 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $175.  This is a great deal for you, and it ensures I get a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, I would like to counter with $160 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer of $160 is only $10 less than my previous counteroffer. I'd rather sell to Bob than to John, who is only willing to pay my minimum."
