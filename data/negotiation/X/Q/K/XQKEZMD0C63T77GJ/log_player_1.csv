Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's truly unique and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $800,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still within range of what I'm hoping to get. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, hoping to close the deal on this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand we're getting closer, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $875,000 for the product.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, but I'm willing to throw in an additional $10000 if you can meet me at $860000. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close to my minimum and the extra $10,000 bonus is a good incentive. It's also getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds and having to settle for John's lower offer."
