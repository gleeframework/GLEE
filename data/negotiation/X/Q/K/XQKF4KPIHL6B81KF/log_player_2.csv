"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $10,000, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still likely higher than her minimum acceptable price.  This allows room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still lower than your maximum price of $12,000 and also lower than your previous counteroffer of $9,000.  Accepting this offer saves you money compared to buying from John, and it's likely the best deal you're going to get from Alice."
