"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product but would need to pay closer to $80. Would you be willing to consider that price?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that 150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 110? It's a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll love it.",110.0,Alice,3,
