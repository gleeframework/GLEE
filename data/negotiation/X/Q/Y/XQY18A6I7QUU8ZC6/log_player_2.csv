"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal, it's still above his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget.  How about $10,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and would allow me to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum limit. He can still try to negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice has shown some willingness to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a little high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750.  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for you too."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $11250, which is a fair compromise and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While there are still rounds left, there's a risk that further negotiation will not result in a lower price that Bob is comfortable with.  It's better to secure the product from John for his maximum budget and avoid further potential negotiation headaches."
