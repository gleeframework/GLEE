Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you have a hard bottom line, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,020,000 for the product. I think this is the highest I can go and still make a profit. I hope we can find a middle ground.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is highly unlikely to move significantly from his $1,020,000 offer.  He's consistently stayed below my lowest acceptable price, and at this point, the potential profit isn't worth the risk of him walking away in later rounds. Selling to John guarantees the full $1,200,000 value and avoids further negotiation."
