"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for this product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll see its worth once you start using it.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart. While I appreciate the features you've highlighted, I'm unable to justify going above $7,000 for this product.  Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your hesitation, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  $7,000 is too low, however, I'm willing to make a significant move to close this deal. Would you consider $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're coming down, but that's still more than I'm willing to spend.  How about we try $9,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,6,
