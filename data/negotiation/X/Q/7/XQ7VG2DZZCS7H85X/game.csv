"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my original price.  How about $1,250,000?  This gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would that price point be feasible for you?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000 as a final offer. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you.  Let me know your final decision.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
