"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's a great value.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $850,000 is still higher than I'd like to go. Let's make this simple: I'll offer you $750,000. Take it or leave it.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you a price of $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can go up to $775,000, but that's my absolute limit. This gives us both a fair deal.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'll make one more concession and offer you a price of $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,7,
