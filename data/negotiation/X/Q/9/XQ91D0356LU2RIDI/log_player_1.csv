Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,150,000:**  This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't immediately settle for the minimum.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation.  It highlights the product's value to him to encourage acceptance. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a good price:**  The initial offer is high, but it allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential counteroffers.
* **Encourage a negotiation:** By leaving room for compromise, I increase the chances of a successful deal.
* **Maintain a backup option:** The knowledge of John's offer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing the product, but I would like to propose a price of $1050000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's above my minimum of $1,000,000, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this stage.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price with Bob.  He's clearly interested in the product, so there's potential for a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation. This shows him that I'm serious about getting a fair price.

The next step will be to send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still be a great deal for you and allow me to achieve a more reasonable price. Let me know if you're open to this compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $1,150,000 and Bob's offer of $1,050,000.
* **Message:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a compromise, emphasizing the ""great deal"" it offers Bob while still allowing me to reach a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm not asking for my original price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 

By offering this counteroffer, I aim to:

* **Maintain a positive negotiation:** The compromise tone of the message keeps the conversation friendly and collaborative.
* **Secure a better price:** While lower than my initial offer, $1,100,000 is still well above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Show a willingness to reach agreement:** The counteroffer indicates that I'm open to finding a middle ground."
