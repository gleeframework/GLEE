# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value and the impact it could have on your operations, I propose a price of $12,000 for this exceptional item. This offer is designed to provide you with significant savings while ensuring you receive the highest quality product available. Please let me know if you require any additional information or have questions about the product. I look forward to the opportunity to serve your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than her product's value to her, you know you can get a better deal from John. Buying from John at $10,000 saves you $2,000 and meets your goal of spending no more than $10,000."
