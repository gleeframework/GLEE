"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's more than your maximum budget and more importantly, higher than what John offers. You can save a significant amount of money ($350,000) by going with John."
