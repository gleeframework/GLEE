"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer but not as good as it could be.**  You can get the product for $75,000 less by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John. 
* **You have room to negotiate with Alice.**  You can try to counteroffer and see if you can get the price lower. 
* **The goal is to save as much money as possible.**  While Alice's offer is tempting, it's not the absolute best deal."
