"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160, which is a very fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you value the product at. It makes sense to negotiate further or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I have a limited budget. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This leaves room for bargaining.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone helps keep the negotiation positive.
* **Justification:** By mentioning a limited budget, you provide Alice with a reason to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $60 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice came down a bit, but $140 is still significantly higher than your $80 maximum and your initial offer of $60. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  It seems like Alice is open to negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a more substantial price reduction. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** Keep in mind that you can always fall back on John's offer of $80 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't lead to a favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still quite a ways off from that price point.  Would you be willing to consider something closer to $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:**  Moving from $60 to $70 is a substantial increase in your offer, showing Alice that you're serious about purchasing the product.
* **Staying Below Budget:** This offer keeps you well below your $80 maximum.
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:**  This counteroffer will help you gauge how much further Alice is willing to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. How about we split the difference and settle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $105 is better than her previous offers, but it's still significantly above your $80 maximum. 
* **Slow Progress:** Alice is coming down in price, but very slowly.  You need to signal that a larger concession is necessary to make a deal worthwhile.
* **John's Offer as a Strong Alternative:**  The difference between Alice's current offer and John's offer is substantial.  You're likely better off getting closer to John's price or simply buying from him."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $105 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be honest, I've seen similar products in the $80 range.  If you can get closer to that price, I'm ready to make a deal.  Otherwise, I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This counteroffer sets a clear boundary by stating your maximum budget ($80) while maintaining a polite and respectful tone.
* **Introducing Competition:**  Mentioning that you've seen similar products at lower prices subtly introduces the idea of competition, encouraging Alice to be more flexible.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By implying you might explore other options, you encourage Alice to take your offer more seriously and potentially close the deal quickly. 
* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer could be seen as your ""final offer,"" putting the ball firmly in Alice's court."
