"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think you'll find it's worth every penny of my asking price of $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking for something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is offering the maximum he's willing to pay, which is still below my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in further negotiation. Accepting John's offer ensures I get my desired price without wasting time on a negotiation that's unlikely to yield a better outcome."
