Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer, giving you a negotiating advantage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high without pushing Bob away. Offering a price closer to his valuation increases your profit but also raises the risk of rejection.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a rare opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,350,000 is significantly above your minimum and leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal (saving $150,000 from his perceived value).
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exceptional product,"" ""unique value,"" and ""rare opportunity"" enhance the product's perceived worth. 
* **No Mention of John:**  Keep your backup option secret to maintain negotiating strength.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You could adjust the price slightly up or down depending on your risk tolerance and how aggressively you want to negotiate."
