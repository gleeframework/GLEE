"Bob,  I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, $1,350,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,550,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. I genuinely believe this product can be a great asset to your business, and I hope we can find a way to make this work.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
