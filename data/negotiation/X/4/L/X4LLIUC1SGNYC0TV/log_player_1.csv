Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, $1,350,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.
