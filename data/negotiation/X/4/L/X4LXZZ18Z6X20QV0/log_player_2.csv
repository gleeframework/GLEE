Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a fair price. In light of your latest offer, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This price respects both the value of the product and your budget considerations.

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $9,500.  It makes more sense to buy from John for $10,000 and avoid further negotiation rounds."
