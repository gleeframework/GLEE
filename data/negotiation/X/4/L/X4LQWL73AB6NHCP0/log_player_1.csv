"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you.  I'm asking $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I still believe the product is worth more. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is close to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth a bit more. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer!  $10,500 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,600.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $10,400? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I am starting to run out of rounds.  The risk is that if I continue to negotiate with Bob, I might end up with a lower price than I would get from John.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000."
