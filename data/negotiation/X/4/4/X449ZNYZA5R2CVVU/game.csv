"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is unfortunately below what I can accept for this product.  It's a very unique piece, and I believe its value is closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $13000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think you'd be very happy with the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
