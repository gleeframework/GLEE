"I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I'm not able to go as low as $1,100,000.  This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be worth more to you in the long run. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which reflects the true worth of the product while still giving you a good deal.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand we're both trying to find a good deal here. However, I need to stick to my minimum price of $1,200,000 for this product. It's truly unique and holds great value.
