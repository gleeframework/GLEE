"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $12000?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13000?  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's make this work.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $12000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12500? That way we both get a good deal and can move forward.",12500.0,Bob,4,
