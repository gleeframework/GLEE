Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it's worth at least $100, but I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** You know you have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, so you shouldn't offer Bob any less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $100 to Bob. 
* **Aiming Higher:**  Starting with an offer of $120 allows you to potentially earn more than your minimum. It gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still staying above your fallback price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
