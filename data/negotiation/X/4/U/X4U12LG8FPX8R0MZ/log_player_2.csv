"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I make it available to others. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This gives you a significant advantage while still reflecting the worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is under your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal."
