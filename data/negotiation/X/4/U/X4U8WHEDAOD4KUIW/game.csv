"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,150,000. This price still provides me with a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
