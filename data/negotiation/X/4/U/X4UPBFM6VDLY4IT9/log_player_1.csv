Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, the $950,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $950,000 represents a fair valuation for the product. I would like to stick to this figure as it aligns with my financial constraints. However, if you're unable to meet this price, I will consider purchasing the product from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Bob is clearly holding firm at a price point significantly below what John is willing to pay.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap, and risking Bob going to John for $800,000 would be a costly mistake. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best outcome."
