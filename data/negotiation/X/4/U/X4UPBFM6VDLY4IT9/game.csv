"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, the $950,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm confident it can bring significant returns for your business.  Would you consider $1,150,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $950,000 represents a fair valuation for the product. I would like to stick to this figure as it aligns with my financial constraints. However, if you're unable to meet this price, I will consider purchasing the product from John for $800,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
