"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $14,000 is lower than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation.  You can try to get a better price from Alice since you know John offers it for $15,000."
