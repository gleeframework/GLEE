Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering it at $15,000 might seem too opportunistic and could make Bob hesitant.
* **Secure a Deal:** Offering a price that's significantly more attractive than John's offer ($12,000) increases the likelihood of Bob accepting."
