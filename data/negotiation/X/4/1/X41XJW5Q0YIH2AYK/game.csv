"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I believe the product holds significant value, I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $825,000. Is this a more comfortable price for you?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle on $760,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering $815,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm still open to negotiations.",815000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me closer to my price, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting the best possible price for the product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a bit more. I'm now offering $820,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",820000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. You say this is your final offer, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. Would you consider meeting in the middle at $800,000? This would be a fair resolution for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,8,

"I think we've been dancing around this price for a while, Bob. I'm not willing to meet you at $800,000, but I'm willing to make one final push to see if we can get closer to my target. I'm now offering $825,000, but I'm not budging beyond that. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",825000.0,Alice,9,
