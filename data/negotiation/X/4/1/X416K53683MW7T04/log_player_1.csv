Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value is $100. It leaves room for negotiation while still being a good price for me. I'll see what Bob's response is and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my ideal price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $135. It's a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $125 is a good deal. It's above my minimum value, and  I'm not sure I can get a better offer from Bob. It's also a significant improvement over selling to John for $100."
