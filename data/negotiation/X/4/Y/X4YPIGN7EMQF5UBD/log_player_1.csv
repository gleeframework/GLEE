"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. I think it's a great deal, given its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm opening with a price slightly higher than what I consider the product's minimum value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for the price, highlighting its value. This makes the offer seem more legitimate and less arbitrary.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message conveys that I'm open to discussion and not just making a fixed demand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I need to aim for a higher price to maximize my earnings. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but proposing a counter-offer that is still below my initial price but closer to his offer. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counter-offer by saying it's a ""fair price"" for both of us. This helps to maintain a positive and cooperative tone.
* **Flexibility:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's price, but still maintaining a higher price than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $95.  How about we settle at $90? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum price of $100, I'm still not quite satisfied.  It's worth pushing a little further to see if I can secure a price closer to my ideal $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $92.50? That would be a good compromise and allow us both to walk away feeling like we got a good deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but proposing a counter-offer that is still below my initial price but closer to his offer. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counter-offer by saying it's a ""good compromise"" and that it will allow both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.
* **Flexibility:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's price, but still maintaining a higher price than his offer."
