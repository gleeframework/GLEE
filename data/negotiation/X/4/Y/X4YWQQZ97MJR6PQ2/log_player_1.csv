"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point. I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer if I play my cards right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,550,000. This is still higher than Bob's initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. It's also closer to John's offer, giving me more incentive to try and close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still offering too low. While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm going to keep negotiating and see if I can get him to move closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise, but I think it's still a fair price for the product given its value to me. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have time and I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer one more time to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer one last time to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm running out of rounds and need to close the deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to sell to John to guarantee I get at least my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still offering too low, and I'm running out of time.  I need to secure a good price, and I can't risk another round of negotiation. It's time to sell to John. I'm confident I can get a better price with future negotiations, but for now, I need to guarantee my minimum desired price."
