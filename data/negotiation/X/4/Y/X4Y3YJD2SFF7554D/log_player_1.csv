"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm confident in the product's value and am not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering $11,000 in this round. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer.  It shows flexibility while still pushing for a price closer to what I believe the product is worth. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $9,800, it's still below my minimum value and I'm not desperate for a sale. I believe I can still get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

I'm counter-offering with $10,750.  It's a significant drop from my last offer, but it's still above my minimum value and shows flexibility. I hope this will be a compromise Bob is willing to accept, as we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting close to the end of the rounds, and Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum value.  I'm willing to take the $10,000 from John rather than continue negotiating with Bob.  It's not my ideal price, but it's a guarantee and I don't want to risk losing out completely."
