Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for us to negotiate. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so $10,000 gives him a reason to consider it.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You value the product at $12,000, leaving room for negotiation and potential compromise. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, you can:

* **Set a strong initial position:** It shows you are confident in the value of your product. 
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he accepts quickly, it shows he's really interested. If he counters, you can gauge his negotiating style and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $7,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial value of $8,000, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my minimum but still appealing to him.  I'll aim for a compromise that makes both of us feel like we've gotten a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial offer of $10,000, showing flexibility. 
* **Still within my range:**  $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, so it's a good deal for me.
* **Appeal to Bob:** The message emphasizes the benefit for Bob, highlighting that it's still a great deal for him.

By making a counteroffer that is a reasonable compromise, I'm hoping to reach an agreement quickly without having to go through multiple rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $6500. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,500 is far too low for me. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and significantly less than the value I place on the product.  While I appreciate Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate, continuing to haggle with him risks wasting time and potentially ending up with a price I'm not satisfied with.

**Selling to John is the best option:**

By selling to John, I can get my desired price of $12,000, ensuring I receive the full value of my product.  This is the most financially beneficial decision for me in this situation."
