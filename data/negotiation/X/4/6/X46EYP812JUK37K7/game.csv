"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe it's a fair price considering its exceptional quality and potential benefits. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still interested in finding a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to meet you at $1100000. This is a compromise that balances our interests, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1100000 is still not within my budget. I'm starting to think about other options, but I'm willing to give you one last chance. I can go up to $950000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to give me one last chance. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a price that still allows me to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
