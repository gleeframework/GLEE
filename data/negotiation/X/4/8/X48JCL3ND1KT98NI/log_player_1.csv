"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to my ideal.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust accordingly.  I have John as a backup, but I'd prefer to maximize my profit with Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I still believe I can do better.  I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the value of the product. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is close enough to my desired price range.  I've only got 6 rounds left before I have to make a decision, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal.  It's better to accept this offer than to risk having to settle for John's $1,000,000 offer."
