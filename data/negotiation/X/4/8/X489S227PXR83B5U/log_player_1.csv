Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me some room to negotiate. If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $140 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try to get a better price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $155. This is still a bit higher than what he's willing to pay, but it's closer to my minimum price of $150. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's higher than what John is offering and closer to my minimum.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate will only prolong the process and I might end up getting a lower price or losing the sale altogether."
