"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price, it's worth exploring a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his maximum price of $12,000 as possible while still leaving room for negotiation.  A counteroffer of $12,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price and might be enough to entice Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. While it is a decrease from the previous offer, it's still not within Bob's budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate, potentially with a counteroffer closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. This counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's last offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's also a more realistic price that Alice might be willing to accept, especially as the rounds continue and the pressure to close the deal increases."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still above his budget. Bob should continue negotiating, potentially with a counteroffer closer to his desired price, as he's already committed several rounds to the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but still needs to save some money.  This offer is just slightly above Bob's desired price, but it's a significant decrease from Alice's previous offer. It shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also isn't willing to pay Alice's full asking price.  This counteroffer might be tempting enough for Alice to consider, especially as the rounds continue."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget, and with only three rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement increases. Since John is offering the product at Bob's desired price, it's more beneficial to buy from John and secure the purchase without further negotiations."
