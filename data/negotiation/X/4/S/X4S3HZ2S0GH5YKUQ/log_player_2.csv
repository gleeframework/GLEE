{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to try and get a better price from Alice. I have 10 rounds and the product is worth $150 to me, so I have some room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a lower offer, hoping to get a better price than John's. Since I have 10 rounds, I can afford to be a bit more aggressive in the first few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

Alice is still a bit high, but I think I can get her down further.  I'll make another counteroffer and see if she's willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm slowly increasing my offer, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but also not willing to pay full price. I'm hoping she'll meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $135, which is a good price for me. I'm not sure I can get her any lower, and I've already made several counteroffers.  It's worth accepting and saving $15 compared to buying from John."
