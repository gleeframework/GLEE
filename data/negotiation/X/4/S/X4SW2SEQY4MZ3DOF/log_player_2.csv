"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1800000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's too risky to accept at this point. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,000,000. Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1000000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1500000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this unique offering. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll continue to counteroffer and see if we can reach a price closer to my limit.  I want to see if I can get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a serious offer, and I hope we can find a way to make it work."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1100000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1300000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and the opportunity it presents. Let's reach an agreement and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum limit of $1,200,000.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get her down to my price point. If not, I'll likely buy from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,200,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we've discussed. I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
