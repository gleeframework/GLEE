"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low for me, and I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 is low, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to what I want, I still believe the product is worth more. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,125. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10125}
