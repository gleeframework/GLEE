Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $13,000, which is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  It's likely Bob will counteroffer, and I want to have room to negotiate downwards while still making a decent profit.
* **Knowing my fallback:** I'm aware of my fallback option with John for $10,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the price goes too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price. 
* **Negotiation is key:**  I believe I can push Bob higher with a counteroffer. It's worth continuing the negotiation.
* **My goal is to maximize profit:** Selling to John is my fallback, but I'm motivated to get closer to the $15,000 value the product holds for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10,500 is a good start, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? That way, we can both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Remaining firm on value:** I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, reflecting the product's true value.
* **Clear and concise message:** My message is direct and clear, demonstrating professionalism and a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice.  How about $11,000?  That's a significant step from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is significantly closer to my initial offer and the product's worth to him. It's a reasonable compromise.
* **Minimizing risk:** While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk of Bob walking away completely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on, and John is always a potential buyer if I don't reach a deal with Bob."
