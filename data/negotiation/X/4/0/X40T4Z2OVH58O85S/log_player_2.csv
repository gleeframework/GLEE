"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. How about a price of $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice. Bob can potentially save more money by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $110 is a good starting point, I'd be willing to pay $95.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $105?  It's a fair compromise, I believe. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $105 is within Bob's budget of $120.**
* **It's a good compromise, as Bob has already successfully negotiated down from $110.**
* **Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk of Alice rejecting the offer and pushing the price back up.**
* **Buying from John at $120 would be more expensive.** 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer of $105 is the best option to ensure Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
