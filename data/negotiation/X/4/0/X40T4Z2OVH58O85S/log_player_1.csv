Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $110 is a good starting point, I'd be willing to pay $95.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
