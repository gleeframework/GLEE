Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $130. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price, but hopefully, Bob will be willing to pay it as the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer of $110. While it's better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $115. This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's.  Hopefully, it's attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. 

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. John is a sure bet for $120, which is my minimum threshold.  It's not ideal, but it's a safe and predictable outcome."
