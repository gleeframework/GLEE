Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is lower than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for room for negotiation, but also ensures that I am not leaving too much money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still far below my desired price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm increasing Bob's offer by $1,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeping the price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not worth the risk of another round of negotiation. Selling to John guarantees me a profit, and given the time and effort invested in negotiation, it's the most sensible choice at this point."
