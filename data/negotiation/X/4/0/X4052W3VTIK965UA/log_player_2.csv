Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your target, Bob, but I still think I can do better. I can meet you at $82, which is just a few dollars above our last offer. It's a fair compromise, don't you think?

While Alice is getting closer to a price I'd find acceptable, it's still above my limit. I can get the product for a guaranteed $80 from John, so it makes more sense to go with that option."
