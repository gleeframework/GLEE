"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product. I'm confident it's worth it to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our needs and allows us to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $950,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $1,025,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $975,000 for the product.  This is a solid compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let's see if we can finalize this.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,000,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $985,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen.",985000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a small concession to meet you in the middle. I'll meet you at $995,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",995000.0,Alice,9,
