``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my desired outcome, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the value to Bob, making it a compelling offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm open to negotiation, showing I'm willing to find a mutually agreeable solution.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8200. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $8000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Low:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's room for negotiation and that I can likely get closer to my desired price.
* **Opportunity to Improve the Offer:**  By rejecting the counteroffer, I can make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me, potentially increasing my earnings.

**Next Steps:**

I will analyze Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $9,000, trying to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to be closer to my initial price. How about $9,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $9,500 to $9,000. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still being within my acceptable range.
* **Value Emphasis:** I continue to highlight the value Bob will receive from the product, reinforcing his motivation to close the deal.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By offering $9,000, I'm aiming for a price that's closer to the midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This creates a more balanced negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8200 and $9000, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8600. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $8,600 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better price by rejecting this offer.
* **Negotiation Advantage:** By rejecting, I maintain the upper hand in the negotiation and can push for a more favorable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than $9,000, aiming to find a middle ground that's closer to my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,600 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be closer to $9,000.  Let's try $8,800.  This is a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 8800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my offer slightly from $9,000 to $8,800. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still staying within my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the value Bob will receive from the product, reminding him of the potential benefits and encouraging him to agree.
* **Closing the Gap:** By offering $8,800, I'm aiming for a price that's closer to the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This creates a more balanced negotiation and increases the likelihood of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8800. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8400. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us, and I think this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, and I'm not satisfied with the progress. 
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still potential to get a higher price by continuing the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $8,700, attempting to find a compromise that's closer to my target price while still acknowledging Bob's budget constraints."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find the right price.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,400 is still a bit too low.  How about we meet in the middle again at $8,700?  It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's try to close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8700} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:**  I'm again proposing a price that's closer to the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to find common ground.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly emphasizing the need to close the deal, reminding Bob that time is running out.
* **Fairness:** I reiterate that my offer is fair to both of us, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8500. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $8,500 is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price, it's the best offer Bob has made so far. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's a risk that Bob could become less willing to negotiate further. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** Accepting this offer will allow me to avoid the risk of selling to John for a lower price, especially since the price is only slightly below my desired range. 

**Next Steps:**

While I would have preferred a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and prevents the potential loss of earning any money at all if I were to reject the offer and fail to reach a deal in the remaining rounds."
