Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're leaving yourself room to negotiate and still make a substantial profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob has a strong incentive to negotiate, knowing he'll get a good deal if he can bring the price down. 
* **It keeps the door open to John:**  If Bob rejects your offer, you can still fall back on the $1,000,000 deal with John.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is still a good profit, it's not quite where I want to be. I'll counteroffer and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly, meeting Bob halfway. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a strong price.  We're getting closer to a deal, and it's important to see if this offer is enough to convince Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is still a significant profit, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer again, but this time, I'll be more aggressive in trying to reach a price that's closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

This time, I'm only dropping the price by $50,000. I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm not willing to go much lower. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
