"Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. While I appreciate its uniqueness, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Let me see what I can do. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. Let me see what I can do. I'm willing to take another small step down to $10,200. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,600?",9600.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I like the idea of splitting the difference, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $9,600, which would be $9,900. What do you think?",9900.0,Alice,7,
