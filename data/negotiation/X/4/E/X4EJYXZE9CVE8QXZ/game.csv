"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a perfect fit for you. It's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident it will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price slightly above my minimum threshold. Would you be interested in acquiring it for $810,000? This gives us both a good deal, and ensures I can provide you with excellent support after the purchase.",810000.0,Alice,1,
