"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than my minimum but still higher than Bob's perceived value. This allows for room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit.  I'm confident I can reach a compromise before needing to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum of $15,000. I'm going to reject his counteroffer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come up a bit. I'm still aiming for a profit that's closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better offer. It's not worth settling for less when I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm raising the price again, showing that I'm willing to compromise but also that I value the product. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price considering his previous offers."
