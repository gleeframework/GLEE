"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my original offer.  How about $850,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it would be fair to me as well. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
