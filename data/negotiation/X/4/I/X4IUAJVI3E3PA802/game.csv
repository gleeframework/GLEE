,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy now.",100.0,Bob,4,
