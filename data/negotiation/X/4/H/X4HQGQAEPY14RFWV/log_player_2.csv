"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I understand it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
