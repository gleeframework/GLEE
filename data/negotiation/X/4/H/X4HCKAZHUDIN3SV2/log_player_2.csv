"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15000 to you. Let's close this deal quickly! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better. He knows the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, and he has room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $9,500. This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer starts lower than Alice's initial price, showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal.
* **Fairness:**  $9,500 is still a decent profit for Alice, considering her own valuation of $8,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to Bob's target without feeling pressured."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is still a great price for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:**  While $10,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still get a lower price. He's aiming for a price closer to $9,500, which is within the range of what both parties could find agreeable.
* **Avoiding a Quick Deal:** Accepting this offer would result in a decent deal for Bob, but not the best possible one. He's better off continuing to negotiate and pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference at $10,000? This would allow both of us to walk away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to compromise, but it's still closer to his preferred price point.
* **""Split the Difference"":** This common negotiating tactic can make the offer seem fair to Alice, as it acknowledges her previous offer and presents a middle ground.
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer puts pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal to another seller."
