"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This would still be a good deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let's see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Alice, but $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $9,000? That's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
