"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to get a good deal, so starting with a price significantly lower than our maximum ($120) and Alice's initial offer ($100) gives us room to negotiate.
* **Polite but Firm:** We are expressing our interest while making it clear that the initial price is not acceptable to us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference at $85?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, which is a good sign.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $85 is still significantly higher than our ideal price and above her value. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $78? It's a fair price that's closer to what I had in mind."",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concessions:** We are making smaller concessions now to show we are getting closer to our limit.  
* **Targeting Above Her Value:** We know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so aiming slightly below that might be our sweet spot for a deal.
* **Justifying the Offer:** Providing a reason for the counteroffer (""fair price"") can make it more convincing."
