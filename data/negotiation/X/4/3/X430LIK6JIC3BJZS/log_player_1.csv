Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer. 
* **Prepared to walk away:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $120 gives me the flexibility to walk away if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I can likely get a better price from Bob by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **John is a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $120 gives me leverage to negotiate with Bob without feeling pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest,  $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  $85 is a middle ground between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $65.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  The message emphasizes ""fair deal"" to make Bob feel like he's getting a good price.
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you be willing to go down to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Another counteroffer:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer.
* **John's offer provides flexibility:** John's offer of $120 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob without feeling pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you have a budget. While $75 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference at $80?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  $80 is a final compromise offer that's closer to Bob's offer while still exceeding my minimum.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  The message highlights ""fair price for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise.
* **Confidence in the product:** Mentioning that Bob ""won't regret it"" reinforces the value of the product.

**Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell the product to John for $120.  I'm confident that $80 is a good enough price for Bob, but I'm not willing to go lower."
