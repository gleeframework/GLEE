"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it really useful. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more like $105. Can you meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit more, but how about $110? That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the lowest I can go.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $108 is still below my minimum. I'm going to have to stick with my last offer of $110. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,5,
