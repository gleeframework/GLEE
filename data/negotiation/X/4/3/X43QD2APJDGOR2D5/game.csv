"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $850,000 is a tempting offer, I'm confident this product holds significantly more value for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This reflects its true potential while still offering you a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $900,000, so I'll offer $875,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference again â€“ how about $887,500?  This recognizes its value while acknowledging your perspective.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $887,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but I'd like to propose an alternative: how about we meet at $882,500? This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget.",882500.0,Bob,6,
