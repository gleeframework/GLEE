Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $900,000, so I'll offer $875,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference again â€“ how about $887,500?  This recognizes its value while acknowledging your perspective."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $887,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but I'd like to propose an alternative: how about we meet at $882,500? This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  $882,500 is a solid profit, and continuing to negotiate might yield smaller gains while risking the deal altogether. It's better to secure a good offer now than risk getting bogged down in a protracted negotiation."
