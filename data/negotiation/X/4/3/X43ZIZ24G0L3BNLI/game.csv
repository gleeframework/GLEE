"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $6,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the compromise, Alice.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're getting closer to the price I'm willing to accept. However, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $7,800. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit.",7800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm ready to close this deal today, but I need it to work for me.  Would you consider $7,200? If not, I think I'll have to go with a different seller.",7200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your honesty. However, $7,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $7,500. This is the final price I can accept, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",7500.0,Alice,7,
