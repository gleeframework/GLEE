Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've stated and my own assessment. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

This price reflects a fair compromise, considering the potential of the product and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
