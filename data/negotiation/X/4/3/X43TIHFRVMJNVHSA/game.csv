"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've stated and my own assessment. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,200,000. This is my best offer and reflects the immense value this product holds for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still outside of my comfortable price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, considering the potential of the product and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
