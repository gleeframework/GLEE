"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go down to $120 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $170? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is your limit, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to compromise, though! How about we meet at $160? It's still a good deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,5,
