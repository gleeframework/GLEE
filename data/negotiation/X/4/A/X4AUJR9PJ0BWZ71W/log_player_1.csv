Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,000,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Next Steps:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer myself. If things stall, I'll always have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about I offer you $950,000 for the product? This still allows you to gain a significant profit while saving you some money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum value, but it's still below what I want. 
* I'm going to try and get closer to my target by making a counteroffer.
* I'm not going to sell to John yet because I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $975,000 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still striving for a higher price.
* **Message:** The message is still friendly, acknowledging Bob's offer while making it clear I'm looking for a slightly higher price. It also emphasizes the ""fair compromise"" aspect, making it more appealing for Bob. 
* **Next Steps:** I'm confident that Bob will likely accept this offer, as it's closer to his desired price and still represents a good deal for him.  However, I'm ready to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I'd like to keep the price lower, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, how about we aim for $960,000? This still gives you a good profit margin while being closer to what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  $960,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I'd love to get closer to my target of $1,000,000,  I risk further negotiation and potentially losing Bob as a buyer. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate could also mean losing out on the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. 
* **Profit:**  $960,000 still represents a good profit for me, especially considering the potential time and effort involved in further negotiation.

Therefore, it's more strategic to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale that is close to my minimum value."
