"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about I offer you $950,000 for the product? This still allows you to gain a significant profit while saving you some money.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I'd like to keep the price lower, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, how about we aim for $960,000?
