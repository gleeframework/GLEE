Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This reflects the value to me and leaves room for us both to make a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm going to counter with $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to me while still providing a healthy profit for you. Let's see if we can make this happen.
