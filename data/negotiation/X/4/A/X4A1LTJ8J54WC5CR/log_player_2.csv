"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still too high. Since you have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John, there's room to negotiate a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This reflects the value to me and leaves room for us both to make a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is still a good value for you, and I'm willing to work with you to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still too high.  There is still room to negotiate and you can likely get a better price with a counteroffer. You have 7 rounds left, so you can continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm going to counter with $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to me while still providing a healthy profit for you. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for both of us. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to your target. You've already made several counteroffers and you only have 5 rounds remaining.  It's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating and you could end up paying more if you run out of rounds and have to buy from John.  Accepting this offer is the best course of action to secure the product at a reasonable price."
