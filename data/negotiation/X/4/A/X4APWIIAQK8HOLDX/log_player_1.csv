To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. This takes into account the unique benefits it offers and its potential for a strong return on your investment.  What are your thoughts?"",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but my maximum is $850,000.  I believe this price is still fair considering the potential value it brings.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I've tried to find a price that works for both of us, but $850,000 falls significantly short of its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  I'm open to negotiating further, so I'm proposing $1,050,000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial asking price and reflects my willingness to find common ground."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, we're still a ways off from a price that reflects the value of this product.  To be candid, I have another potential buyer I could go to, but I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I think that's you.  My final offer is $1,000,000.  This is a firm price, and I believe it's more than fair."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a significant amount for me, and I'm confident that we can close the deal at this price.  It's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to move much further from his $975,000 offer.  While we could continue negotiating, the potential gains are shrinking, and we risk losing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit."
