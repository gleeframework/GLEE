"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. This takes into account the unique benefits it offers and its potential for a strong return on your investment.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're willing to pay up to $800,000, and Alice is starting at $1,100,000. It's much better to start negotiating and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but my maximum is $850,000.  I believe this price is still fair considering the potential value it brings.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I've tried to find a price that works for both of us, but $850,000 falls significantly short of its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  I'm open to negotiating further, so I'm proposing $1,050,000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial asking price and reflects my willingness to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, even with the ""substantial discount"". While it's getting closer to your budget, you can still try to negotiate further. It's better to risk a few more rounds of negotiation than to accept a price that's still significantly above your maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, we're still a ways off from a price that reflects the value of this product.  To be candid, I have another potential buyer I could go to, but I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I think that's you.  My final offer is $1,000,000.  This is a firm price, and I believe it's more than fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. While she claims it's her ""final offer"" and mentions another buyer, it's worth pushing a bit further. There's still room for negotiation, and it's better to try to get a better price than to accept a deal that's still uncomfortable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a significant amount for me, and I'm confident that we can close the deal at this price.  It's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
