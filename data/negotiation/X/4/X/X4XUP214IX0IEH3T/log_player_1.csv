Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and represents a significant return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, meaning he'd theoretically be willing to pay anything up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so any offer below that is unacceptable.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming high initially is strategic.  A price of $925,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit above your minimum. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair reflection"" to make the offer more appealing and less arbitrary."
