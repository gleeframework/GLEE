"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd be willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you meet me there?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $115. I'll try to find a middle ground again. How about I offer it to you for $130? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $130 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $118. Can you consider that?",118.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more offer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. How about I offer it to you for $125? It's a bit higher than your latest offer, but I think it's still a good compromise.",125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I want to keep negotiating, but I'll make one more offer. How about $122? That's the closest I'm willing to go.",122.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not willing to go any higher, Bob. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to find a compromise. How about I offer it to you for $123? It's still a bit higher than your latest offer, but I think it's worth considering.",123.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really not willing to go any higher than $122. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. How about we meet at $122?",122.0,Bob,10,
