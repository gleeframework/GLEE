Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($19,000 vs. $10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value is higher than Bob's estimate, potentially influencing his perception. 
* **Alternative:** I know I have John as a backup who will buy the product at my minimum price, giving me leverage in the negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  While I'm aiming high, it's crucial to be prepared to negotiate. If Bob outright rejects this initial offer, I might need to lower the price slightly to entice him while still aiming for a price above my minimum."
