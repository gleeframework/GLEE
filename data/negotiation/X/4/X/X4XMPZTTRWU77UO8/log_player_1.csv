Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more than his perceived value of $10,000. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting with a higher offer ($19,000) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Maintain Positive Relationship:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing value rather than just stating a price. This can help keep the interaction pleasant even if Bob declines.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves risk. If Bob rejects the offer, you'll miss out on the potential profit above $15,000. However, it aims to maximize your potential gain."
