Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While Bob values the product at $100, it's best to start with an offer higher than his perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation or acceptance if he sees additional value.
* **Above Bob, Below John:** The price of $125 is strategically placed. It's more profitable than selling to John ($150) but still potentially attractive to Bob if he's willing to pay a premium.
* **Positive Framing:** The message uses positive language (""special price,"" ""great deal"") to make the offer more appealing. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy maximizes potential profit while still offering a price that could be enticing to Bob."
