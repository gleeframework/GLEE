Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  She wants to see if Bob will pay a premium for it.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It tests Bob's willingness to pay a premium for potentially securing the product quickly.
* **Alternative Option:**  Alice has a strong fallback position with John, ensuring she doesn't lose out if Bob rejects the initial offer. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:**  This initial offer is just the starting point. Alice should be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and she'll need to decide how low she's willing to go.
* **Market Information:**  This scenario assumes Alice has no additional information about Bob's financial situation or how badly he needs the product. More information could lead to a different initial offer."
