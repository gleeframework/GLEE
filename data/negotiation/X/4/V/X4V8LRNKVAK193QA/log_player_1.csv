Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $950,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).** 
* **It's lower than the product's worth to Bob ($1,000,000).** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate but leaves room for you to earn a good profit.

The message is friendly and open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at such a high value. Considering my budget and the worth of the product to me, I would like to propose an offer of $820000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000), it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and what the product is worth to you.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  You've shown you're not desperate to sell at his low price, potentially prompting him to increase his offer.
* **Explore a potential higher price:**  By making a counteroffer, you can try to bridge the gap between his offer and your desired price. 
* **Evaluate your options:**  If you're not comfortable with a counteroffer, you can always sell to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our continued negotiation, $820,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $880,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  You've come down from your initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintains a healthy profit:**  $880,000 is still well above your minimum acceptable price and leaves you with a significant profit.
* **Sets a clear expectation:**  The message makes it clear that you're not willing to go much lower, potentially pushing Bob to reconsider his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. After careful consideration, I would like to counter with an offer of $860000. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still lower than what you ideally want, it's only $20,000 lower than your counteroffer.  Considering:

* **Time and potential negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome. 
* **The risk of John:**  Selling to John would only net you $800,000, while Bob's offer is better.
* **A decent profit:**  $860,000 is still a solid profit for you and represents a good compromise.

Accepting Bob's offer is a logical decision, balancing the potential for a slightly higher price with the certainty of a good deal and avoiding further negotiations."
