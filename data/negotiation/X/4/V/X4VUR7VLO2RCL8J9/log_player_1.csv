"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really appreciate. My starting price is $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm mentioning the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him that it's worth something to him. 
* **Open Ended:**  I'm asking for his opinion to gauge his interest and potentially start the bargaining process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only do $100 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.
* **John is a backup:**  I know John is willing to pay $150, giving me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a great deal for both of us, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Highlight the value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging to maintain a good rapport with Bob."
