"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1400000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our discussion.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you a price of $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1250000. I'm willing to make a final push and offer $1220000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1220000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're making a final push, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1220000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you a price of $1230000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to accept.",1230000.0,Alice,7,
