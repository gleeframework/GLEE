"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,000? This price still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. Let's make this happen!",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $16,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $12,500? I'm eager to find an agreement and get this deal done.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm still keen to make this deal work, I can't go lower than $14,000. It's a significant discount from my original asking price, and it still allows you to purchase a product worth significantly more. Let's try to bridge this gap.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are.",13000.0,Bob,6,
