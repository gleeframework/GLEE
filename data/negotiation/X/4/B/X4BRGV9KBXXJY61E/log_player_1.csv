Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm interested in the product but would need a price closer to $850,000 to make it work for me.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
