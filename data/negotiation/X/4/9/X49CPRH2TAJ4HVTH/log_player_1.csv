Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to work with me. I'm very close to accepting, but I'd like to see if we can meet at $1,330,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,330,000 is the most strategic decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** This price still yields a significant profit above my minimum ($1,200,000). 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Dragging the negotiation further risks frustrating Bob and potentially losing the deal altogether.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows me to reinvest the money sooner, potentially earning additional returns. 
 
Bob is clearly motivated to buy, and this offer represents a fair compromise. Accepting now ensures a profitable and timely conclusion to the negotiation."
