"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, I need to stay closer to my initial offer to ensure a fair deal for both of us. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,350,000, which I believe is still a competitive price considering the product's value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $1,275,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a price that works for you, but $1,275,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which reflects a compromise on both our ends. This offer is still within a reasonable range considering the product's value to your business.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,287,500?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",1287500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence in finding a solution. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,287,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,295,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my commitment to a mutually beneficial deal.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this price, I may need to consider other options.",1295000.0,Alice,7,
