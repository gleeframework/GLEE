"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong opening offer significantly above both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This establishes a high anchor point and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, justifying the high price.  
* **Leaving Room:**  While I aim high, the offer isn't outrageous. It allows room for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while gauging Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value ($1,200,000), it's still significantly below my minimum ($1,500,000) and my initial ask. I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm serious about a higher price and prompt him to improve his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,300,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000, reflecting its significant value and future returns for your business."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial concession from my initial offer ($200,000 reduction) to show flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Holding Firm:**  My counteroffer is still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum price, maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value proposition, aiming to justify the price and shift Bob's focus towards the potential benefits.

This strategy balances making progress in the negotiation with maintaining a position to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,550,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us, acknowledging the product's potential and staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to negotiate for more, it's unlikely Bob will go much higher. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of the deal falling through in further rounds."
