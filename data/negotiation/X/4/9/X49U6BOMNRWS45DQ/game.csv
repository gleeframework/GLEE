"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm still confident that this product has the potential to generate significant value for you. To reflect that potential and bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows me to achieve my desired outcome while offering you a very competitive deal. I'm open to further discussion, but I believe this is a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
