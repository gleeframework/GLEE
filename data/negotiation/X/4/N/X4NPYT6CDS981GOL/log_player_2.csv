You can do better than $95. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

You're willing to pay the maximum you're comfortable with, and it's still a good deal for Alice since it's more than what she'd get from John."

It's still worth trying to negotiate further. You're closer to your target price, but it's not worth giving up now. You'll try to make a counteroffer again."

While you could continue negotiating, the price is getting closer to your maximum. It's now worth it to secure the product from John for $80. You've saved yourself a few dollars and avoided further negotiation rounds."
