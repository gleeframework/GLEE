"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, you can likely do better. Alice values the product at $10,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  How about $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $11,000, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for me.  It's within my budget and a decent compromise.  At this point, it's worth accepting the offer and avoiding further negotiations."
