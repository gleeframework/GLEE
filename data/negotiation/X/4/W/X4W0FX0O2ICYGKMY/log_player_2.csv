It's better to try to negotiate with Alice. $120 is still too high, and you have room to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering $100, which is still a good deal for both of us. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $140 is too high. While I could buy from John for $150, I'm going to try to get a better price from Alice. I'm confident I can negotiate a lower price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering $120. This is a fair price, considering the previous offers and rounds. It also gives Alice a profit while still being within my budget."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, but there are only 3 rounds left. At this rate, it's unlikely I'll be able to get a better deal from Alice within these rounds.  It's best to buy from John to ensure I get the product."
