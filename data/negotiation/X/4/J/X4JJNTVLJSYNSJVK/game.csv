"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredibly valuable product.  Its worth far exceeds its price tag, and I believe it would be a tremendous asset to you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle - I can come down to $1,125,000.  This is my final offer.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,125,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. I believe it's a good compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
