"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9250?  That gives you a good deal, and still leaves me some room to make a profit. Let me know what you think!",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is a fair compromise.  This price still allows me to make a profit, and it's very close to your offer.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
