{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, giving him room to negotiate, but also significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000. This leaves room for potential counteroffers and gives me some flexibility in the negotiation.  I'm also keeping John's offer in mind, as a fallback option if the negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, as I have room to lower my price while still making a profit.  I'll use the opportunity of the next round to counter with a price closer to my desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,250?  That gives you a good deal, and still leaves me some room to make a profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,800 is closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to push for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to $9,000 through further negotiation, making it worthwhile to reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation.  I'll be mindful of John's offer as a safety net, though, as I don't want to lose too much time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  This price still allows me to make a profit, and it's very close to your offer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in buying the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is below my minimum price of $12,000, and I've already made several counteroffers.  While I am determined to make a profit, the negotiation with Bob has become time-consuming, and his counteroffers are not getting closer to my desired price point. It is time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed deal with John."
