"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product,  $14,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,500 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $11,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
