Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at the price of $9,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, trying to sell to Bob first allows me to potentially earn an extra $1,500.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,500 creates a sense of urgency (limited-time offer) and a significant perceived value for Bob. It's a price point that's significantly lower than my minimum but still leaves room for me to profit considerably more than selling to John. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests there might be some flexibility, allowing Bob to feel like he could potentially negotiate the price down slightly if he's hesitant."
