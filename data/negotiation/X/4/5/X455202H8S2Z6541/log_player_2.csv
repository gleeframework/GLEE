"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. While I can't disclose all the details just yet, I'm confident it's worth at least $10000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe you'll be happy with the investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. You know you can buy the product for the same price from John. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  You can always negotiate with John if you want to try and get a lower price."
