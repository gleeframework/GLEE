"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to still make a profit while getting me a great price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take that price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $875,000 for the product. This gives you a solid profit while still saving me some money compared to your last offer.  What do you say?

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $875,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my target than John's offer, and it ensures a sale without risking further negotiation."
