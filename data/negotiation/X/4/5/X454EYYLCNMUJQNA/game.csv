"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,450,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,450,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  This price is still fair considering the value you place on it and allows for a healthy profit for you.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This allows me a fair profit while still offering you a competitive price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This price is a fair compromise, as it allows you to make a substantial profit while also giving me a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
