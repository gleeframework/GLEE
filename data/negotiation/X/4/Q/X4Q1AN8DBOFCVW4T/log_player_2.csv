"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially save $3,000 by negotiating with Alice. While $12,000 is a good price, it's worth trying to get it lower.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a significant price reduction, which might be appealing to Alice. This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget and offers a good starting point for negotiation. It's important to be polite and show interest in the product while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met Bob halfway, bringing the price down to $11,000. This is a good price for Bob, as he's saving $4,000 compared to buying from John. While there's always a possibility of negotiating further, the risk of Alice walking away or the negotiation taking too long outweighs the potential for an additional $1,000 savings.  It's a good deal for Bob, and it's time to accept."
