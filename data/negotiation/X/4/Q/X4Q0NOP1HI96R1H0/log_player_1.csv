Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest in the product, $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to secure a higher price. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm appreciative of your flexibility, but $875,000 is still slightly below my bottom line. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $887,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to continue negotiating with you."", ""product_price"": 887500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but $887,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000. Can we meet in the middle again?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $880,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum and secures a deal. It's also better than selling to John for $800,000.  I'm running out of time, and I want to close this deal before I risk losing the opportunity altogether."
