,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest in the product, $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this deal work. It's a fair compromise that still leaves a significant profit margin for me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. Can you consider that?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm appreciative of your flexibility, but $875,000 is still slightly below my bottom line. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $887,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to continue negotiating with you.",887500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but $887,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000. Can we meet in the middle again?",880000.0,Bob,6,
