"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get as close to my budget as possible. Can you consider my counteroffer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and your interest. I understand your budget considerations, however,  $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $19,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $19,000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my new offer?",16000.0,Bob,4,
