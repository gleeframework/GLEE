"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a significant compromise for you, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer you the product for $850,000. This is a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
