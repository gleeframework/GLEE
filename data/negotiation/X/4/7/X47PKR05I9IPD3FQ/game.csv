"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a bit more in line with my budget and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet on this price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product and your offer.  However, $900,000 significantly undervalues its true potential.  I could consider a price of $1,075,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the immense value this brings.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
