Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, so feel free to share your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a bit more in line with my budget and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product and your offer.  However, $900,000 significantly undervalues its true potential.  I could consider a price of $1,075,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the immense value this brings."", ""product_price"": 1075000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's anchoring his negotiations significantly lower than the product's worth. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000 which is a solid profit and avoids further potentially frustrating negotiation."
