{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it gives him some room to negotiate without going below your minimum.  It also leaves room for counter-offers and keeps the negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

While $1,150,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm going to make one more counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."
