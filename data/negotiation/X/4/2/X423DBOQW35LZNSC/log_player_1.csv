I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept from John because I want to see if I can get closer to my desired value. This also leaves room for negotiation."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping I can get him closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above what I would accept from John.  This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to keep negotiating."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable value. It's not worth risking further negotiation with him.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
