"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $125. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $125 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $95.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to buy it.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $115. It's a good price that should make both of us happy.",115.0,Alice,5,
