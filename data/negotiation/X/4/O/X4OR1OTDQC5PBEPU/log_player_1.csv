Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum, but it's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially open the door to a negotiation.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's profitable for me but also attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what I consider the product to be worth. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a slight concession from my initial offer, but it still reflects the value I place on the product. I hope this counteroffer is appealing enough to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob, the price difference between his offer and what I need to get is still significant. It's not worth the time and effort to keep negotiating at this point, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price. Selling to John ensures I meet my financial goals and can move on to other opportunities."
