{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. I think it's a great deal, and you'll definitely get your money's worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob more likely to consider my offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not aiming for the full $150 right away, as I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $150 gives me confidence to hold my ground if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell for that amount.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob is interested, I believe I can push him higher. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me leverage to reject Bob's initial counteroffer and continue negotiating."

{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and go with $140?  That's still a great price for this product, and it gives us both a win."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is still a good value at $140.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and optimistic tone to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price, allowing for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget of $80. Would you be willing to go down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $130 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my preferred value.
* **Potential for a higher offer:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and is clearly interested in the product. I believe there's room for a better offer. 
* **John as a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $150 if this negotiation doesn't lead to a more favorable outcome."

{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you're really keen on this product, and I want to make this work for both of us. $130 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession by reducing my price to $135. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win scenario for both of us, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to maintain good rapport.
* **Final offer?:** While I'm willing to go down to $135, I might be less likely to go lower, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $150.  

Let's see what Bob decides!"

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited negotiation room:**  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and I'm not sure I can convince Bob to go much higher.
* **John is the better option:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob. 

I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John."
