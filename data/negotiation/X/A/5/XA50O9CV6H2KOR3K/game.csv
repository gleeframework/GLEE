"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and go with $140?  That's still a great price for this product, and it gives us both a win.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget of $80. Would you be willing to go down to $130?",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you're really keen on this product, and I want to make this work for both of us. $130 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",135.0,Alice,5,
