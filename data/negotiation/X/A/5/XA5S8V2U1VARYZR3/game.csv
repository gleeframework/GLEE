,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,750,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is the price I was offered by John, the other seller. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle somewhere.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,250,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle at $1,400,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,400,000, which would be $1,300,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise again.  I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which is the price I mentioned earlier. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
