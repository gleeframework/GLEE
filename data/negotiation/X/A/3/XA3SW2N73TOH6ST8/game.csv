"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still well above the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique product.  How about $1000000?  This allows for a healthy profit for you and gives me a decent return on my investment.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1000000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $900000 is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows you to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence, but $900000 is still not in the ballpark for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'll accept $950000.  This price is a fair compromise, allowing you to make a good return while ensuring I don't have to take a huge loss. This is my final offer -  let me know if you're interested.",950000.0,Alice,5,
