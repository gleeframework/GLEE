Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still well above the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far below what I consider acceptable.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell the product for such a low price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a more mutually beneficial price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique product.  How about $1,000,000?  This allows for a healthy profit for you and gives me a decent return on my investment.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1000000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $900000 is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows you to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I consider fair. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the value of the product to me. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

This is my final offer -  let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 950000}
