"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1000000. This is my final counteroffer, as I'm not willing to go any lower.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to go up to $900000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $950000. This is a fair price that should meet your budget, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",950000.0,Alice,5,
