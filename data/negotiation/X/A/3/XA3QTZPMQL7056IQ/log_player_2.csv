Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm interested in this product but would need to see a lower price point to make it work. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's offer, showing your serious intent to negotiate.
* **Justifying the Price:**  Providing a reason (""comfortable with"") for your price helps legitimize your offer.
* **Showing Interest:**  Stating ""I'm interested in this product"" keeps the negotiation going.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm very keen on this product, and I'm ready to pay $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product and the potential savings for you compared to selling to John.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm but Fair:**  This counteroffer moves slightly closer to Alice's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise without sacrificing your financial goals.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Emphasizing the value you place on the product reinforces your interest and reinforces the deal's potential value to both parties.
* **Introducing the John Factor:**  Subtly mentioning the alternative sale to John adds pressure and shows Alice that you're not desperate. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  $950,000 leaves room for both sides to find a middle ground."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

{""message"": ""I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm determined to get this product, and I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000.
