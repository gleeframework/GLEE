I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe you'll find it's worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000.,1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm interested in this product but would need to see a lower price point to make it work. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to consider the value this product holds for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm very keen on this product, and I'm ready to pay $950000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product and the potential savings for you compared to selling to John.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not ready to give up on the higher end of the price scale just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to feel confident I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1050000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $1050000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm determined to get this product, and I'm willing to offer you $1000000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows you to sell at a profit.  Let's make a deal and finalize this transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
