Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad to see we're getting close to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $702,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

At this point, Alice has come down significantly, and the price difference is getting smaller.  It's unlikely further haggling will yield a much better result, and it's starting to feel like nickel-and-diming.  Accepting at $702,500 secures a decent discount and avoids the risk of the deal falling through."
