"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of offering $140 for it. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to try to get as close to the price I'm comfortable with as possible.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $155? That way we both get a good deal.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go lower than $149.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's settle this now.",149.0,Alice,5,
