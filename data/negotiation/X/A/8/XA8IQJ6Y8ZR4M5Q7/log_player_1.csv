"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  This also gives Bob room to counteroffer without me feeling like I'm giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is better than nothing, I still think I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm sticking to my minimum price. This is a fair offer given that Bob is willing to pay $125, and I'm not willing to go lower than $150."
