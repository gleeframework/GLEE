"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $95. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from what the product is worth to him, but still above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it still leaves me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $87 is above my minimum acceptable price and John's offer.  It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
