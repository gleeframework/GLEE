"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be within my budget of $1,000,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident in the value this product brings, and I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we settle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
