Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to my business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1050000. Can you consider this counteroffer?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price but it's still significantly lower than my initial offer.  We've only got two rounds left, and the price is not moving at a rate that would make it worth it to continue negotiating.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the most logical choice at this point. It's guaranteed money and while it's not my preferred outcome, it's still a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
