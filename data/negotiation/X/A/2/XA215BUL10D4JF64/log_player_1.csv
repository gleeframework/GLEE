{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts with a fair price that is a bit higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a friendly tone, hoping to encourage a positive interaction with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but that price is a little high for me. Could you do it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is above my minimum, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and I believe I can get closer to my target price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $130?  That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $130 is a bit closer but still a touch high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That seems fair. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get closer to $130, accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
