{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth significantly exceeds that for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** Offering it too close to $1,200,000 might scare Bob off, knowing he values it less. This offer acknowledges his potential gain while still aiming high for Alice. 
* **Alternative Buyer Security:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides a strong safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out."
