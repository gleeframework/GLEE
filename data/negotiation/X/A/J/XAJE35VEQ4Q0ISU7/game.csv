,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price if we continue this negotiation.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and my current financial constraints. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price if we continue this discussion.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but unfortunately, I cannot go lower than $900,000. This price is still a good deal considering the value of the product to you. I'm hoping we can find a compromise here.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find common ground.  While $900,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering both our needs. Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find common ground. While I would prefer to close the deal at a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $890,000.
