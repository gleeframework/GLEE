"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,600,000. I know it's worth $1,500,000 to you, but I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer ready to pay $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

You can get the product for a lower price from John.  While it's tempting to accept Alice's offer, you can save $100,000 by rejecting it and buying from John."
