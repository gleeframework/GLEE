"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is the maximum you're willing to pay.  There's no immediate benefit to accepting. Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $1,150,000. This is still within your budget and represents a significant discount from her initial price.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your next counteroffer and you might be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product for you at a favorable price."
