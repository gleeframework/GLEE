"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality item at a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000). This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. Based on my budget, I am willing to offer $15000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). There is no reason to risk further negotiation. Accepting his offer guarantees me the best possible deal in this scenario."
