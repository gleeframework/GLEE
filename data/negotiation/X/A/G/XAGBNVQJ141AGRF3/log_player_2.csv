"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value, I propose a price of $120 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $150, but $120 is still too much.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You want to try and get the price lower before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, given its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:**  A significant price drop shows your serious intent to negotiate while still leaving room for compromise. 
* **Reasoning:** Providing a clear reason for your offer makes it less likely Alice feels you're just being unreasonable.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message avoids being overly firm, suggesting you're willing to adjust if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To better align with your budget while still ensuring fair compensation for our product, I propose a price of $110. This offer reflects a compromise that takes into account both the value of the product and your willingness to pay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's compromise:** Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair price:** While $110 is still above your ideal price, it's within your budget and represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice becoming more stubborn or potentially walking away from the deal. 
* **Time constraint:**  You have limited rounds and don't want to waste them.  Accepting now is the most sensible option to secure the product within your budget."
