,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $9,250.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $9,250. How about we meet at $8,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price point but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference at $9,000.  This way, we both get a good deal and can move forward with the transaction. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,800. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate you coming up to $8,800. However, that's still a bit below my minimum.  To make this work, I'd need $8,900. This is a small difference, and I believe we can find common ground.",8900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, which is the price I was originally thinking. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",8750.0,Bob,8,
