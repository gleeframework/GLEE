Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $130. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without him rejecting the offer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still ensuring you're well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it for $80 right away might make Bob think it's worth less or that you're desperate to sell.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
