Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, we have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John. Therefore, we start the negotiation significantly above Bob's valuation.
* **Room for negotiation:** The offered price of $1,300,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's high value without explicitly stating our minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize profit:**  Secure the highest possible price from Bob.
2. **Secure a sale:** Avoid a lowball offer from Bob, ensuring we don't miss out on John's guaranteed purchase."
