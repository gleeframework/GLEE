Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,500."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so he's potentially willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,500 gives Bob a good deal while still allowing you to maximize your profit. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's exact willingness to pay. If you had more information about Bob's financial situation or how badly he needs the product, you could potentially push for a higher price."
