"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant step for me. I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll meet you at $1,025,000. I think this price is a good compromise and reflects the value the product will bring to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
