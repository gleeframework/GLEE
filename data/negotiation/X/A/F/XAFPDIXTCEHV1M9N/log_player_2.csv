"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $11,000.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. You have 10 rounds, so you can try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. It also signals to Alice that you are serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is only willing to lower the price slightly.  You can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's better to try and squeeze out a bit more of a discount rather than settle for a price that's still higher than your ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is still below Alice's minimum selling price, but it's closer to her target than your previous offer. It shows that you are willing to compromise but still want a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still holding out for a price that's too high. You can still likely negotiate a lower price. Even though you've rejected several offers, you've shown Alice you're serious about getting a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a compromise. It's higher than your ideal price, but it's significantly lower than Alice's current offer. Since this is round 6, you're running out of time. This offer shows Alice you're serious but also signals that you're getting closer to the point of buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not willing to budge much further. You've tried multiple counteroffers, and the price isn't getting any closer to your ideal. With only 3 rounds left, you're running out of time, and the risk of not getting the product at all is increasing. 

While $12,000 is above your desired price, it's still a reasonable price for you, and you're guaranteed to get the product. You have to weigh the potential for a small discount against the risk of losing the opportunity entirely."
