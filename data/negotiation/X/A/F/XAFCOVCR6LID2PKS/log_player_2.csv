"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $100 is my absolute minimum.  Let me know if you're interested at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.
