"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180, which is a reasonable starting point given the product's worth to both of us.  I'm hoping to maximize my profit while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum price of $150. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $165, which is still above my minimum price of $150.  I'm hoping this is a more acceptable price for Bob, but I'm still not willing to go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price. There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
``` 

I'm dropping the price again to $155, which is just a few dollars away from my minimum price. I'm hoping this will finally convince Bob to accept the offer. If he rejects this offer, I'll still have a few rounds left to negotiate, but I might consider selling to John at that point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting frustrating! While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, we are not converging on a price.  I've already rejected his offer twice, and his counteroffer is still below my minimum.  It's not worth risking further rounds of negotiation. I'm going to sell to John, as I'm guaranteed $150, which meets my minimum goal."
