"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum price. You should make a counteroffer significantly lower than $120 to start negotiating a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's the original price I had in mind, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

Alice has met your maximum price. There's no point in further negotiation or buying from John at the same price."
