"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true value and I'm open to discussing this further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. How about we aim for $1,200,000? I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000 to find a middle ground.  This offer reflects my desire to strike a fair deal. ",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $2,000,000 is quite high for my current budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $1,600,000? I believe this could be a fair compromise for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
