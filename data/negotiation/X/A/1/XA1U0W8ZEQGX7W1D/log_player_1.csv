Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. How about we aim for $1,200,000? I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000 to find a middle ground.  This offer reflects my desire to strike a fair deal. "",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $2,000,000 is quite high for my current budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $1,600,000? I believe this could be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiation going south and ending up with John's offer."
