"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth exactly that to you. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the transaction. If not, I have another buyer lined up, so I'm not under pressure to sell at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly stating she won't go lower and that the product is worth the asking price to you.  While this might be true, there's no room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, you can see if she'll counter with a lower price. If not, you can always buy from John at the same price."
