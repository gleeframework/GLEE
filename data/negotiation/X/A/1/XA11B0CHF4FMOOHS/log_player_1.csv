Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives room for negotiation and makes me appear flexible.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the product's value to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies that I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's closer to my minimum price.
* If Bob's offer is too low, I'll counter with a price closer to $175.
* If the negotiation stalls, I'll consider selling to John for $150 as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for counter-negotiation:**  Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. This suggests there's potential to reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  I have the option of selling to John for $150, so I'm not in a desperate situation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter with a price that's closer to my desired range, likely somewhere between $135-$145. This shows flexibility while still protecting my minimum profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $140 is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Emphasize value:**  I reiterate the value the product offers to Bob, reinforcing the reason why $140 is fair.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  The message remains open to further negotiation, suggesting I'm open to finding common ground.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I've secured a sale at a price that meets my minimum profit margin. 
* If Bob rejects again, I'll need to assess his next counteroffer.
* If negotiation stalls, I'll consider selling to John as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** $130 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of losing the sale:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I'll have to settle for John's offer at $150.
* **Time factor:**  The negotiation is already going on for a while, and further delays could lead to a better deal for me.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal. I've secured a sale that's reasonably close to my desired price and avoided the risk of losing the sale altogether."
