{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you've placed on the product. However, I'm looking to invest closer to $700,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price within this range. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's seriousness in saving money.

* **Open-ended:** The message leaves room for Alice to counter, keeping the negotiation dynamic."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price is $700000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's exceptional quality and features, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a revised price of $775000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Still room for improvement:** There's still a gap between Alice's offer and Bob's target price. 
* **Maintain leverage:** Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price, while keeping the option to buy from John as a fallback."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $775,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to finalize a deal closer to $750,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the product's value while allowing for a profitable investment for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```
