,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,110.0
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again at $95. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer who values the product as much as I do.",95.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,105.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $95 just yet. I'm willing to compromise again, and I'll meet you at $105. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",105.0,Alice,5,,
