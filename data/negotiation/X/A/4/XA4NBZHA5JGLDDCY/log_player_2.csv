"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to lower the price significantly.  I have a decent fallback option with John, so I'm not desperate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd only be willing to pay $6,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) to gauge Alice's flexibility. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Aiming for a Good Deal:** My goal is to get the product for a price closer to my limit ($8,000), saving as much as possible. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Having John's offer in my back pocket gives me leverage. I'm not afraid to walk away if Alice doesn't budge enough."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:** Alice moved a lot closer to my range, but it's still above what John is offering. 
* **Final offer bluff:**  People often say ""final offer"" in negotiations, but it doesn't always mean it's truly their last word.
* **Worth a shot:** I'll try one more time to get closer to $8,000. If Alice is firm, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can do. How about $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($8,500) and my previous one ($6,000).  
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will show if she's truly firm or if there's a little more wiggle room.
* **Ready for John:**  I'm prepared to walk away if Alice doesn't budge. $8,000 from John is still a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $8,000, and that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Matched my limit:** Alice has finally met my price limit of $8,000. 
* **No point in pushing further:**  I've successfully negotiated her down, and there's no benefit to trying to go lower. John's offer is the same, so I might as well buy from Alice now. 
* **A good deal:** I'm getting the product for a price I'm comfortable with, even if it's less than what Alice valued it at."
