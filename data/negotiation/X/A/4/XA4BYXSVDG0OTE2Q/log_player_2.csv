"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating further. While $1,200,000 is a better deal than buying from John, there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a great product, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This price is fair given its value to me, and it allows you to still make a healthy profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the profit I'd like to make. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good deal. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still leaves a good margin for Alice.  While you could potentially negotiate further, there's no guarantee of a better deal, and it risks losing the opportunity to purchase the product at a fair price."
