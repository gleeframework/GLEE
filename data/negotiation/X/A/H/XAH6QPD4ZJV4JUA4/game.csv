"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, I'm looking to spend closer to $11000 for this product.  Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $12500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $12000? It's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $12000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll counter with $13200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",13200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down, $13200 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $12800 as a compromise.  It's closer to my target and allows you to make a profit.",12800.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $12800 is still not enough for me to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll counter with $13500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",13500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $13500.  Let's try $13000 as a final compromise. This would give you a decent profit and allow me to stay within my budget.  It's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob, but I still need to get closer to my target. I'll counter with $14000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",14000.0,Alice,9,
