Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it for $12,000 immediately might make Bob think it's not worth that much.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has the security of John's offer, so she can be firmer with Bob.

**The message strikes a balance between confidence in the product's value and a willingness to engage in a discussion with Bob.**"
