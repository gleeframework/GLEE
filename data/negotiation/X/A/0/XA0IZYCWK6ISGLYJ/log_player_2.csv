"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering.  It makes sense to reject this offer and aim for a better deal."
