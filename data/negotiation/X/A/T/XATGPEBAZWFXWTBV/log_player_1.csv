"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and prove to be a wise investment."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and slightly below our minimum ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""unique value"" aims to justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** We want Bob to engage in the bargaining process, so we present the price as a starting point for discussion. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's willingness to pay:**  His response will reveal if he's willing to approach our target range.
2. **Anchor the negotiation:**  Starting high can influence Bob's counteroffers, potentially leading to a higher final price.

We'll adjust our approach based on Bob's reaction in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the product, your initial price is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, as I believe it's a fair value for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable number. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While he's showing some willingness to negotiate, accepting at this stage would mean a substantial loss. We have room to negotiate and gauge his flexibility.  We'll provide a counteroffer in the next round to guide the negotiation closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the value this product brings.  However, to make this a worthwhile deal for both of us, I'd need to see the price closer to $1,050,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  I'm confident we can find a suitable agreement."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've lowered our price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still staying above Bob's initial offer and our minimum price.
* **Justification:**  We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Encouraging a Counteroffer:** By positioning our price closer to Bob's, we encourage him to make another, hopefully higher, counteroffer. 

We'll continue to analyze Bob's responses and adjust our strategy accordingly, keeping in mind the guaranteed $1,200,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product. Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress! Bob is clearly interested and increasing his offer. However, $900,000 is still considerably lower than our $1,200,000 walk-away point (selling to John).  There's room for negotiation, and we'll counter in the next round to bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price point. Your interest in the product is clear. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** By stating this is our final offer, we introduce a sense of urgency and signal the end of concessions from our side.
* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** We decrease the price by $50,000, a substantial amount that might entice Bob while staying above John's offer.
* **Balanced Justification:** We're still emphasizing the product's value while recognizing Bob's efforts to find common ground.

This approach aims to:

1. **Push Bob to his limit:**  He might be willing to accept $1,000,000 to avoid losing the deal.
2. **Maintain a strong position:**  If he rejects this, we can confidently walk away knowing John guarantees $1,200,000.

The next round will be crucial in determining if we close the deal with Bob or proceed with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I acknowledge the value of this product, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a considerable increase from my previous offer. It's a fair price considering our negotiation so far. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly below our target and the guaranteed offer from John.  We've used several tactics to try and bridge the gap, including significant price reductions and a ""final offer"" strategy.  

At this point, continuing the negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. We risk:

* **Further price concessions:** Bob might be encouraged to hold firm, knowing we're invested in the negotiation.
* **Losing John's offer:** While we have a guaranteed buyer, there's always a chance circumstances could change if the negotiation drags on. 

Therefore, accepting John's guaranteed $1,200,000 is the most logical decision, ensuring the highest profit with minimal risk."
