"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's truly one-of-a-kind, and I believe it can be a great asset for your business. My initial offer is $900,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value it holds. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000, but I think we can do better than that. Can you meet me in the middle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $725,000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's meet halfway again. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This would still allow me to achieve my target price while also giving you a good deal. I'm confident we can find common ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $675,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're still a bit apart on price. While $675,000 is a good offer, it's unfortunately not enough for me to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $750,000. This would be a good price for both of us and allow us to close this deal. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,5,
