"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product with you. I believe it has tremendous potential and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a fallback option with John for $1,000,000. There's a chance you can get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down further."
