Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above my minimum of $100, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle.  I'm hoping to get closer to the $150 value he places on the product, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for $100 if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $115? It's still a good price for you, and a great deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I want to close the deal, I need to hold firm on my value for the product. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to my value for the product."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
