"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $16,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is way above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can reach a more agreeable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Could you meet me halfway at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

While $13,000 is closer to your budget, it's still over your ideal price point. You can try to negotiate further with Alice."
