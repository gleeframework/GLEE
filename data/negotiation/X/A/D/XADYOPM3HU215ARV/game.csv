"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  I believe this offer reflects its fair market value.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm proposing $975,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the product's worth.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but your current offer is still outside my budget. I can increase my offer to $725,000.  This is a considerable increase on my end, and I hope it demonstrates my serious interest in reaching a deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider $890,000. This offer reflects my desire to close a deal while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is closer to what I had in mind, but still a bit high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $775,000. I feel this is a fair compromise and reflects a good deal for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation, but your latest offer doesn't reflect the significant value this product brings.  I'm willing to make my final offer of $850,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's potential. ",850000.0,Alice,7,
