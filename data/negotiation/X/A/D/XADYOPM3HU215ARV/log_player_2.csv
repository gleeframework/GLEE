Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation, but your latest offer doesn't reflect the significant value this product brings.  I'm willing to make my final offer of $850,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's potential.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer and she's unlikely to go below $850,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk. You have a guaranteed option with John for $800,000, saving you $50,000."
