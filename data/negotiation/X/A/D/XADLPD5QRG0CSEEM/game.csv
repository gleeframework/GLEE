This is a substantial discount, and I'm sure you'll find it an attractive proposition. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850000 is a bit too far below my desired price. I'm willing to compromise, however. How about we split the difference and go with $900000?  I believe this would be a mutually beneficial deal, and we can both walk away happy.",900000.0,Alice,3,
