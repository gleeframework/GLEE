Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $14,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $13,500.  Buying from John at $12,000 guarantees the best price for Bob."
