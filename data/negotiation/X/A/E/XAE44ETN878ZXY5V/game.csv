"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point, but I'm still not comfortable selling at $1,175,000.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. It's also a better deal for you than going with John, who is willing to pay that exact amount.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
