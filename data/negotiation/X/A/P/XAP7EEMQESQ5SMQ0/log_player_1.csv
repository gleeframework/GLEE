Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $12,000? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach $15,000.  It's time to cut negotiations and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
