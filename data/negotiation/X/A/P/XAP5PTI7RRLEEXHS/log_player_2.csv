"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $13,000 is above your maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  You can always go to John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** I'm starting with my maximum budget of $10,000. This establishes my firm limit and sets the stage for negotiations.
* **No room for compromise:**  I'm not willing to pay more than $10,000. Alice needs to come down to my price or I'll go to John.
* **Time is on my side:** With 10 rounds, I can afford to be firm and see if Alice is willing to meet my price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  $12,000 is still outside of my budget. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Alice has come down a bit, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **John is always an option:**  If I can't get a better price, I can still buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Alice's last offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Testing the waters:**  I want to see if Alice is willing to come down further.
* **Still below my limit:**  $11,000 is still below my maximum budget of $10,000."
