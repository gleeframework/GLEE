Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing Message:** The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" for both parties, creating a positive frame.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** $1,400,000 allows for a few rounds of counteroffers without reaching my minimum price.
* **The Plan:** I aim to reach a compromise somewhere between $1,400,000 and my minimum price of $1,500,000.  If Bob rejects, I'll use counteroffers to push closer to my desired price point.  If negotiations stall, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he's still interested. This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point.

I'll aim to counter with an offer slightly above his $1,200,000 but significantly lower than my minimum. This will keep negotiations moving and hopefully reach a compromise closer to my target price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm confident it's still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $1,300,000 is halfway between my previous offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,200,000. This shows willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  $1,300,000 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't sell below my value.
* **Positive Messaging:** My message emphasizes the ""good deal"" for both parties, encouraging Bob to see the benefits of accepting my counteroffer. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining my desired price range. If Bob rejects, I can further adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,100,000 is even lower than his previous offer and significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Stalling:** Bob's offer shows he's unwilling to budge much. Continuing to negotiate with him could lead to a stalemate.
* **Time is Money:**  My time is valuable, and continuing to negotiate with Bob could mean missing out on a guaranteed sale to John.

**Next Move:** I'll counter Bob's offer, but this time I'll also include a clear deadline.  I'll make it clear that if he doesn't accept my counteroffer by [date], I'll be moving forward with selling to John. This will put pressure on Bob to finalize the deal or risk losing out on the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is my final offer.  If you're not able to accept by [Date], I'll be moving forward with another buyer.  Let me know what you decide."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my last offer, creating a sense of urgency and emphasizing the need for a decision.
* **Deadline:** The deadline gives Bob a concrete timeframe to consider the offer and encourages him to act quickly.
* **Slight Concession:**  While still above my minimum, this offer shows a slight concession to Bob's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The mention of another buyer adds pressure and emphasizes the risk of losing the product for Bob.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is designed to either secure a sale with Bob or force him to concede, paving the way for a sale to John if necessary."
