Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a price that's closer to Bob's value but still leaves room for potential counteroffers. It also sets a positive tone by framing it as a ""fair price."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000.  This price is still within your budget and represents a significant value for you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $900,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $875,000? I'm really interested in the product and think it's worth the investment, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my original goal of $950,000, Bob's offer of $875,000 is above my minimum price of $800,000 and also represents a good compromise. It's likely that further negotiations would just lead to more back-and-forth without guaranteeing a higher price."
