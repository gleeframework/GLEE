"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000,  which reflects the value I've placed on it.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering our mutual benefit from a successful transaction.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This price still reflects the value you've placed on the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is your maximum, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,225,000. This price is still above your maximum, but it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. I hope you'll consider it.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
