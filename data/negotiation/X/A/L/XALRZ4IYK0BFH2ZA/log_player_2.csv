**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best course of action, as it allows Bob to consider other options or negotiate further with Alice."
