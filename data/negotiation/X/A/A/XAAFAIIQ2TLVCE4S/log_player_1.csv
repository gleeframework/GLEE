Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. This would still be a good deal for both of us, as it's the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
