"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's desired $8,000. There are 9 more rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob wants to stay close to his $8,000 target.
* **Reasonable Counter:** $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiations, giving Alice some room to negotiate while still being within Bob's budget. 
* **Clear Communication:** Bob's message emphasizes his budget and shows willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has come down in price, but $9,250 is still above Bob's target of $8,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There are still 7 rounds remaining. This means Bob has more opportunities to try and push for a lower price.  
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $8,000 is tempting, Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, how about $8,750? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Close to Target:** Bob wants to stay close to his target price of $8,000 but also needs to be realistic.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** The counteroffer of $8,750 is precisely in the middle of Alice's last offer ($9,250) and Bob's previous offer ($8,500).  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** Bob's message remains polite and emphasizes the benefits of closing the deal at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we settle on $9,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a great value at this price. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice is continuing to come down in price, but $9,000 is still above Bob's target.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There are 5 rounds left.  Bob has more time to negotiate a lower price, potentially even closer to his goal of $8,000.
* **Risk Assessment:**  While John's offer of $8,000 is tempting, Bob may regret it if he could get an even better price by continuing negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,900, but that's really my absolute limit.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8900} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  Bob only increases his offer by $100, showing that he's serious about getting closer to his target.
* **Finality:**  He clearly states that this is his ""absolute limit,"" creating pressure on Alice. 
* **Compromise Emphasis:** Bob re-emphasizes the need for a solution that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. While $8,900 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000 one last time. This is truly a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!  If not, I'll be forced to pursue other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Further Progress:** Alice has stated that $9,000 is her final offer, indicating that further negotiations are unlikely to result in a lower price.
* **Time Running Out:**  There are only three rounds left. The risk of not getting a better deal from Alice outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $8,000 is now the best option available, as Bob can secure the product at his desired price."
